What Is M1?  

M1 is the money supply that is composed of currency, demand deposits, other liquid deposits—which includes savings deposits. M1 includes the most liquid portions of the money supply because it contains currency and assets that either are or can be quickly converted to cash. However, "near money" and "near, near money," which fall under M2 and M3, cannot be converted to currency as quickly.





Key Takeaways

M1 is a narrow measure of the money supply that includes currency, demand deposits, and other liquid deposits, including savings deposits.M1 does not include financial assets, such as bonds.The M1 is no longer used as a guide for monetary policy in the U.S. due to the lack of correlation between it and other economic variables.The M1 money supply was a much more constrictive measurement of the money supply compared to the M2 or M3 calculation. The M1 money supply is reported on a monthly basis by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.


   Understanding M1  

M1 money is a country’s basic money supply that's used as a medium of exchange. M1 includes demand deposits and checking accounts, which are the most commonly used exchange mediums through the use of debit cards and ATMs. Of all the components of the money supply, M1 is defined the most narrowly. M1 does not include financial assets, such as bonds. M1 money is the money supply metric most frequently utilized by economists to reference how much money is in circulation in a country.






Note that in May 2020, the definition of M1 changed to include savings accounts given the increased liquidity of such accounts.


   Money Supply and M1 in the United States  

Up until March 2006, the Federal Reserve published reports on three money aggregates: M1, M2, and M3. Since 2006, the Fed no longer publishes M3 data. M1 covers types of money commonly used for payment, which includes the most basic payment form, currency. The amount of currency in circulation or held in deposits at the Federal Reserve is called M0, or the monetary base.



M1 is defined as the sum of all currency in circulation, plus the value of most liquid deposits at commercial banks, except those held by the government, foreign banks, or other depository institutions. Because M1 is so narrowly defined, very few components are classified as M1. The broader classification, M2, also includes savings account deposits, small-time deposits, and retail money market accounts.



Closely related to M1 and M2 is Money Zero Maturity (MZM). MZM consists of M1 plus all money market accounts, including institutional money market funds. MZM represents all assets that are redeemable at par on demand and is designed to estimate the supply of readily circulating liquid money in the economy.



The money supply within the United States is graphically depicted by the Federal Reserve. The graphical depiction lists the money supply in billions of dollars on the y-axis and the date on the x-axis. The information is periodically updated on the Federal Reserve of St. Louis' site.






   How to Calculate M1  

The M1 money supply is composed of Federal Reserve notes—otherwise known as bills or paper money—and coins that are in circulation outside of the Federal Reserve Banks and the vaults of depository institutions. Paper money is the most significant component of a nation’s money supply.



M1 also includes traveler’s checks (of non-bank issuers), demand deposits, and other checkable deposits (OCDs), including NOW accounts at depository institutions and credit union share draft accounts.



For most central banks, M1 almost always includes money in circulation and readily cashable instruments. But there are slight variations on the definition across the world. For example, M1 in the eurozone also includes overnight deposits. In Australia, it includes current deposits from the private non-bank sector. The United Kingdom, however, does not use M0 or M1 class of money supply any longer; its primary measure is M4, or broad money, also known as the money supply. 






M2 and M3 include all of the components of M1 plus additional forms of money, including money market accounts, savings accounts, and institutional funds with significant balances.


   Money Supply and the U.S. Economy  

For periods of time, measurement of the money supply indicated a close relationship between money supply and some economic variables such as the gross domestic product (GDP), inflation, and price levels. Economists such as Milton Friedman argued in support of the theory that the money supply is intertwined with all of these variables.



However, in the past several decades, the relationship between some measurements of the money supply and other primary economic variables has been uncertain at best. Thus, the significance of the money supply acting as a guide for the conduct of monetary policy in the United States has substantially lessened.


   M1 vs. M2 vs. M3  

The M1 money supply includes all physical currency, traveler's checks, demand deposits, and other checkable deposits (e.g. checking accounts). While the M1 is a measure of all the most liquid forms of money in an economy, other forms of money supply are slightly different.



The M2 money supply is a broader measure of money supply that includes all components of M1 as well as "near money". M2 includes savings deposits, money market securities, and other time deposits which are less liquid and not as suitable as exchange mediums. Although many elements of the M2 money supply can can still be quickly converted into cash or checking deposits, they are not as instant as the components of the M1 money supply.



On the other hand, the M3 money supply is an even broader measure of the money supply that includes all components of M1 and M2. In addition, it includes all forms of savings deposits, money market deposits, time deposits in amounts of less than $100,000, and institutional money market funds. M3 is arguably the most comprehensive measure of the money supply compared to the other calculated amounts of money supply as it includes a wider range of savings and investments that can be readily converted into cash.


   How the M1 Money Supply Changes  

Governments intentionally change the money supply to have residual impacts on the broader economy. For example, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, governments increased the M1 money supply, making it easier to come about capital to help stimulate the economy, keep workers employed, and encourage business activity.



Central banks can increase the M1 money supply by increasing the amount of physical currency in circulation, lending money to banks, or purchasing securities on the open market. On the other hand, as seen in the aftermath of COVID-19, central banks reverse these policies to cool the economy to fight inflation.



Businesses and consumer spending also have an impact on the M1 money supply. As consumers and businesses spend more money, they create greater demand for that local currency. Therefore, as consumers write checks, use debit cards, or use credit cards, the M1 money supply increases.




Why Is M1 Money Supply So High?
In May 2020, the Federal Reserve changed the official formula for calculating the M1 money supply. Prior to May 2020, M1 included currency in circulation, demand deposits at commercial banks, and other checkable deposits. After May 2020, the definition was expanded to include other liquid deposits, including savings accounts. This change was accompanied by a sharp spike in the reported value of the M1 money supply.




Why Is M2 More Stable Than M1?
The M2 money supply is more stable than the M1 money supply because the M1 money supply only contains the most liquid of assets. Whereas it may take a little longer for components of the M2 money supply to convert or be liquidated, the M1 money supply more often changes due to the ease of being able to transact.




Who Controls the M1 Money Supply?
The total supply of money is managed by the Federal Reserve banks. The Federal Reserve banks establish monetary and fiscal policies to influence the economy, create jobs, or combat inflation.




How Does the M1 Money Supply Affect Inflation?
As the Federal Reserve increases the money supply, money is easier to come by. Debt usually costs less, or tax breaks approved by the Federal government may reduce tax liabilities. As a result, consumers have more capital available to spend. An unfortunate downside of increasing the money supply is that the demand for goods broadly increases as consumers have greater purchasing power. As a result, prices for good broadly tend to increase. For example, when the cost of debt is low and the money supply increases, the cost of taking a home mortgage (i.e. mortgage rates) are low, thus applying upward pressure on housing prices.


   The Bottom Line  

The M1 money supply consists of the sum of currency, demand deposits, and other liquid deposits. Each component is often seasonally adjusted, and this measurement contains only the most liquid vehicles compared to other money supply measurements. The money supply often directly relates to inflation, and the Federal Reserve often manages the money supply via fiscal and monetary policy to influence the economy.



Correction—May 14, 2023: An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that the M0 money supply is equal to the amount of currency in circulation. In fact, M0 also includes the reserve balances held by banks at the Federal Reserve.
What Is M2?  

M2 is the U.S. Federal Reserve's estimate of the total money supply including all of the cash people have on hand plus all of the money deposited in checking accounts, savings accounts, and other short-term saving vehicles such as certificates of deposit (CDs). Retirement account balances and time deposits above $100,000 are omitted from M2.



The Federal Reserve tracks a separate money supply number, called M1, that includes currency that is in people's pockets or in their checking accounts and savings accounts. The money that is deposited in time deposits and money market funds is not counted in M1. For the Fed's purposes, this is "near money." That is, the funds cannot be used as a medium of exchange and they are not instantly convertible to cash.





Key Takeaways

M2 is a measure of the money supply that includes cash, checking deposits, and other types of deposits that are readily convertible to cash such as CDs.M1 is an estimate of cash, checking, and savings account deposits only.The weekly M2 and M1 numbers are closely monitored as indicators of the overall money supply. Too-fast growth in the numbers can be a warning sign of inflation.Another money supply number, M3, includes all of the above plus large institutional cash deposits. The M3 is published quarterly.Gold is not counted in M1, M2, or M3. In the modern world, gold is no longer used as a common currency.


   Understanding M2  

Measuring the money supply of an economy is a challenging proposition. Due to the complexity of the concept of “money,” as well as the size and level of detail of an economy, there are multiple ways of measuring a money supply.



These measures are typically classified as “M”s and fall along a spectrum from narrow to broad monetary aggregates. Typically, the “M”s range from M0 to M3, with M2 typically representing a fairly broad measure.



M2 is a more comprehensive calculation than M1 because it includes assets that are highly liquid but are not intended to be routinely used as cash. Consumers and businesses don't usually use time deposits when making purchases or paying bills, but in a pinch, they could convert them to cash in short order.





M1 and M2 Reporting Times

The Federal Reserve releases M1 and M2 numbers every Thursday at 4:30 p.m. The St. Louis Fed tracks the numbers.



Economists usually use the broader M2 number when discussing the money supply because modern economies often involve transfers between different account types.



For example, a business may periodically transfer $10,000 from a money market account to a checking account. This transfer would increase M1, which doesn’t include money market funds, while keeping M2 stable, since M2 contains both accounts.


   The Money Supply  

M2 is a critical factor in the forecasting of inflation. Inflation and current interest rates have major ramifications for the general economy, as they heavily influence job availability, consumer spending, business investment, currency strength, and trade balances.



In the United States, the Federal Reserve publishes M1 and M2 money supply data every Thursday at 4:30 p.m.



Yet another "M," the M3, includes numbers on large-time deposits, institutional money market funds, and other large liquid assets. This is published on a quarterly basis.


   Changes in Money Supply  

The Federal Reserve's dual mandate is to balance unemployment and inflation. One of the ways it does this is by manipulating the M2 money supply.



The M2 numbers provide important insight into the direction, extremity, and efficacy of central bank policy. A significant change in the measurement of M2 came in May 2020, when savings accounts were moved from M2 to M1.



M2 has consistently been growing. It was $4.7 trillion on Jan. 3, 2000, and was $21.1 trillion on March 6, 2023. The most extreme growth occurred from Feb. 2020 to June 2020 during the Coronavirus pandemic when M2 jumped from $15.3 trillion to $18 trillion. Other large increases have also coincided with economic weakness, during which expansionary monetary policy was deployed by the central bank.




What Is the Value of M2 Now?
The M2 was $21.1 trillion in March 2023. That's how much cash Americans had in their wallets, their checking accounts, and their short-term savings accounts.




What Happens When the M2 Money Supply Increases?
When there is more cash out there, more cash gets spent. A little more can be good. A lot more can increase the risk of inflation. That's why the Federal Reserve constricts the money supply when inflation rears its ugly head. The Fed is slowing down spending in order to control the rate of inflation.




Is M2 a Leading Economic Indicator?
M2 is seen as a reliable predictor of inflation, so it might be counted among the leading economic indicators. M3 is considered by some economists to be an even better predictor of inflation. This is published quarterly rather than monthly and includes data on large liquid assets held by financial institutions.


   The Bottom Line  

The Federal Reserve isn't keeping track of how much cash you've got in your wallet but it's got a pretty good idea of how much cash all of us have on hand at any given time. The important point isn't the number but how the number is increasing or decreasing from month to month. Too much cash is seen as a warning sign of a growing threat of inflation.
What Is M3?  

M3 is a measure of the money supply that includes M2 as well as large time deposits, institutional money market funds, short-term repurchase agreements (repo), and larger liquid assets.



The M3 measurement includes assets that are less liquid than other components of the money supply and are referred to as "near money," which are more closely related to the finances of larger financial institutions and corporations than to those of small businesses and individuals.





Key Takeaways

M3 is a collection of the money supply that includes M2 money as well as large time deposits, institutional money market funds, short-term repurchase agreements, and larger liquid funds.M3 is closely associated with larger financial institutions and corporations than with small businesses and individuals.M3 was traditionally used by economists to estimate the entire money supply within an economy and by governments to direct policy and control inflation over medium and long-term periods.As a measure of money supply, M3 has largely been replaced by money zero maturity (MZM).M3 is still published as a source of economic data, but mostly for ease of historical comparisons.


   Understanding M3  

The money supply, sometimes referred to as the money stock, has many classifications of liquidity. The total money supply includes all of the currency in circulation as well as liquid financial products, such as certificates of deposit (CDs).



The M3 classification is the broadest measure of an economy's money supply. It emphasizes money as a store-of-value more so than as a medium of exchange, hence the inclusion of less-liquid assets in M3. Less-liquid assets would include those that are not easily convertible to cash and therefore not ready to use if needed right away.



M3 was traditionally used by economists to estimate the entire money supply within an economy and by central banks to direct monetary policy in order to control inflation, consumption, growth, and liquidity, over medium and long-term periods.



In order to determine M3, each M3 component is given equal weight during calculation. For example, M2 and large time deposits are treated the same and aggregated without any adjustments. While this does create a simplified calculation, it assumes that each component of M3 affects the economy the same way, which is not the case in the actual economy.



This equal weighting can be considered a shortcoming of the M3 measurement of the money supply, which is why it is no longer used as a true measurement of the money supply any longer.


   Disuse of M3  

Because of its shortcomings, M3 has since been eclipsed by money zero maturity (MZM) as a preferred measure of the money supply. MZM is seen as a better measure of the readily available money in the economy and as a clearer illustration of the expansion and contraction of that supply. MZM does not include money that is not readily available, such as CDs.



Since 2006, M3 is no longer tracked by the U.S. central bank, the Federal Reserve. The Fed did not use M3 in its monetary policy decisions even before 2006. The additional less liquid components of M3 didn't appear to convey more economic information than was already captured by the more liquid components of M2.



However, the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis and some other sources still publish M3 figures for economic data purposes. As of July 2023, M3 for the United States was $20.90 trillion.


   M3 and the Other M Classifications  

M3 can be thought of as a congregation of all the other classifications of money (M0, M1, and M2) plus all of the less liquid components of the money supply.



M0 refers to the currency in circulation, such as coins and cash. M1 includes M0, demand deposits, such as checking accounts, traveler's checks, and currency that is out of circulation but readily available.



M2 includes all of M1 (and all of M0) plus savings deposits and certificates of deposit, which are less liquid than checking accounts. M3 includes all of M2 (and all of M1 and M0) but adds the least liquid components of the money supply that are not in circulation, such as repurchase agreements that do not mature for days or weeks.
What Is M-Pesa?  

M-Pesa is a mobile banking service that allows users to store and transfer money through their mobile phones. M-Pesa was introduced in Kenya as an alternative way for the population of the country to have access to financial services. Safaricom, the largest mobile phone operator in Kenya, launched M-Pesa in 2007. It has been a joint venture of Safaricom and Vodacom since 2020 and serves the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), Egypt, Ghana, Kenya, Lesotho, Mozambique, and Tanzania.






M stands for mobile, and Pesa means money or payment in Swahili.



One of the drives for Fintech innovations like M-Pesa is financial inclusion, which is mostly geared toward underbanked or unbanked people. Financial inclusion seeks solutions for residents who have no access to banks or who can’t afford the required minimum deposits in the digital banking era. In order for this initiative to succeed, different sectors must collaborate in sharing data with each other to build a meaningful digital platform.



This cross-communication tactic used by M-Pesa is developing rapidly in sub-Saharan Africa, where the telecommunication and banking sectors are working together to create mobile banking services for those with limited access to traditional banking.





Key Takeaways


M-Pesa was created through a collaboration of telecommunication and banking sectors in East Africa.
M-Pesa began in Kenya and is being utilized in seven African countries. 
Emergent technology in the financial sector, or Fintech, has made it possible for financial services and products, like M-Pesa, to be more accessible at small costs.
M-Pesa makes it possible for unbanked people to pay for and receive goods and services using a mobile phone instead of utilizing a brick-and-mortar bank.



   Understanding M-Pesa  

M-Pesa is a virtual banking system that provides transaction services through a SIM card. Once the SIM has been inserted into the card slot of the mobile device, users can make payments and transfer money to vendors and family members with SMS messages.



Users with no bank accounts can access the numerous M-Pesa outlets distributed across the country. The money that needs to be stored is given to the kiosk attendant, who transfers the amount in digital form to the user’s M-Pesa’s account.



Cash collected digitally is stored in an M-Pesa trust account. The bank accounts function like regular checking accounts from which bills can be paid, deposits can be received, and more.



M-Pesa provides receipts as proof of transaction. All transactions require a PIN, and both parties receive an SMS notification with the full name of the counterparty and the amount of funds deposited or withdrawn from the user’s account. The mobile receipt, which is received within seconds, helps to promote transparency for all individuals involved in a transaction.


   An Example of M-Pesa  

A farmer with no bank account wants to deposit his commodity sale proceeds of 1,000 shillings to his M-Pesa account. He deposits the money with a kiosk agent or attendant. The agent, in turn, uses their phone to access the client’s account with the client’s registered phone number and credit the account for 1,000 shillings.



The farmer gets an SMS notification within seconds of the deposit, confirming how much was deposited and what his account balance holds. The farmer also can easily withdraw cash from his account by using the M-Pesa attendant's or agent's number provided at the outlet and a personal PIN.


   Special Considerations  

Through mobile payment services like M-Pesa, market traders, debt collectors, farmers, and cab drivers don’t need to carry around or transact in large amounts of cash. This means that the occurrence of theft, robbery, and fraud can be reduced. Also, individuals and business owners don’t have to wait in long lines for hours to make their electricity and water bill payments because these can be made using M-Pesa.






Using M-Pesa allows small business owners in remote and rural areas to conduct financial transactions safely and easily via their mobile phones.



To combat fraud, M-Pesa is regulated by the appropriate offices of each country where it is offered. To register for an M-Pesa account, users must provide a government ID and any other information, such as a home address, required by the government where they live. This way, each transaction is marked with the identification of the party transferring, paying, depositing, or withdrawing money from an account.




Does M-Pesa Work in the U.S.?
M-Pesa does not work in the U.S. It serves seven countries in Africa, including the DRC, Egypt, Ghana, Kenya, Lesotho, Mozambique, and Tanzania.




What Services Are Available on M-Pesa?
M-Pesa allows users to deposit or withdraw cash, accept mobile deposits, pay for goods or services at participating businesses, and more. It functions much like a checking account with the same mobile features offered by standard checking accounts.




What Is an Example of Mobile Money?
Funds that can be transferred electronically sometimes are called mobile money. The funds typically are connected directly to a bank account or they might be in the form of a prepaid gift card or prepaid debit or credit card. Apps like PayPal or Venmo are common examples electronic payment services that function similarly to M-Pesa.


   The Bottom Line  

M-Pesa was designed in 2007 to serve unbanked or underbanked residents of Kenya and since has expanded to serve six other nations in Africa. It functions much like PayPal or other common payment apps except that users of M-Pesa do not need to have a bank account. Through M-Pesa agents located throughout the countries where the service is available, customers can deposit cash in exchange for equivalent funds that are immediately transferred to their electronic account. The opposite also holds true: Customers can transfer electronic funds in exchange for cash.
What Is the Maastricht Treaty?  

The term Maastricht Treaty refers to the international agreement that was responsible for the creation of the European Union (EU). The agreement was signed in 1992 in the Dutch city of Maastricht and became effective in 1993. It led to greater cooperation between the 12 member nations that signed the treaty by promoting unified citizenship, along with economic, social, and progress. The treaty also laid down the foundation for a single currency, the euro. It was amended several times since it was signed. As of October 2021, 27 member states were part of the European Union.





Key Takeaways

The Maastricht Treaty laid down the foundation for the European Union.The treaty was signed by 12 countries in the Dutch city of Maastricht in 1992 and went into effect in 1993.The agreement established greater cooperation between member states through economic, social, and legal channels.The Maastricht Treaty established the European Union's single currency system for the euro.The treaty was amended a number of times between 1997 and 2009.


   Understanding the Maastricht Treaty  

The Maastricht Treaty was signed in the Dutch city of Maastricht on Feb. 7, 1992, by representatives of 12 member nations that made up the European Community (EC). Discussions for the agreement began in December 1991. The concept of the EU was a topic of debate and required the approval of voters in each country, which included:



BelgiumDenmarkFranceGermanyGreeceIrelandItalyLuxembourgNetherlandsPortugalSpainUnited Kingdom and Northern Ireland



Formally as the Treaty on European Union, the treaty went into effect on Nov. 1, 1993.



The goal of the treaty was to increase cooperation by establishing common European citizenship to allow residents to move, live, and work freely between member states. It also created a shared economic, foreign policy, and security policy system. Member nations also agreed to cooperate on security and legal affairs.



The treaty established a timeline for the creation and implementation of the European Economic and Monetary Union (EMU). The EMU was to include a common economic and monetary union, a central banking system, and a common currency. The European Central Bank (ECB) was in 1998 once the end of the year conversion rates between member states' currencies was fixed, a prelude to the creation of the euro, which began circulation in 2002.



It also introduced the criteria that countries must meet if they want to join the euro. This was a measure to ensure that countries joining the euro were stable in inflation, levels of public debt, interest rates, and exchange rates.






Nineteen of the countries use the euro as their official currency.


   Special Considerations  

The treaty was amended a number of times since it was first ratified:



In 1997, the Treaty of Amsterdam added to some of the social protection points in the original treaty, including those referring to asylum seekers and immigration, sex discrimination, and living and working conditions.The Treaty of Nice, which went into effect in February 2003, reformed the Treaty of Maastricht in preparation for new member states. This agreement gave the Commission's president more autonomy from member state governments. It also provided member states with more power to integrate policies in some areas, despite the need for national vetoes.The Treaty of Lisbon amended existing treaties rather than replacing them. It established an EU presidency, strengthened the union's foreign policy representation, and transferred greater power to the union's judiciary, parliament, and commission. It went into effect in December 2009 after two years of votes in member countries.






The United Kingdom voted to leave the European Union following a referendum referred to as Brexit. Its withdrawal formally took place on Jan. 31, 2020.


   Effects of the Maastricht Treaty  

The treaty granted EU citizenship to every citizen of a member state, allowing people to run for local office and for European Parliament elections in the EU country where they lived, regardless of nationality.  



By creating a common economic and monetary union, the agreement established the current central banking system. The ECB's main objective is to maintain price stability, which ultimately means to safeguard the value of the euro. This started with the free movement of capital between the member states, which led to increased cooperation between national central banks and the increased alignment of economic policy among member states. The final step was the introduction of the euro.



A major goal was greater policy cooperation and coordination more generally. The environment, policing, and social policy were just some of a number of areas in which the countries aimed to increase cooperation and coordination.
What Is the Macaulay Duration?  

The Macaulay duration is the weighted average term to maturity of the cash flows from a bond. The weight of each cash flow is determined by dividing the present value of the cash flow by the price. Macaulay duration is frequently used by portfolio managers who use an immunization strategy.



Macaulay duration can be calculated as follows:

   Understanding the Macaulay Duration  

The metric is named after its creator, Frederick Macaulay. Macaulay duration can be viewed as the economic balance point of a group of cash flows. Another way to interpret the statistic is that it is the weighted average number of years that an investor must maintain a position in the bond until the present value of the bond’s cash flows equals the amount paid for the bond.


   Factors Affecting Duration  

A bond’s price, maturity, coupon and yield to maturity all factor into the calculation of duration. All else being equal, duration increases as maturity increases. As a bond’s coupon increases, its duration decreases. As interest rates increase, duration decreases and the bond’s sensitivity to further interest rate increases goes down. Also, a sinking fund in place, a scheduled prepayment before maturity, and call provisions all lower a bond’s duration.


   Calculation Example  

The calculation of Macaulay duration is straightforward. Let’s assume that a $1,000 face-value bond pays a 6% coupon and matures in three years. Interest rates are 6% per annum, with semiannual compounding. The bond pays the coupon twice a year and pays the principal on the final payment. Given this, the following cash flows are expected over the next three years:

With the periods and the cash flows known, a discount factor must be calculated for each period. This is calculated as 1 ÷ (1 + r)n, where r is the interest rate and n is the period number in question. The interest rate, r, compounded semiannually is 6% ÷ 2 = 3%. Therefore, the discount factors would be:

What Is a Macro Environment?  

A macro environment refers to the set of conditions that exist in the economy as a whole, rather than in a particular sector or region. In general, the macro environment includes trends in the gross domestic product (GDP), inflation, employment, spending, and monetary and fiscal policy. The macro-environment is closely linked to the general business cycle as opposed to the performance of an individual business sector.





Key Takeaways

The macro-environment refers to the broader condition of an economy as opposed to specific markets.The macro-environment can be affected by GDP, fiscal policy, monetary policy, inflation, employment rates, and consumer spending.The state of the macro environment affects business decisions on things such as spending, borrowing, and investing.

   Understanding the Macro Environment  

The macro-environment refers to how the macroeconomic conditions in which a company or sector operates influence its performance. Macroeconomics deals with aggregate production, spending, and the price level in an economy as opposed to individual industries and markets.



The amount of the macro environment's influence depends on how much of a company's business is dependent on the health of the overall economy. Cyclical industries are heavily influenced by the macro environment, while basic staple industries are less influenced. Industries that are highly dependent on credit to finance purchases and business investments are strongly influenced by changes in interest rates and global financial markets.



The macro-environment can also directly affect consumers’ ability and willingness to spend. Luxury goods industries and big-ticket consumer goods can be highly impacted by fluctuations in consumer spending. Consumers’ reactions to the broad macro-environment are closely monitored by businesses and economists as a gauge for an economy’s health.






   Factors of the Macro Environment  

Analyzing the macro environment is an important part of strategic management. Business analysts often conduct a PEST (political, economic, socio-cultural, and technological) analysis to identify macro-economic factors that currently affect or in the future may affect business. Some of the key factors composing the macro environment include the following:


  Gross Domestic Product  

Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is a measure of a country’s output and production of goods and services. The Bureau of Economic Analysis releases a quarterly report on GDP growth that provides a broad overview of the output of goods and services across all sectors. An especially influential aspect of GDP is corporate profits for the economy, which is another measure of an economy’s comprehensive productivity.


  Inflation  

Inflation is a key factor watched by economists, investors, and consumers. It affects the purchasing power of the US dollar and is closely watched by the Federal Reserve. The target rate for annual inflation from the Federal Reserve is 2%. Inflation higher than 2% significantly diminishes the purchasing power of the dollar, making each unit less valuable as inflation rises.


  Employment  

Employment levels in the United States are measured by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which releases a monthly report on business payrolls and the status of the unemployment rate. The Federal Reserve also seeks to regulate employment levels through monetary policy stimulus and credit measures. These policies can ease borrowing rates for businesses to help improve capital spending and business growth, resulting in employment growth.


  Consumer Spending  

Consumer spending made up 54% of the U.S. GDP in the second quarter of 2021 and is widely considered to be an important indicator of macroeconomic performance. Slow growth or decline in consumer spending suggests a decline in aggregate demand, which economists consider to be a symptom or even a cause of macroeconomic downturns and recessions. 


  Monetary Policy  

The Federal Reserve’s monetary policy initiatives are a key factor influencing the macro environment in the United States. Monetary policy measures are typically centered around interest rates and access to credit. Federal interest rate limits are one of the main levers of the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy tools. The Federal Reserve sets a federal funds rate for which federal banks borrow from each other, and this rate is used as a base rate for all credit rates in the broader market. The tightening of monetary policy indicates rates are rising, making borrowing more costly and less affordable.


  Fiscal Policy  

Fiscal policy refers to government policy around taxation, borrowing, and spending. High tax rates can reduce individual and business incentives to work, invest, and save. The size of a government’s annual deficits and total debt can influence market expectations regarding future tax rates, inflation, and overall macroeconomic stability. Government spending drives borrowing and taxation; it is also widely used as a policy tool to try to stimulate economic activity during slow times and make up for sluggish, consumer spending and business investment during recessions.




What Are the Differences Between a Micro and Macro Environment?
The micro environment refers to the factors within a company that impact its ability to do business. Micro environmental factors are specific to a company and can influence the operation of a company and management's ability to meet the goals of the business. Examples of these factors include the company's suppliers, resellers, customers, and competition.The micro environment is specific to a business or the immediate location or sector in which it operates. In contrast, the macro environment refers to broader factors that can affect a business. Examples of these factors include demographic, ecological, political, economic, socio-cultural, and technological factors.




What Is Macro Environment Analysis?
Macro environment analysis is part of a company's strategic management that enables it to analyze and identify potential opportunities and hazards that might impact the business. The goal is to prepare management in advance with information that assists them in making operational decisions.Some companies will employ analysts trained to evaluate macro-environmental factors and provide recommendations based on their research. These analysts will review broad macro-environmental forces related to such factors as politics, the economy, demographics, and technology.




What Is an Example of a Macro Environment?
Political factors are an example of a macro-environmental force that can impact a business. These include laws or government regulations governing companies or the industry in which they operate.For example, a government can enact tariffs that increase the cost of an imported good a company needs to manufacture its products. Rather than paying the tariff, the company can look for a domestic source for these goods that is cheaper than the imported good. If they can't find a domestic source, they will have to purchase the more expensive imported goods. In many cases, the company will need to pass the additional cost on to the consumer in the form of increased product prices. This could reduce the company's revenue if sales decrease because of the company's higher prices.
What Is a Macro Manager?  

A macro manager is a type of boss or supervisor who takes a more hands-off approach and lets employees do their jobs with minimal direct supervision. This style of leadership is referred to as macro-management. Macro managers can be thought of by some employees as supervisors who do not give them enough support or feedback to do their jobs effectively, while others may be glad to be trusted and left alone.



A macro manager is the opposite of a micromanager, a supervisor who constantly looks over employees' shoulders and is often perceived as controlling and overly critical.





Key Takeaways

A macro manager is a hands-off boss who trusts his or her employees to do their jobs as they see best.Macro managers are more concerned with overall plans and results than individual styles or day-to-day habits.Adopting a macro-management leadership style can include delegating authority and responsibilities, while the manager focuses their attention on developing and executing the overall strategy for the team.Macro managers can be accused of being aloof and out of touch with daily issues.A macro manager is the opposite of a micromanager, a supervisor who constantly looks over employees' shoulders and is often perceived as controlling and overly critical.


   Understanding Macro Managers  

In managing a firm and its employees, different management styles come into play. Micromanagement and macro managers take a birds-eye-view approach, with top-down management decisions that weigh aggregated metrics and aggregate performance. Adopting a macro-management leadership style can include delegating authority and responsibilities, while the manager focuses their attention on developing and executing the overall strategy for the team.



The term "macro manager" can also describe someone who runs a global macro hedge fund. Global macro managers need to have a broad knowledge base to understand big-picture influences on investment performance in the global marketplace. Such influences include political events, government policies, and the way different countries' central banks function. George Soros, Julian Robertson, and Michael Steinhardt are well-known global macro managers.


   Advantages and Disadvantages of Macro Managers  

Macro management may be seen as beneficial and suitable for the upper tiers of an organization’s hierarchy, as it grants employees room to act with more autonomy. For example, an executive leader of a division within an organization may task the staff who works under them to adhere to an overall strategic plan but make their own decisions on how best to execute that strategy. Likewise, the president of a company may present broad ideas to the executive team they lead and rely on their individual expertise to take action rather than give them orders that cover the minutest details.



There can be drawbacks to working with a macro manager. They may be distant and not directly informed about the day-to-day issues the team faces. It can take time before they are made aware of problems or challenges the team must deal with.



Furthermore, a macro manager could be seen as little more as than an extra layer of bureaucracy, with limited activity interest in the tasks at hand. Their minimal direct involvement with subordinates can be regarded as a lack of awareness or understanding of the work each employee is asked to perform. This can affect the team’s ability to achieve milestones and meet deadlines if the manager is not fully aware of obstacles that may impede the team’s ability to take action.
What Is a Macroeconomic Factor?  

A macroeconomic factor is an influential fiscal, natural, or geopolitical event that broadly affects a regional or national economy. Macroeconomic factors tend to impact wide swaths of populations, rather than just a few select individuals. Examples of macroeconomic factors include economic outputs, unemployment rates, and inflation. These indicators of economic performance are closely monitored by governments, businesses, and consumers alike.





Key Takeaways

A macroeconomic factor is an influential fiscal, natural, or geopolitical event that broadly affects a regional or national economy.The relationships between various macroeconomic factors are extensively studied in the field of macroeconomics.Examples of macroeconomic factors include economic outputs, unemployment rates, and inflation.Macroeconomic factors can be positive, negative, or neutral.


   Understanding Macroeconomic Factors  

The relationships between various macroeconomic factors are extensively studied in the field of macroeconomics. While macroeconomics concerns the broad economy as a whole, microeconomics narrows its realm of study to individual agents, such as consumers and businesses, and their respective economic behaviors and decision-making patterns.



A macroeconomic factor may include anything that influences the direction of a particular large-scale market. For example, fiscal policy and various regulations can impact state and national economies, while potentially triggering broader international implications. 


   Negative Macroeconomic Factors  

Negative macroeconomic factors include events that may jeopardize national or international economies. Fears of political instability caused by a nation’s involvement in a civil or international war are likely to heighten economic turbulence, due to the reallocation of resources, or damage to property, assets, and livelihoods.



Unanticipated catastrophic events, such as the 2008 United States economic crisis, subsequently created a far-reaching ripple effect, resulting in tighter capital preservation requirements for banking institutions on a global scale. Other negative macroeconomic factors include natural disasters, such as earthquakes, tornadoes, flooding, and brushfires.



The COVID-19 pandemic is another example of a negative macroeconomic factor. Lockdowns triggered mass unemployment, hefty government spending, and supply shutdowns and later contributed to rapid inflation.






Diseases, such as COVID-19 and the 2014 Ebola virus, can also be defined as macroeconomic factors.


   Neutral Macroeconomic Factors  

Certain economic shifts are neither positive nor negative. Rather, the precise implications are determined by the intent of the action, such as trade regulation across state or national borders. The nature of the action in question, such as enacting or rescinding a trade embargo, will trigger myriad effects, depending on the economy being influenced.


   Positive Macroeconomic Factors  

Positive macroeconomic factors include events that subsequently foster prosperity and economic growth within a single nation or a group of nations.



For example, a decrease in fuel prices within the U.S. might drive consumers to purchase more retail goods and services. Moreover, as the demand for goods and services increases, national and international suppliers of those items will invariably enjoy increased revenues from the heightened consumer activity. In turn, increased profits may drive up stock prices.


   Macroeconomic Factor Cycle  

Economies are often cyclic at the macroeconomic level. As positive influences promote prosperity, increased demand may trigger higher prices, which may, in turn, suppress the economy, as households restrict their spending. As supply begins to outweigh demand, prices may again dip, leading to further prosperity, until the next shift in economic supply and demand.




What Are Some Examples of Macroeconomic Factors?
Macroeconomic factors include inflation, fiscal policy, employment levels, national income, and international trade.




What Is the Difference Between Macroeconomics and Microeconomics?
Macroeconomics concerns the broad economy as a whole, whereas microeconomics narrows down its focus to the study of individual agents, such as consumers and businesses, and the impact of their behavior and decision-making. Microeconomics seeks to explain things such as how and why different goods have different values, and how individuals can best maximize efficiency.




How Do Macroeconomic Factors Affect a Business?
Macroeconomic factors impact the whole population, including businesses. Cyclical companies, in particular, are likely to be more affected by macroeconomic factors as their fate is more closely tied to the state of the economy.


   The Bottom Line  

Macroeconomic factors are important and hard to ignore, impacting economies and the state of our personal finances.



Governments try to manage these factors and maintain stability. However, the economy still moves through boom and bust cycles and it generally pays to keep on top of this and be aware of what is going on to best protect and enhance your finances.
What Is Macroeconomics?  

Macroeconomics is a branch of economics that studies how an overall economy—the markets, businesses, consumers, and governments—behave. Macroeconomics examines economy-wide phenomena such as inflation, price levels, rate of economic growth, national income, gross domestic product (GDP), and changes in unemployment.



Some of the key questions addressed by macroeconomics include: What causes unemployment? What causes inflation? What creates or stimulates economic growth? Macroeconomics attempts to measure how well an economy is performing, understand what forces drive it, and project how performance can improve.





Key Takeaways

Macroeconomics is the branch of economics that deals with the structure, performance, behavior, and decision-making of the whole, or aggregate, economy.The two main areas of macroeconomic research are long-term economic growth and shorter-term business cycles.Macroeconomics in its modern form is often defined as starting with John Maynard Keynes and his theories about market behavior and governmental policies in the 1930s; several schools of thought have developed since.In contrast to macroeconomics, microeconomics is more focused on the influences on and choices made by individual actors in the economy (people, companies, industries, etc.).

   Understanding Macroeconomics  

As the term implies, macroeconomics is a field of study that analyzes an economy through a wide lens. This includes looking at variables like unemployment, GDP, and inflation. In addition, macroeconomists develop models explaining the relationships between these factors.



These models, and the forecasts they produce, are used by government entities to aid in constructing and evaluating economic, monetary, and fiscal policy. Businesses use the models to set strategies in domestic and global markets, and investors use them to predict and plan for movements in various asset classes.



Properly applied, economic theories can illuminate how economies function and the long-term consequences of particular policies and decisions. Macroeconomic theory can also help individual businesses and investors make better decisions through a more thorough understanding of the effects of broad economic trends and policies on their own industries.


   History of Macroeconomics  

While the term "macroeconomics" is not all that old (going back to the 1940s), many of macroeconomics's core concepts have been the study focus for much longer. Topics like unemployment, prices, growth, and trade have concerned economists since the beginning of the discipline in the 1700s. Elements of earlier work from Adam Smith and John Stuart Mill addressed issues that would now be recognized as the domain of macroeconomics.



In its modern form, macroeconomics is often defined as starting with John Maynard Keynes and his book The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money in 1936. Keynes explained the fallout from the Great Depression when goods remained unsold, and workers were unemployed.






Throughout the 20th century, Keynesian economics, as Keynes' theories became known, diverged into several other schools of thought.



Before the popularization of Keynes' theories, economists did not generally differentiate between micro- and macroeconomics. The same microeconomic laws of supply and demand that operate in individual goods markets were understood to interact between individual markets to bring the economy into a general equilibrium, as described by Leon Walras.



The link between goods markets and large-scale financial variables such as price levels and interest rates was explained through the unique role that money plays in the economy as a medium of exchange by economists such as Knut Wicksell, Irving Fisher, and Ludwig von Mises.


   Macroeconomics vs. Microeconomics  

Macroeconomics differs from microeconomics, which focuses on smaller factors that affect choices made by individuals and companies. Factors studied in both microeconomics and macroeconomics typically influence one another.



A key distinction between micro- and macroeconomics is that macroeconomic aggregates can sometimes behave in very different ways or even the opposite of similar microeconomic variables. For example, Keynes referenced the so-called Paradox of Thrift, which argues that individuals save money to build wealth (micro). However, when everyone tries to increase their savings at once, it can contribute to a slowdown in the economy and less wealth in the aggregate (macro). This is because there would be a reduction in spending, affecting business revenues and lowering worker pay.



Meanwhile, microeconomics looks at economic tendencies, or what can happen when individuals make certain choices. Individuals are typically classified into subgroups, such as buyers, sellers, and business owners. These actors interact with each other according to the laws of supply and demand for resources, using money and interest rates as pricing mechanisms for coordination.


   Limits of Macroeconomics  

It is also important to understand the limitations of economic theory. Theories are often created in a vacuum and lack specific real-world details like taxation, regulation, and transaction costs. The real world is also decidedly complicated and includes matters of social preference and conscience that do not lend themselves to mathematical analysis.






It is common in economics to find the phrase ceterus paribus, loosely translated as "all else being equal," in economic theories and discussions. This is because there are so many variables that economists use this phrase as an assumption to focus on the relationships between the variables being discussed.



Even with the limits of economic theory, it is important and worthwhile to follow significant macroeconomic indicators like GDP, inflation, and unemployment. This is because the performance of companies, and by extension their stocks, is significantly influenced by the economic conditions in which the companies operate.



Likewise, it can be invaluable to understand which theories are in favor and influencing a particular government administration. The underlying economic principles of a government will say much about how that government will approach taxation, regulation, government spending, and similar policies. By better understanding economics and the ramifications of economic decisions, investors can get at least a glimpse of the probable future and act accordingly with confidence.


   Macroeconomic Schools of Thought  

The field of macroeconomics is organized into many different schools of thought, with differing views on how the markets and their participants operate.


  Classical  

Classical economists held that prices, wages, and rates are flexible and markets tend to clear unless prevented from doing so by government policy, building on Adam Smith's original theories. The term “classical economists” is not actually a school of macroeconomic thought but a label applied first by Karl Marx and later by Keynes to denote previous economic thinkers with whom they respectively disagreed.


  Keynesian  

Keynesian economics was founded mainly based on the works of John Maynard Keynes and was the beginning of macroeconomics as a separate area of study from microeconomics. Keynesians focus on aggregate demand as the principal factor in issues like unemployment and the business cycle.



Keynesian economists believe that the business cycle can be managed by active government intervention through fiscal policy, where governments spend more in recessions to stimulate demand or spend less in expansions to decrease it. They also believe in monetary policy, where a central bank stimulates lending with lower rates or restricts it with higher ones.



Keynesian economists also believe that certain rigidities in the system, particularly sticky prices, prevent the proper clearing of supply and demand.


  Monetarist  

The Monetarist school is a branch of Keynesian economics credited mainly to the works of Milton Friedman. Working within and extending Keynesian models, Monetarists argue that monetary policy is generally a more effective and desirable policy tool to manage aggregate demand than fiscal policy. However, monetarists also acknowledge limits to monetary policy that make fine-tuning the economy ill-advised and instead tend to prefer adherence to policy rules that promote stable inflation rates.


  New Classical  

The New Classical school, along with the New Keynesians, is mainly built on integrating microeconomic foundations into macroeconomics to resolve the glaring theoretical contradictions between the two subjects.



The New Classical school emphasizes the importance of microeconomics and models based on that behavior. New Classical economists assume that all agents try to maximize their utility and have rational expectations, which they incorporate into macroeconomic models. New Classical economists believe that unemployment is largely voluntary and that discretionary fiscal policy destabilizes, while inflation can be controlled with monetary policy.


  New Keynesian  

The New Keynesian school also attempts to add microeconomic foundations to traditional Keynesian economic theories. While New Keynesians accept that households and firms operate based on rational expectations, they still maintain that there are a variety of market failures, including sticky prices and wages. Because of this "stickiness," the government can improve macroeconomic conditions through fiscal and monetary policy.


  Austrian  

The Austrian School is an older school of economics that is seeing some resurgence in popularity. Austrian economic theories mainly apply to microeconomic phenomena. However, they, like the so-called classical economists, never strictly separated micro- and macroeconomics.



Austrian theories also have important implications for what is otherwise considered macroeconomic subjects. In particular, the Austrian business cycle theory explains broadly synchronized (macroeconomic) swings in economic activity across markets due to monetary policy and the role that money and banking play in linking (microeconomic) markets to each other and across time. 


   Macroeconomic Indicators  

Macroeconomics is a rather broad field, but two specific research areas represent this discipline. The first area is the factors that determine long-term economic growth, or increases in the national income. The other involves the causes and consequences of short-term fluctuations in national income and employment, also known as the business cycle.


  Economic Growth  

Economic growth refers to an increase in aggregate production in an economy. Macroeconomists try to understand the factors that either promote or retard economic growth to support economic policies that will support development, progress, and rising living standards.



Economists can use many indicators to measure economic performance. These indicators fall into 10 categories:



Gross Domestic Product indicators: Measure how much the economy producesConsumer Spending indicators: Measure how much capital consumers feed back into the economyIncome and Savings indicators: Measures how much consumers make and saveIndustry Performance indicators: Measures GDP by industryInternational Trade and Investment indicators: Indicates the balance of payments between trade partners, how much is traded, and how much is invested internationallyPrices and Inflation indicators: Indicate fluctuations in prices paid for goods and services and changes in currency purchasing powerInvestment in Fixed Assets indicators: Indicate how much capital is tied up in fixed assetsEmployment indicators: Shows employment by industry, state, county, and other areasGovernment indicators: Shows how much the government spends and receivesSpecial indicators: All other economic indicators, such as distribution of personal income, global value chains, healthcare spending, small business well-being, and more


  The Business Cycle  

Superimposed over long-term macroeconomic growth trends, the levels and rates of change of significant macroeconomic variables such as employment and national output go through fluctuations. These fluctuations are called expansions, peaks, recessions, and troughs—they also occur in that order. When charted on a graph, these fluctuations show that businesses perform in cycles; thus, it is called the business cycle.



The National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) measures the business cycle, which uses GDP and Gross National Income to date the cycle. The NBER is also the agency that declares the beginning and end of recessions and expansions.


   How to Influence Macroeconomics  

Because macroeconomics is such a broad area, positively influencing the economy is challenging and takes much longer than changing the individual behaviors within microeconomics. Therefore, economies need to have an entity dedicated to researching and identifying techniques that can influence large-scale changes.



In the U.S., the Federal Reserve is the central bank with a mandate of promoting maximum employment and price stability. These two factors have been identified as essential to positively influencing change at the macroeconomic level.



To influence change, the Fed implements monetary policy through tools it has developed over the years, which work to affect its dual mandates. It has the following tools it can use:



Federal Funds Rate Range: A target range set by the Fed that guides interest rates on overnight lending between depository institutions to boost short-term borrowingOpen Market Operations: Purchase and sell securities on the open market to change the supply of reservesDiscount Window and Rate: Lending to depository institutions to help banks manage liquidityReserve Requirements: Maintaining a reserve to help banks maintain liquidity—reduced to 0% in 2020Interest on Reserve Balances: Encourages banks to hold reserves for liquidity and pays them interest for doing soOvernight Repurchase Agreement Facility: A supplementary tool used to help control the federal funds rate by selling securities and repurchasing them the next day at a more favorable rateTerm Deposit Facility: Reserve deposits with a term, used to drain reserves from the banking systemCentral Bank Liquidity Swaps: Established swap lines for central banks from select countries to improve liquidity conditions in the U.S. and participating countries' central banksForeign and International Monetary Authorities Repo Facility: A facility for institutions to enter repurchase agreements with the Fed to act as a backstop for liquidityStanding Overnight Repurchase Agreement Facility: A facility to encourage or discourage borrowing above a set rate, which helps to control the effective federal funds rate.



The Fed continuously updates the tools it uses to influence the economy, so it has a list of 14 other previously used tools it can implement again if needed.




What Is Macroeconomics in Economics?
Macroeconomics is the field of study of the way a overall economy behaves.




What are the 3 Major Concerns of Macroeconomics?
Three major macroeconomic concerns are the unemployment level, inflation, and economic growth.




Why Is Macroeconics Important?
Macroeconomics helps a government evaluate how an economy is performing and decide on actions it can take to increase or slow growth.


   The Bottom Line  

Macroeconomics is a field of study used to evaluate performance and develop actions that can positively affect an economy. Economists work to understand how specific factors and actions affect output, input, spending, consumption, inflation, and employment.



The study of economics began long ago, but the field didn't start evolving into its current form until the 1700s. Macroeconomics now plays a large part in government and business decision-making.
What Is Magic Formula Investing?  

Magic formula investing refers to a rules-based, disciplined investing strategy that teaches people a relatively simple and easy-to-understand method for value investing. It relies on quantitative screens of companies and stocks, and is designed to beat the stock market's average annual returns using the S&P 500 to represent the market return. Put simply, it works by ranking stocks based on their price and returns on capital.



Magic formula investing tells you how to approach value investing from a methodical and unemotional perspective. Developed by Joel Greenblatt—an investor, hedge fund manager, and business professor—the formula applies to large-cap stocks but doesn't include any small or micro-cap companies.





Key Takeaways

Magic formula investing is a successfully back-tested strategy that can increase your chances of outperforming the market.The strategy focuses on screening for companies that fit specific criteria and uses a methodical, unemotional process to manage the portfolio over time.The strategy, which is value-based, was developed by investor and hedge fund manager Joel Greenblatt and published in The Little Book That Beat the Market in 2005. It was updated in 2010 as The Little Book That Still Beats the Market.In the original publication, Greenblatt claimed annualized returns of over 30%.The magic formula excludes certain types of companies, such as those with a small market capitalization, foreign companies, finance companies, and utilities.


   Understanding Magic Formula Investing  

The magic formula strategy was first described in the 2005 best-selling book The Little Book That Beats the Market and in the 2010 follow-up, The Little Book That Still Beats the Market by investor Joel Greenblatt. Greenblatt, founder and former fund manager at Gotham Asset Management, is a graduate of the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania. He is an adjunct professor at Columbia University's business school.



In the book, Greenblatt outlines two criteria for stock investing: Stock price and company cost of capital. Instead of conducting fundamental analysis of companies and stocks, investors use Greenblatt's online stock screener tool to select the 30 to 50 top-ranked companies in which to invest. Company rankings are based on:



Their stock's earnings which are calculated as earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT).
Their yield, calculated as earnings per share (EPS) divided by the current stock price.
Their return on capital measures how efficiently they generate earnings from their assets.



Investors who use the strategy sell the losing stocks before they have held them for one year to take advantage of the income tax provision that allows investors to use losses to offset their gains. They sell the winning stocks after the one-year mark, in order to take advantage of reduced income tax rates on long-term capital gains. Then they start the process all over again.



As Greenblatt stated in a 2006 interview with Barron's, the magic formula is designed to help investors with “buying good companies, on average, at cheap prices, on average.” Using this straightforward, non-emotional approach, investors screen for companies that are good prospects from a value investing perspective.






Magic formula investing only factors in large cap stocks and doesn't include small cap companies.


   Requirements for Magic Formula Investing  

Since Greenblatt’s magic formula only applies to companies with market capitalizations greater than $50 million, it excludes small-cap stocks. The remainder will all be large companies but excludes financial companies, utility companies, and non-U.S. companies.



The following points outline how the formula works:



Set a minimum market capitalization for your portfolio companies. This should be typically higher than $100 million.
Ensure you exclude any financial or utility stocks when you choose your companies.
Exclude American Depository Receipts (ADRs). These are stocks in foreign companies.
Calculate each company's earnings yield (EBIT ÷ Enterprise Value).
Calculate each company's return on capital [EBIT ÷ (Net Fixed Assets + Working Capital)].
Rank selected companies by highest earnings yields and highest return on capital.
Buy two to three positions each month in the top 20 to 30 companies, over the course of a year.
Each year, rebalance the portfolio by selling off losers one week before the year term ends. Sell off winners one week after the year mark.
Repeat the process each year for a minimum of five to 10 years or more.



According to Greenblatt, his magic formula investing strategy has generated annual returns of 30%. Though they differ in their calculation of returns from the strategy, a number of independent researchers have found that the magical formula investing approach has appeared to show good results when backtested compared to the S&P 500.


   Advantages and Disadvantages of Magic Formula Investing  

The main advantage of the magic formula method is its simplicity: you don't need to be a trained investment specialist or Wall Street prodigy to invest effectively. All it takes is a few simple rules to find a basket of reliable investments. It also reduces emotional or irrational decision-making.



However, contrary to its name, there's nothing magical about the magic formula, and it may not always be the best strategy. Some market tests of the formula have found lower-than-expected returns, possibly due to changing market dynamics or the increased number of investors following Greenblatt's method. In addition, some analysts claim to have improved the method by introducing additional variables, such as debt/equity ratios or dividend yields.




Magic Formula Investing Pros and Cons

Pros

Simple, easy-to-follow rules suitable for every investor.
Facilitates rational, numbers-based investing without emotion or stress.
Shows better-than-market returns in multiple backtests.



Cons

Returns do not always match the high figures which Greenblatt achieved.
Some analysts believe the method can be improved by introducing new variables, or rebalancing more frequently.







What Does Magic Formula Mean?
Magic formula investing refers to a rules-based investing strategy that allows ordinary people to identify undervalued or outperforming companies. It was first described by Joel Greenblatt in The Little Book That Beat the Market in 2005.




How Do You Use Magic Formula Investing?
Magic formula investing uses a set of quantitative screens to eliminate certain companies, and ranks the remainder in order of highest yield and returns. By slowly building and rebalancing the portfolio every year, it is possible to achieve reasonably high returns.




How Do You Calculate Magic Formula?
The key metrics for investing with the magic formula method are the earnings yield and return on capital. Earnings yield is determined by dividing each company's earnings before interest and taxes by the total value of the enterprise. Return on capital is determined by dividing the company's EBIT by the sum of its net fixed assets and working capital.




Does Magic Formula Investing Work?
The magic formula can no longer boast returns of a 30% compound annual growth rate, but some studies nonetheless show favorable results. A backtest of market performance between 2003 and 2015 found that the magic formula strategy had annualized returns of 11.4%, compared with 8.7% from the S&P500. "This is clearly an outperformance of the benchmark," wrote the author of the backtest, "but by nowhere near as much as the Little Book claims."


   The Bottom Line  

The magic formula is a simple, rules-based system designed to bring high returns within reach of the average investor. By following a simple, algorithmic approach, the magic formula allows investors to easily identify outperforming or undervalued companies, without letting emotions or instinct cloud their judgment. While returns are now far lower than when the magic formula was first published, the method can still beat the market, especially with a few modifications.



Correction—Feb, 1, 2023: A previous version of this article incorrectly stated the market capitalization and the number of companies investors can select in Greenblatt’s online stock screener. It has been edited to reflect that the market capitalization starts at $50 million and investors can select 30 to 50 companies.
What Is Magna Cum Laude?  

Magna cum laude is an academic honorific used by educational institutions to signify that an academic degree was earned with notable distinction. Magna cum laude is a Latin phrase that translates into English as “with great praise” and is one of three commonly used academic degree honors—the others being summa cum laude, meaning “with highest distinction,” and cum laude, meaning “with distinction.”



There is no set standard to qualify for these honors, with each school free to set its own criteria. In the United States, magna cum laude is usually achieved by either obtaining a certain grade point average (GPA) or being in the top x% of a graduating class.





Key Takeaways

Magna cum laude is an academic honorific awarded to students who have achieved academic excellence.There is no set standard to qualify for this honor, with each school free to set its own criteria.Many colleges award magna cum laude honors in addition to summa cum laude honors, which are above magna cum laude, and cum laude honors, which are just below.The practice of awarding Latin honors began at Harvard University in the mid-19th century and has spread to colleges and universities around the world.Some colleges, including Stanford University, do not offer Latin honors at all and instead use the word “distinction” to honor students who have achieved academic excellence.

   Understanding Magna Cum Laude  

Magna cum laude means “with great praise” and is awarded to students who have achieved academic excellence. It is more prestigious than cum laude honors but less prestigious than summa cum laude.



The criteria by which each of these distinctions is achieved depends on the specific requirements of each institution. The awarding of Latin honors—the titles are referred to as Latin honors because they retain their original Latin forms—is common in colleges and universities in the United States, although not all bestow them. Many high schools also grant Latin honors.



Latin honors are most commonly awarded in conjunction with a bachelor’s degree. Students who graduate with honors may wear stoles of a distinct color or some other designation during commencement ceremonies, and their honors may be cited when their names are read. Latin honors are generally included in a student’s official transcript.


   Magna Cum Laude Requirements  

Magna cum laude is generally handed out to a student who earned high grades or some other mark of academic achievement, but not the highest possible. The criteria for receiving this honor varies and may include the student’s GPA, class rank, number of hours completed, and recommendations from an academic department.






Some colleges base their GPA requirements for Latin honors on a percentage of the graduating class, meaning that they change every year.


  What GPA Earns a Magna Cum Laude? Real-World Examples  

The academic thresholds for honors differ among academic institutions and even among programs at the same institution. Texas A&M graduates, for instance, must complete 60 credit hours while earning a GPA of 3.70 to 3.899 to earn their degree magna cum laude.



At some universities, the GPA requirements for Latin honors change every academic year because they are based on a percentage of the student’s class. For example, for a student to graduate magna cum laude in engineering from the University of California, Los Angeles, they must finish in the top 5% to 10% of their class after completing 90 credits. For the 2022–2023 academic year, students would need to achieve a grade point average of 3.898; for 2023-2024, the require GPA is 3.934.



By contrast, at Harvard University, where Latin honors originated in the mid-19th century, undergraduates completing degrees with an overall GPA in the top 20% of all graduates will receive either summa cum laude or magna cum laude distinction, with the summa honorific reserved for students with the highest GPAs.



Brown University, on the other hand, does not use a student’s GPA in its calculation. Students are eligible for just one Latin honor, magna cum laude, upon graduation. A student achieves the honor by earning a high percentage of A grades and S for distinction marks for courses. No more than 20% of a graduating class can earn magna cum laude honors.


  Non-GPA Factors  

Colleges may consider other non-GPA factors in their decisions to grant magna cum laude status. An institution might require that students complete an honors thesis to be eligible. Others seek letters of recommendation from faculty members, attesting to students’ exceptional academic performance. Others stipulate that students must complete a certain number of advanced courses.


   Schools With No Magna Cum Laude  

Some colleges, including Stanford University, do not offer Latin honors at all. Stanford bestows a single “with distinction” title on the 15% of students with the highest GPA in each graduating class.






Some schools have substituted other titles, such as “with distinction,” in place of or in addition to the traditional Latin terms.


   The Value of a Magna Cum Laude Degree  

The relative value of a magna cum laude degree or one with another Latin honor is difficult to judge in the context of a job application. It may mean a great deal to some employers and nothing to others. Nonetheless, as new college graduates compete for jobs, having a Latin honor on their diploma or resume certainly doesn’t hurt.



It may be of greater benefit when students compete for slots in graduate school. The top law schools, for example, expect students to have achieved certain GPAs as undergraduates—the type of high marks that are often accompanied by Latin honors.




What Grades Do You Need for Magna Cum Laude?
The academic thresholds for magna cum laude status differ among academic institutions. For example, at the University of Pennsylvania, a GPA of 3.6 is required to graduate magna cum laude, while at Ohio State University’s College of Arts and Sciences, the bar is set at 3.7. Requirements are also subject to change and may differ among programs at the same institution.Grade point average (GPA) isn’t necessarily the only factor taken into consideration. Colleges can look at other things, such as the number of hours completed and recommendations from an academic department. Some may ignore GPA and simply award Latin honors to the highest-ranked students in a class.




Is Magna Cum Laude the Highest?
No. In schools where Latin honors are used, the highest distinction is usually summa cum laude, followed by magna cum laude, and then cum laude.




Which Is Higher: Summa Cum Laude or Magna Cum Laude?
Summa cum laude is the highest honor available and is more prestigious than magna cum laude. For example, at New York University, summa cum laude is awarded to the top 5% of graduates, while the next 10% are given magna cum laude status.


   The Bottom Line  

Getting a degree is always a great achievement, although the job market can be so saturated with new graduates seeking employment that sometimes acquiring a certificate that you passed your courses is not enough. Graduates often need something extra to stand out, and Latin honors such as magna cum laude can help tick that box and potentially be the difference between getting called in for a job interview or not.
Magnetic Ink Character Recognition (MICR) Line  

Magnetic ink character recognition (MICR) is a technology used primarily to identify and process checks. The MICR on a check is the string of characters that appears at the bottom left of the check. It consists of three groups of numbers, including the bank routing number, the customer's account number, and the check number.



The MICR includes, from left, a nine-character routing number, a 12-character account number, and a four-character check number.



It is called a magnetic ink character recognition line in reference to the print technology that is used to enable a machine to read, process, and record information.





Key Takeaways

Magnetic ink character recognition is the string of characters at the bottom left of a personal check that includes the account, routing, and check numbers.MICR numbers are designed to be readable by both individuals and sorting equipment. They can't be faked or copied, due to the use of magnetic ink and unique fonts.The benefits of the technology include enhanced security against fraud and mechanization of check processing.MICR was developed in the late 1950s and is now in use globally.


   How the Magnetic Ink Character Recognition (MICR) Line Works  

The magnetic ink character recognition line enables a computer to rapidly read and record numbers or other information from printed documents, such as a personal check. In this case, that information is a check number, routing number, and account number.



The system was developed by the American Bankers Association (ABA) in the late 1950s and was later recognized as an industry standard by the American National Standards Institute.



The MICR number, which is sometimes confused with just the account number, is printed on the check using magnetic ink or toner, less than an inch above the bottom of the document. The magnetic ink allows a computer to read the characters even if they have been covered with signatures, cancellation marks, bank stamps, or other marks.



MICR lines help facilitate automatic check-clearing when banks send their checks to central processing systems at the end of the day. They are designed to be easily read by people as well, so that check information can be communicated easily.



The numbers are usually printed in one of two specially-designed fonts, called E-13B and CMC-7. Both are used worldwide, with the E-13B used primarily in North America, Australia, and the United Kingdom. The CMC-7 font is mainly used in Europe and parts of South America.


   MICR Check Scanner  

Every check sent is processed by a clearinghouse or a bank, or both. They validate the check and finalize the transaction, deducting the correct amount from one account and crediting it to another. A single check may be processed several times at different banks and Federal Reserve Centers.



Part of that process is reading the identifying information on the check. The MICR line mechanized that process. A scanner, or reader-sorter computerized machine, is used to process the information magnetically printed on the checks, including routing number, account number, and check number.



During the clearing process, a check may be read several times at extremely high speeds. A single reading takes less than 1/1000ths of a second, according to Troy Group, a producer of MICR-adapted printers and related products.






MICR is the reason why checks are so uniform in their format. The layout of the check and the position of the data on it must be rigidly placed so that it can be read by the machines.


   Special Considerations  

While magnetic ink character recognition was first used to print information on checks, the technology has been adapted to other applications.



A variety of financial documents in the United States are encoded with MICR technology. Credit card invoices, direct mail, coupons used for rebates, and negotiable orders of withdrawal (NOWs) may also use the technology.


   Benefits of the MICR Line   

One of the benefits of the magnetic ink character recognition line is its ability to facilitate the use of a routing number to process checks and deduct the payment amounts. A routing number or routing transit number is a nine-digit numerical code which banking and other financial institutions use to clear funds and process checks.



The routing number identifies the bank branch that holds the account from which funds are to be drawn. Wire transfers and direct deposits often rely on routing numbers as well.


  Detecting Fraud  

Combating fraud is a constant battle in the financial services industry. The definition of fraud is an intentionally deceptive action that is designed to provide the perpetrator with an unlawful gain. A range of fraud types exists, including tax fraud, credit card fraud, wire fraud, securities fraud, and bankruptcy fraud.



The magnetic ink character recognition line makes some forms of financial fraud difficult by using tamper-proof magnetic ink and unique fonts. Thus, MICR makes it difficult to alter checks.



Check altering generally entails changing the name of the payee or the amount of the check, or both. Section 3-407 of the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), a set of business laws that regulate financial contracts, breaks down the term alteration even further, with nine articles dealing with separate aspects of banking and loans.



For instance, a fraudster may attempt to cash a photocopied check through a teller at a bank branch. The photocopied MICR line immediately alerts the teller that the check is fake.



Since MICR technology helps detect and prevent fraud, banks and other financial institutions use it to minimize losses.






The routing number, account number, and check number combine to create a unique identifier for each check.


   Frequently Asked Questions  


What Is a MICR Number?
A magnetic ink character recognition line (MICR) is a line of characters on a check printed with a unique ink that allows the characters to be read by a reader-sorter machine. Introduction of the MICR reader-sorter process allowed check processing to be automated while making it more difficult to counterfeit checks.




How Is MICR Used in Banks?
The MICR system has been in use since the late 1950s. It was a notable improvement because it allowed for the mechanization of check processing while making it more difficult to commit check fraud. Banks around the globe adopted the system.This is why the format of bank checks is so uniform. It has to be in order for the readers to read the MICR numbers.




What Is MICR Data on a Check?
The string of characters at the bottom left of a check identifies the bank branch that it is issued from, the account number of the payer, and the number of the account holder's check in a consecutive series.From left, the line displays the following information:The nine-character routing number that identifies the bank branchThe 12-character account number that identifies the payerThe four-character check number that indicates which check in a series that the account holder has used.It looks like this: 000000000 000000000000 0000


   The Bottom Line  

Magnetic ink character recognition is still around some 70 years after it was developed because it solved two big problems faced by banks: The processing of checks had to be mechanized, and fraud had to be made more difficult.



Its three components, including a routing number, an account number, and a check number, together are a unique identifier of a check and the person who signed it. Just as importantly, it is printed using a special ink and custom fonts that make fakes difficult if not impossible to create.
What Is Main Street?  

Main Street is a colloquial term used by economists to refer collectively to America's independent small businesses. It gets its name from a common name for the principal commercial street of small towns across the country. In England, the equivalent term is High Street.



In another context, the term Wall Street versus Main Street, with the former referring to big business and high finance. Nevertheless, those involved in big business and high finance spend a considerable amount of time trying to understand what products, fashions, brands, and trends succeed or fail on Main Street.



More generally, the term Main Street has been used to refer to small-town American traditions or historic business districts. In the finance world, the time Main Street is used to describe small and mid-sized businesses as part of a local economy.





Key Takeaways

The term Main Street is used in many contexts, but it always means local.Local businesses, consumers, and financial services firms may be referred to as Main Street.The polar opposite of Main Street is Wall Street and the big financial firms and global corporations it represents.In London, Main Street is called High Street.There are numerous grants and loan opportunities for Main Street businesses. 


   Understanding Main Street  

Main Street may be the most common street name in the United States. According to the U.S. Small Business Association, as of March 2020, there are 31.7 million small businesses, the backbone of local Main Streets across America, in the United States. The coronavirus pandemic hit small businesses hard, so while the data isn't out as of September 2021, some small businesses in the 2020 count may not have survived.



In the financial world, Main Street is often cited as the opposite of Wall Street. It may be used to describe the individual small investor as opposed to the professional securities trader.



This can lead to some very unpleasant attitudes on one side or both. For example, some Wall Street traders stereotype Main Street investors as dabblers in a game they can't understand. Main Street investors may see Wall Street traders as crooks with a void where their souls are supposed to be.



The unfortunate fact is that both sides have a high degree of dependence on the other. Wall Street depends on individual investors to generate the capital and fees that keep the lights on. Main Street needs Wall Street to earn a better rate of return than a savings account, or a municipal bond can offer. Unfortunately, this mutual dependence doesn't resolve the conflicts between the two.






The term Main Street may refer to an independently-owned business as opposed to a global corporation.


   Types of Main Street Businesses  

When a business is described as a "Main Street" shop, it usually is a brick-and-mortar store located on the main thoroughfare or block in a village or town. A Main Street business is not a chain store but rather a store that provides goods or services in a personalized fashion. Main Street stores often cater to tourists and locals, especially in picturesque locations.



Of course, small businesses run the gamut and include pharmacies, hair salons, non-chain greengrocers, clothing boutiques, coffee shops, book stores, bakeries, and specialty stores, like toy shops.



The pandemic contributed to the decline of many Main Street businesses, such as restaurants and bars. However, as the economy slowly bounces back in 2021. In particular, coffee shops and breweries represent a sizeable chunk of Main Street businesses as the craft industry continues to grow.


   Main Street vs. Wall Street  

Main Street may also describe a small, independent investment company instead of one globally recognized Wall Street investment firm. Wall Street firms tend to serve institutions and large investors with multi-million dollar assets. Main Street firms provide personalized financial planning and investing services to professionals and families in their locale.



Some people insist that what's good for Wall Street is bad for Main Street and vice versa. For example, regulations designed to protect Main Street investors are seen as hampering Wall Street's ability to innovate and profit. On the other hand, Wall Street compensation practices and trading strategies encourage short-term results and greater risk-taking.



Of course, when Wall Street and Main Street do work together, things can go wrong. This was seen in the financial crisis that hit in 2008 when lenders and borrowers on Main Street created a bubble in housing prices that burst on Wall Street. The result was called the Great Recession. So, we want Main Street and Wall Street to get along, but perhaps not too well. 


  Divide Between Main Street and Wall Street  

During a crisis, Wall Street valuations may soar while Main Street business owners may struggle. For example, when the pandemic hit in March 2020, people flocked online to order food, home goods, medical supplies, and entertainment. During this time, many Main Street restaurants and stores were shuttered or only allowing take-out or a few masked customers in at a time.



Corporations like Walmart and Target found themselves making money due to customers buying in bulk and having items delivered. Small stores could not compete, especially shops in tourist towns or neighborhoods where storeowners' livelihoods depend on visitors from out of town. Even retailers in villages and towns with a robust local economy struggled against competition from Big Box stores and Amazon.


  Investing in Main Street vs. Wall Street  

Suppose you want to support Main Street beyond spending your money locally. In that case, you can invest in Main Street’s smaller entrepreneurs and businesses directly now through peer-to-peer lending and crowdfunding sites. For example, you can invest money via an investment platform like Mainvest, which supports brick and mortar Main Street businesses, or Localstake, a crowdfunding platform, where you can invest in small businesses as well.



Main Street investments are somewhat different from traditional Wall Street investment vehicles like stocks, ETFs, or mutual funds, but the same rules apply. There is a more inherent risk in investing in small start-ups or businesses versus putting investment dollars in more robust stock portfolios with large corporations.



Small businesses like a toy or book store, barbershop, or local deli, are not listed on the stock market, but you can invest in them via crowdfunding for peer-to-peer lending. Heavy hitters like Amazon, Walmart, Apple, and Google are driving the stock market, which can rise even your neighborhood Main Street shops are going out of business.






Small business owners should investigate the numerous grants complied and listed by the National Main Street Center.


   Main Street and Government Programs  
  Main Street Lending Program  

There are government programs designed specifically to support Main Street businesses. During the Covid-19 pandemic on April 9, 2020, the government created the Main Street Lending Program to support small-to-mid-sized nonprofits and businesses with $600 billion in loans.


  Main Street America  

In addition to federal loan programs, there are also grants and loans available to small business owners via nonprofits. One of these is Main Street America, an off-shoot program of the nonprofit National Main Street Center, Inc, a subsidiary of the National Trust for Historic Preservation. On its website, Main Street America offers a compilation of private grants, crowdsourcing, peer-to-peer lending, and federal services and funding opportunities available to Main Street businesses.


   The Bottom Line  

Small business is imperative for Main Streets to flourish in the U.S. because strong local economies usually indicate a better quality of life, especially in small towns. While the Covid-19 pandemic hit small businesses hard, government loan programs provided much-needed support.



Thriving local economies, whether in small, rural towns or large urban areas, offer a healthier environment for communities to flourish. Investing in Main Street isn't just about money, and it can be as simple as shopping local regularly, which contributes to the revitalization of towns and city neighborhoods.
What Are Maintenance Expenses?  

The term maintenance expense refers to any cost incurred by an individual or business to keep their assets in good working condition. These costs may be spent for the general maintenance of items like running anti-virus software on computer systems or they may be used for repairs such as fixing a car or machinery. These expenses are in addition to the actual purchase price of an asset, so individuals and companies should be able and willing to foot the bill in order to keep their assets in running order.


   Understanding Maintenance Expenses  

Consumers who purchase assets should expect to pay maintenance expenses at some point in the future if they want to use them over a period of time. As mentioned earlier, these costs are incurred in order to keep an individual or company's assets in good working order.



How much an individual pays in maintenance expenses depends on the type of asset and how often upkeep is required and performed. Individuals may incur maintenance costs for homes, automobiles, appliances, and electronics, while businesses pay for maintenance on their fixed assets—vehicles, equipment, facilities—and their technology.



Keeping up to date with regular maintenance can keep costs down because the asset is serviced on a timely basis. Neglecting assets and waiting until the last minute to service them may result in higher maintenance costs. If the asset isn't maintained at all, the owner may have to replace it altogether.





Key Takeaways

Maintenance expenses are necessary costs for upkeep—whether it's a car, home, rental apartment, or condominium.Neglecting regular maintenance—and not paying expenses for upkeep—may result in higher maintenance costs and, even worse, replacement costs for the asset itself. Individuals pay for maintenance on things like homes, automobiles, and appliances, while companies pay for upkeep on fixed assets and technology. 


   Special Considerations  

Consumers should consider the initial price tag as well as the item's ongoing maintenance expenses when they purchase an item that requires upkeep. This is why it's always a good idea for any consumer to set some money aside for maintenance expenses. Failure to do so may result in financial distress when it comes time to pay for these charges in the future.






It's always a good idea to have money set aside for the regular maintenance of your assets.


   Types of Maintenance Expenses  

As mentioned above, maintenance expenses depend on the type of asset held. Maintenance expenses for homes include lawn care, plumbing, electrical, and roof repairs as well as replacement of worn-out appliances. Homeowners must also pay premiums for hazard insurance. This expense protects the owner from damage to the home from natural events like severe storms, fires, tornados, and earthquakes. 


  Landlords and Tenants  

Most of the maintenance expenses for a rental property are the landlord's responsibility. Snow removal, sewage, trash pickup, lawn care as well as the sidewalks, windows, and any exterior expense falls to the landlord to pay. If the apartment or rental home is furnished, any replacement or repair of the furniture is the landlord’s responsibility. Cleaning or replacement of any carpeting, as well as painting, is also paid for by the landlord.



Government regulations require landlords to maintain certain safety and living standards. For example, the heat in an apartment building must meet minimum standards. The infrastructure, such as heating and ventilation, must be adequately maintained by the landlord. Some of the upkeep and maintenance may fall on the tenant. The rental agreement should define what expenses are the renter's responsibility.


  Condo Fees  

Monthly fees are common for people who own condominiums. Condo fees can range from $50 to $1,000 depending on the property, building, and location. If the building has a concierge, swimming pool, tennis courts, or gym, those costs are built into the monthly condo fee.



Buyers who want maintenance-free living should consider the monthly fees when calculating their affordability and the potential mortgage payment for the condominium. If, for example, the mortgage payment is $1,500 per month while the condo fee is $600 per month, the condo fee represents nearly 30% of the total monthly payments to live there.


   Example of Maintenance Expenses  

Owning a vehicle requires regular maintenance—oil changes, tire rotation, and engine flushes. Owners can enjoy their vehicles by keeping up to date with and paying for these expenses on a timely and regular basis. People who don't maintain their vehicles or wait too long may have to pay more in maintenance and may even have to pay the replacement cost for a new vehicle.
What Is Maintenance Margin?  

Maintenance margin is the minimum equity an investor must hold in the margin account after the purchase has been made; it is currently set at 25% of the total value of the securities in a margin account as per Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) requirements.





Key Takeaways

Maintenance margin is the minimum amount of equity that an investor must maintain in the margin account after the purchase has been made.Maintenance margin is currently set at 25% of the total value of the securities in a margin account as per FINRA requirements.﻿﻿The investor may be hit with a margin call if the account equity falls below the maintenance margin threshold which may necessitate that the investor liquidate positions until the requirement is satisfied.


   Understanding Maintenance Margin  

Although FINRA requires a 25% minimum maintenance margin, many brokerage firms may require that as much as 30% to 40% of the securities' total value should be available. Maintenance margin is also called a minimum maintenance or maintenance requirement.



A margin account is an account with a brokerage firm that allows an investor to buy securities including stocks, bonds or options—all with cash loaned by the broker. All margin accounts, or purchasing securities on margin, have strict rules and regulations. The maintenance margin is one such rule. It stipulates the minimum amount of equity—the total value of securities in the margin account minus anything borrowed from the brokerage firm—that must be in a margin account at all times as long as the investor holds on to the securities purchased.



So if an investor has $10,000 worth of equity in their margin account, they must maintain a minimum amount of $2,500 in the margin account. If the value of their equity increases to $15,000, then the maintenance margin also rises to $3,750. The investor is hit with a margin call if the value of securities falls below the maintenance margin.



Margin trading is regulated by the federal government and other self-regulatory agencies in an effort to mitigate potentially crippling losses for both investors and brokerages. There are multiple regulators of margin trading, the most important of which are the Federal Reserve Board and FINRA.


   Margin Accounts vs. Maintenance Margins  

Investors and brokerage firms must sign an agreement before opening a margin account. According to the terms of the agreement set forth by FINRA and the Federal Reserve Board, the account requires a minimum margin be met before investors can trade on the account. The minimum or initial margin must be at least $2,000 in cash or securities.



The Federal Reserve Board’s Regulation T (Reg T) sets a limit on how much an investor can borrow, which is up to 50% of the price of the security purchased. Some brokers require more than a 50% deposit from the investor.



Once an investor buys a security on margin, the maintenance margin goes into effect with FINRA requiring that at least 25% of the total market value of the securities be in the account at all times. Still, many brokers can require more as stipulated in the margin agreement.



If the equity in a margin account falls below the maintenance margin, the broker issues a margin call, which requires that the investor deposit more cash into the margin account bring the level of funds up to the maintenance margin or liquidate securities in order to fulfill the maintenance amount. The broker reserves the right to sell the securities in a margin account, sometimes without consulting the investor, to meet the maintenance margin. Typically the investor will receive a warning from their broker first, and only upon continued failure to pay the margin call will action be taken. A Federal Call is a special kind of margin call issued by the federal government.






Maintenance minimums also eliminate some of the risk to the brokerage in case the investor defaults on the loan.



Maintenance margins, margin calls, Reg T and FINRA regulations all exist because margin trading has the potential to incur skyrocketing gains—as well as colossal losses. Such losses are a huge financial risk, and if left unchecked can unsettle the securities markets, as well as potentially disrupt the entire financial market.
What Is a Majority Shareholder?  

A majority shareholder is a person or entity that owns and controls more than 50% of a company's outstanding shares. As a majority shareholder, a person or operating entity has a significant amount of influence over the company, especially if their shares are voting shares. Voting shares give a shareholder permission to vote on different corporate decisions, such as who should be on the company’s board of directors. 



When a majority shareholder is in possession of voting shares, the person or entity may hold significant sway over the direction of the company.





Key Takeaways

A majority shareholder is a person or entity who holds more than 50% of shares of a company.If the majority shareholder holds voting shares, they may dictate the direction of the company through their voting power because voting shares give a shareholder permission to vote on different corporate decisions, such as who should be on the company’s board of directors. The exception to a majority shareholder's voting power is if a super-majority is required for a particular voting issue, or certain company bylaws restrict the power of the majority shareholder.


   Understanding the Majority Shareholder  

A majority shareholder is often the founder of the company. In the case of long-established businesses, the majority shareholder may also be the descendants of the founder. By controlling more than half of the voting interest, the majority shareholder is a key stakeholder and influencer in the business operations and strategic direction of the company. For example, it may be in their power to replace a corporation’s officers or board of directors.



However, not all companies have a majority shareholder, and it is more common for private companies to have majority stakeholders than public companies.



For those companies that do have a majority shareholderIt's also true that the role of a majority shareholder can look very different from one company to another. Some remain very involved in daily operations while others leave management to company executives. The majority shareholder of a company may or may not be a member of upper management, such as the chief executive officer (CEO). This scenario is more likely in a smaller company with a limited number of shares.



In larger firms, like those with a market capitalization in the billions of dollars, the firm’s investors may include other institutions that hold a larger number of shares.





Key Takeaways

A majority shareholder is a person or entity who holds more than 50% of shares of a company.If the majority shareholder holds voting shares, they dictate the direction of the company through their voting power.The exception to a majority shareholder's voting power is if a super-majority is required for a particular voting issue, or certain company bylaws restrict the power of the majority shareholder.


   Majority Shareholders and Buyouts  

Majority shareholders who seek to exit a business or dilute their position may make overtures to their competition or to private equity firms, with the objective of selling their stake or the entire company for a profit.



In order for a buyout to occur, an outside entity must acquire over 50% of a target company’s outstanding shares, or have the votes of at least 50% of the current shareholders who will vote in favor of the buyout. A buyout is the acquisition of a controlling interest in a company. It is typically used synonymously with the term acquisition.



Even though a majority shareholder may hold more than half of company shares, they may not have the authority to authorize a buyout without additional support, depending on stipulations in the company’s bylaws. In cases where a supermajority is required for a buyout, the majority shareholder can be the sole deciding factor (but only in cases where they hold enough stock to meet the supermajority requirement and the minority shareholders do not have additional rights to block the effort).



Minority shareholder rights can include the declaration of a derivative action or fraud. These actions effectively block the completion of a buyout. If the minority shareholders believe the terms of the buyout are unfair and they wish to exit the targeted business, they can exercise appraisal rights. This allows a court to determine if an offered share price is fair. If the offer is, in fact, found to be unfair, the court can also compel the business initiating the buyout to offer a specified price.


   Example of a Majority Shareholder  

Majority shareholders are often companies that own a controlling stake in many companies. For example, the company Berkshire Hathaway, of which Warren Buffett is the CEO, has a controlling interest in many other companies.



Berkshire Hathaway is a majority shareholder in other companies. But Berkshire Hathaway itself also has shareholders. However, Berkshire Hathaway doesn't have a majority shareholder.



Because most companies that have majority shareholders are very small, there are not very many companies that are household, or well-known, that have a majority shareholder (because these companies tend to be larger). One exception is Dell Technologies Inc. According to a Dell Technologies Proxy filing in May with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Micheal Dell controls about half of the company's equity (52%).
What Is a Make-or-Buy Decision?  

A make-or-buy decision is an act of choosing between manufacturing a product in-house or purchasing it from an external supplier.



Also referred to as an outsourcing decision, a make-or-buy decision compares the costs and benefits associated with producing a necessary good or service internally to the costs and benefits involved in hiring an outside supplier for the resources in question.



To compare costs accurately, a company must consider all aspects regarding the acquisition and storage of the items versus creating the items in-house, which may require the purchase of new equipment, as well as storage costs.





Key Takeaways

A make-or-buy decision is an act of choosing between manufacturing a product in-house or purchasing it from an external supplier.Make-or-buy decisions, like outsourcing decisions, speak to a comparison of the costs and advantages of producing in-house versus buying it elsewhere.There are many factors at play that may tilt a company from making an item in-house or outsourcing it, such as labor costs, lack of expertise, storage costs, supplier contracts, and lack of sufficient volume.Companies use quantitative analysis to determine whether making or buying is the most cost-efficient method.


   Understanding a Make-or-Buy Decision  

Regarding in-house production, a business must include expenses related to the purchase and maintenance of any production equipment and the cost of production materials. Costs to make the product can include the additional labor required to produce the items, which takes the form of wages and benefits, storage requirements within the facility, holding costs overall, and the proper disposal of any remnants or byproducts from the production process.



Buy costs related to purchasing the products from an outside source must include the price of the good itself, any shipping or importing fees, and applicable sales tax charges. Additionally, the company must factor in the expenses relating to the storage of the incoming product and labor costs associated with receiving the products into inventory. It also includes signing any contracts with suppliers that might require the company to be locked-in to certain deals for a certain period of time.



In a make-or-buy decision, the most important factors to consider are part of quantitative analysis, such as the associated costs of production and whether the business can produce at required levels.


   Choosing Make or Buy  

The results of the quantitative analysis may be sufficient to make a determination based on the approach that is more cost-effective. At times, the qualitative analysis addresses any concerns a company cannot measure specifically.



Factors that may influence a firm's decision to buy a part rather than produce it internally include a lack of in-house expertise, small volume requirements, a desire for multiple sourcing, and the fact that the item may not be critical to the firm's strategy.



A company may give additional consideration if the firm has the opportunity to work with a company that has previously provided outsourced services successfully and can sustain a long-term relationship.






If a firm is going to buy or outsource, it's essential that they work with a company that they can rely on for the long-term.



Similarly, factors that may tilt a firm toward making an item in-house include existing idle production capacity, better quality control, or proprietary technology that needs to be protected. A company may also consider concerns regarding the reliability of the supplier, especially if the product in question is critical to normal business operations. The firm should also consider whether the supplier can offer the desired long-term arrangement if that is what it requires.


   Why Choose?  

If a company is already in business there may be a point when certain situations arise that will cause a company to pause and consider which direction it should proceed in; whether it should buy or make the parts or products it needs.



Some of these events could be a trusted supplier shutting down, an increase or decrease in demand for the product, or a possible path for new opportunities. At these junctions, management will have to consider the advantages of either making or buying the product, which can also be outside of a cost-benefit analysis. Will one decision lead to economies of scale, to a possible new product line, or a restructuring of the core business?



Depending on the business and its place in the market, there will be both advantages and disadvantages of continuing down the same path or forging a new one.
What Is Make to Order (MTO)?  

Make to order (MTO), or made to order, is a business production strategy that typically allows consumers to purchase products that are customized to their specifications. It is a manufacturing process in which the production of an item begins only after a confirmed customer order is received. It is also known as mass customization.





Key Takeaways

Make to order (MTO), or made to order, is a business production strategy that typically allows consumers to purchase products that are customized to their specifications.The manufacturing process of an MTO item begins only after a confirmed customer order is received.Advantages to MTO include customization for customers, reduction in stock obsolescence and finished goods inventory, and overall waste.Disadvantages to MTO include increased costs and increased wait times for a finished product.MTO can be contrasted with make to stock (MTS) manufacturing, whereby inventories are produced in advance of consumers buying them off the shelf.


   Understanding Make to Order (MTO)  

The make-to-order (MTO) strategy means that a firm only manufactures the end product once the customer places the order, creating additional wait time for the consumer to receive the product, but allowing for more flexible customization when compared to purchasing directly from retailers' shelves.



This type of manufacturing strategy is referred to as a pull-type supply chain operation because products are only made when there is firm customer demand. The pull-type production model is employed by the assembly industry where the quantity needed to be produced per product specification is one or only a few. This includes specialized industries such as construction, aircraft and vessel production, bridges, and so on. MTO is also appropriate for highly configured products such as computer servers, automobiles, bicycles, or products that are very expensive to keep inventory.



In order to manage inventory levels and provide an increased level of customization, some companies adopt the make to order production system. The MTO strategy relieves the problems of excess inventory that is common with the traditional make-to-stock strategy. Dell Computers is an example of a business that uses the MTO production strategy, wherein customers can order a fully customized computer online and receive it in a couple of weeks.



The main advantage of the MTO system is the ability to fulfill an order with the exact product specification required by the customer. Sales discounts and finished goods inventory are also reduced, and stock obsolescence is managed. However, for an MTO system to succeed, it should be coupled with proactive demand management. It should also be considered that the MTO system is not appropriate for all types of products.



Related to MTO is assemble to order (ATO), which is a business production strategy where products ordered by customers are produced quickly and are customizable to a certain extent. The assemble-to-order (ATO) strategy requires that the basic parts of the product are already manufactured but not yet assembled. Once an order is received, the parts are assembled quickly and sent to the customer.


   Make to Order (MTO) vs. Make to Stock (MTS)  

Traditional production methodologies produce products and stock them as inventory until a customer buys them. This is known as make to stock (MTS). However, this system may be prone to wastage and obsolescence, as inventory sits on shelves awaiting purchase. This problem is particularly acute in an industry like technology, where the pace of advancement is quick and the problem of obsolete inventory could quickly arise.



In theory, the MTS method is a great way for a company to prepare for increases and decreases in demand. However, inventory numbers and, therefore, production, are derived by creating future demand forecasts based on past data.



There is a high likelihood that the forecasts will be off, even if by just slightly, meaning that a company might be stuck with too much inventory and too little liquidity. This is the main drawback of the MTS method of production. Inaccurate forecasts will lead to losses, stemming from excess inventory or stockouts, and in fast-paced sectors, such as electronics or computer tech, excess inventory can quickly become obsolete.


   Limitations of Make to Order (MTO)  

The two main drawbacks of make-to-order management are timeliness and cost of customization. If products are already on the shelf as with MTS, then a customer need not wait until the product is made, assembled, and delivered to spec. Cost is also a factor; pre-made and available products are all alike and so manufacturing costs are lowered due to economies of scale. Make to order will tend to be more expensive for the consumer since it involves customizable parts and finishes.
What Is Make to Stock (MTS)?  

Make to stock (MTS) is a traditional production strategy that is used by businesses to match inventory with anticipated consumer demand. Instead of setting a production level and then attempting to sell goods, a company using MTS would estimate how many orders its products could generate, and then supply enough stock to meet those orders.





Key Takeaways

Make to stock (MTS) is a traditional production strategy that is used to match inventory with anticipated consumer demand.The MTS method requires an accurate forecast of this demand to determine how much stock it produces.To implement an MTS approach a business needs to redesign operations at specific times, instead of keeping a steady level of production year-round.The main drawback of the MTS method is that if a forecast is inaccurate a company can be left with too little or too much inventory, which can impact the bottom line.


   How Make to Stock (MTS) Works  

The make-to-stock method requires an accurate forecast of demand to determine how much stock it produces. If demand for the product can be estimated accurately, the MTS strategy is an efficient choice for production.



In theory, the MTS method is a way for a company to prepare for increases and decreases in demand. However, inventory numbers and, consequently, production, are typically obtained through the creation of future demand forecasts that have a basis in past data.



Should the forecast be even slightly off, the company may find they have too much inventory and limited liquidity, or too little inventory and unmet profit potential. This possibility of error is the primary disadvantage of using the MTS system for production. Wrong information can lead to excess inventory, stockouts (unavailable inventory), and revenue losses. It can also lead to an inability to meet demand, which reduces income potential. In fast-paced sectors such as electronics or computer tech, excess inventory can quickly become obsolete.



Also, an MTS approach requires a business to redesign operations at specific times, instead of keeping a steady level of production year-round. This regular adjustment can be costly, and the increased costs must either pass on to the consumer or be absorbed by the company.






The typical unpredictability of the economy and business cycles make MTS challenging for any company, but the strategy becomes particularly complicated when a business operates in a sector that experiences cyclical or seasonal sales cycles.


   Alternatives to Make to Stock (MTS)  

Common alternative production strategies that avoid the downsides of MTS include make to order (MTO) and assemble to order (ATO). Both tie production to demand, but in the case of MTO, the output of an item begins after the company receives a valid customer order. ATO is something of a compromise between MTS and MTO—basic parts are constructed in advance, but a finished product is not created until a valid order comes in.


   Example of Make to Stock (MTS)  

Manufacturing companies often use the MTS method to prepare for periods of high production. For example, many retailers, such as Target, generate most of their sales in the fourth quarter of the year. For the manufacturing companies supplying these retailers, a majority of their production has to come in the second and third quarters of the year, to prepare for the increases in demand.



Using the MTS production method, let's say that The LEGO Group, maker of the popular LEGO bricks and other toys, looks back at its previous years and surmises, based on past data, that demand will increase by 40% in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter. To prepare, the manufacturer produces 40% more of its toys in July, August and September to meet the demand forecasts for the fourth quarter. Additionally, during the fourth quarter, LEGO looks at past numbers to see how much demand will decline from the end of the year to the first quarter of the new year, reducing production accordingly.



If LEGO is adopting an MTO strategy, it will not increase the production of, say, its LEGO bricks by 40% until and unless Target sent in a larger order for them. If it were taking an ATO approach, it might have the increased bricks made and ready, but wouldn't put together complete packaged kits of them until it received Target's order. This way, the risk of an inaccurate demand forecast is mitigated, as both LEGO and Target share it.




What Are the Benefits of Make to Stock?
One of main benefits of the make to stock (MTS) production strategy is the ability to produce inventory based on anticipated consumer demand. MTS allows a company to avoid having to much or too little inventory.




What Are the Drawbacks of Make to Stock?
In order for make to stock to be an effective strategy accurate forecasts are a must. An inaccurate forecast can result is excess inventory or the inability to meet demand.




What Is an Example of Make to Stock?
The make-to-stock strategy might be used by companies that produce goods that tend to be particularly popular during the holiday season. For instance, a toy manufacturer would forecast consumer demand and produce products accordingly.


   The Bottom Line  

Make to stock is a traditional manufacturing strategy that matches inventory with forecasted consumer demand. The effectiveness of the MTS approach is entirely reliant on the ability of a company to correctly predict the future demand customers will have for its products. If a forecast misses the mark, a company can be left with excess inventory or not enough, which can negatively impact its bottom line.
What Is a Make-Whole Call?  

A make-whole call provision is a type of call provision on a bond allowing the issuer to pay off remaining debt early. The issuer typically has to make a lump-sum payment to the investor. The payment is derived from a formula based on the net present value (NPV) of previously scheduled coupon payments and the principal that the investor would have received.





Key Takeaways

A make-whole call provision is a type of call provision on a bond allowing the issuer to pay off remaining debt early.The payment is derived from a formula based on the net present value (NPV) of previously scheduled coupon payments and the principal that the investor would have received.Issuers typically don't expect to have to use this type of call provision, and make-whole calls are rarely exercised.Make-whole calls are better for investors than standard call provisions.


   Understanding Make-Whole Calls  

Make-whole call provisions are defined in the indenture of a bond. These provisions began to be included in bond indentures in the 1990s. Issuers typically don't expect to have to use this type of call provision, and make-whole calls are rarely exercised. However, the issuer may decide to utilize its make-whole call provision on a bond. Then, investors will be compensated, or made whole, for the remaining payments and principal from the bond as noted within the bond's indenture.



In a make-whole call, the investor receives a single payment for the NPV of all future cash flows of the bond. That typically includes the remaining coupon payments associated with the bond under the make-whole call provision. It also includes the par value principal payment of the bond. A lump-sum payment paid to an investor in a make-whole call provision is equal to the NPV of all these future payments. The payments were agreed upon in the make-whole call provision within the indenture. The NPV is calculated based on the market discount rate.



Make-whole calls are typically exercised when interest rates have decreased. Therefore, the discount rate for the NPV calculation is likely to be lower than the initial rate when the bond was offered. That works to the benefit of the investor. A lower NPV discount rate can make the make-whole call payments slightly more expensive for the issuer. The cost of a make-whole call can often be high, so such provisions are rarely invoked.






Bonds are less likely to be called in a stable interest rate environment. Call provisions were more of an issue when interest rates generally declined between 1980 and 2008.



Make-whole call provisions can be expensive to exercise because they require a full lump sum payment. Consequently, companies that utilize make-whole call provisions usually do so because interest rates have fallen. When rates have decreased or are trending lower, a company has an added incentive to exercise make-whole call provisions. If interest rates have dropped, then issuers of corporate bonds can issue new bonds at a lower rate of interest. These new bonds require lower coupon payments to their investors.


   Advantages of Make-Whole Calls  

Make-whole calls are better for investors than standard call provisions. With a standard call, the investor would only receive the principal in the event of a call. With a make-whole call, the investor gets the NPV of future payments.



There is actually a case where a make-whole call provision provides no benefits. Consider an investor who buys a bond at par value when it is first issued. If the bond is immediately called, then the investor gets the principal back and can reinvest it at the same prevailing open-market rate. The investor does not need any additional payments to be made whole.



The advantages of make-whole calls are most apparent after interest rates fall. Once again, we can start with an investor who bought a bond at par value when it was first issued. This time, suppose interest rates decline from 10% to 5% after the investor holds a 20-year bond for ten years. If this investor receives only the principal back, the investor will have to reinvest at the lower 5% rate. In this case, the NPV of future payments provided by a make-whole call provision compensates the investor for having to reinvest at a lower rate.



Investors in the secondary market are also aware of the value of make-whole call provisions. All other things being equal, bonds with make-whole call provisions will typically trade at a premium to those with standard call provisions. Investors pay less money for bonds with standard call provisions because they have more call risk.
What Is Malpractice Insurance?  

Malpractice insurance is a type of professional liability insurance purchased by healthcare professionals. This insurance coverage protects healthcare providers against patients who file suits against them under the complaint that they were harmed by the professional's negligence or intentionally harmful treatment decisions. Malpractice insurance also covers the death of a patient.





Key Takeaways

Malpractice insurance is a type of professional liability insurance intended to cover healthcare professionals.Patients can file lawsuits against healthcare professionals seeking damages for medical negligence that resulted in further health problems or death.Studies show that medical negligence is the third leading cause of death in the United States, so more likely than not, a healthcare professional will need malpractice insurance.Malpractice insurance can be obtained through a private insurer, through an employer, or through organizations, such as medical risk retention groups (RRGs).The two basic types of professional liability insurance are claims-made policies or occurrence policies.Legal costs, punitive damages, and medical damages are all covered under malpractice insurance.


   Understanding Malpractice Insurance  

Most medical doctors will need malpractice insurance sometime during their professional career, and for good reason. A study by Johns Hopkins University found medical errors to be the third leading cause of death in the United States, behind heart disease and cancer.



Medical negligence can happen during diagnosis, during treatment, or as part of the advice given for treatment after an illness. Approximately 250,000 deaths in the U.S. arise from medical errors every year.



Some studies show that more than 17,000 malpractice lawsuits are brought to healthcare professionals every year in the United States. An average U.S. doctor can expect to have a malpractice lawsuit brought against them once every seven years. This underlines the importance of having malpractice insurance for a healthcare professional.



States require that medical professionals have current malpractice coverage to work in hospitals and other medical facilities. Medical malpractice insurance premiums are usually based on the physician's specialty and geographic location, not on claims experience. This means that even if a physician has never been sued, they can end up paying extremely high premiums. The premiums can be high because of such factors as the amount of coverage needed, claims severity, claims frequency, location of practice, and laws in the area.

   Types of Malpractice Insurance  

There are many options for procuring malpractice insurance. In the most basic form, an insurance policy can be purchased for an individual or group by a private insurer. Individual or group policies can also be purchased by a medical risk retention group (RRG). An RRG is a group of medical professionals organized to provide malpractice insurance. Another option for obtaining malpractice insurance is under the coverage plan of an employer, such as a hospital.



Individuals that work as medical professionals under the government do not need to obtain malpractice insurance as the federal government insures against liability claims. Insurance can often also be obtained through state and local agencies if the situation deems it necessary.



The two types of policies that a healthcare professional can purchase are a claims-made policy or an occurrence policy. A claims-made policy only covers claims if the policy was in effect when the treatment occurred and when the lawsuit was made. An occurrence policy covers any claim that was made on a treatment that occurred while the policy was in effect, even if the policy has since expired.



The types of costs covered under a malpractice policy are wide. They include all legal fees, such as lawyer fees, settlement and arbitration costs, medical damages, and punitive damages.


   Proving a Malpractice Lawsuit  

In a medical malpractice lawsuit, the plaintiff needs to prove a medical professional violated the general standard of care of a patient, as defined by the medical community. In order to be successful in a medical malpractice lawsuit, three things generally need to happen:



The plaintiff's attorney must prove there was a breach of medical protocol that resulted in a practitioner choosing a different course of action than a colleague would have taken. The medical professional cause physical or emotional injury.There must be sufficient evidence proving the medical professional caused the damage.
What Is a Managed Account?  

A managed account is an investment account that is owned by an investor but managed by somebody else. The account owner can either be an institutional investor or an individual retail investor. A professional money manager hired by the investor then oversees the account and the trading activity within it.



Armed with discretionary authority over the account, the dedicated manager actively makes investment decisions pertinent to the individual, considering the client's needs and goals, risk tolerance, and asset size. Managed accounts are most often seen among high-net-worth investors.





Key Takeaways

A managed account is a portfolio that is owned by one investor but is supervised by a professional money manager who has been hired by that investor.Money managers can demand six-figure minimum investments to manage accounts and are compensated by a fee, calculated as a set percentage of assets under management (AUM).Robo-advisors offer algorithmically-managed accounts at a lower cost for everyday investors with low starting balances.A mutual fund is a type of managed account, but it is open to anyone with the means to buy its shares, rather than personalized for a particular investor.


   How a Managed Account Works  

A managed account may contain financial assets, cash, or titles to property. The money or investment manager has the authority to buy and sell assets without the client’s prior approval, as long as they act according to the client’s objectives. Because a managed account involves fiduciary duty, the manager must act in the best interest of the client or potentially face civil or criminal penalties. The investment manager will typically supply the client with regular reports on the account's performance and holdings.



Money managers often have minimum dollar amounts on the accounts they will manage, meaning a client must have a certain amount of funds to invest. Many minimums start at $250,000, though some managers will accept $100,000 and even $50,000 accounts.



Managers will usually charge an annual fee for their services, calculated as a percentage of the assets under management (AUM). Compensation fees range greatly, but most average around 1% to 2% of AUM. Many managers will provide discounts based on an account's asset size, so that the larger the portfolio, the smaller the percentage fee. According to the Internal Revenue Service, these fees are no longer tax-deductible as investment expenses.



A new innovation to managed accounts aimed at lay investors is the so-called robo-advisor. Robo-advisors are digital platforms that provide automated, algorithmically-driven portfolio management with little to no human supervision. These platforms are typically cheaper, charging, for example, somewhere in the region of 0.25% of AUM, and may require as little as $5 to get started.






Managed accounts are typically used by high-net-worth individuals as they often require a high minimum dollar amount of investment.


   Managed Accounts vs. Mutual Funds  

Managed accounts and mutual funds both represent actively managed portfolios or pools of money that invest over a variety of assets—or asset classes.



Technically, a mutual fund is a type of managed account. The fund company will hire a money manager to look after investments in the fund's portfolio. This manager may alter the fund's holdings per the fund's objectives.



When mutual funds began to be marketed in earnest in the 1950s, they were touted as a way for the "little guy"—that is, small retail investors—to experience and benefit from professional money management. Previously, this was a service available only to high-net-worth individuals.





Pros

Customized managed accounts address the account holder's needs; mutual funds invest according to the fund's objectives.
Managed account trades can be timed to minimize tax liability; mutual fund investors have no control when a fund realizes taxable capital gains.
Managed account-holders have maximum transparency and control over assets; mutual fund-holders don't own the fund's assets, only a share of the fund's asset value.



Cons

Some managed accounts require six-figure minimum in funds; mutual funds demand much lower initial investment amounts.
It may take days to invest, or de-vest managed account assets; mutual fund shares are more liquid and can be bought or sold daily.
Managed account managers tend to charge high annual fees that impact overall returns; mutual funds' expense ratio fees tend to be lower.





  Management Considerations  

Both managed accounts and mutual funds are overseen by professional managers. Managed accounts are personalized investment portfolios customized to the specific risks, goals, and needs of the account holder. Management of the mutual fund is on behalf of the many mutual fund holders and all about meeting the fund's investment and return objectives.



With a managed account, the investor allocates funds, and the manager purchases and places physical shares of securities into the account portfolio. The account holder owns the securities and may direct the manager to trade them as desired.



In contrast, mutual funds are classified by investors’ risk tolerance and the funds’ investment objectives, not by individual preferences. Also, investors purchasing shares of a mutual fund own a percentage of the value of the fund, not the fund itself or the actual assets in the fund.


  Transactional Considerations  

On the transactional side, events might move more slowly in a managed account. Days may pass before the manager has the money fully invested. Also, depending on the holdings selected, managers may be able to liquidate securities at specific times only.



Conversely, shares of mutual funds may typically be purchased and redeemed as desired, daily. However, some mutual funds may carry penalties if redeemed before holding for a specified period.



The professional guiding a managed account may attempt to offset gains and losses by buying and selling assets when it is the most tax beneficial to the account's owner. In doing so, it could result in little or no tax liabilities on a significant profit for the individual. In contrast, mutual fund shareholders have no control over when portfolio managers sell the underlying securities, so they may face tax bites on capital gains.


   Special Considerations  

In July 2016, managed funds were in the news, as several institutional investors simultaneously opted for them over the hedge funds that had been handling a portion of their portfolios. The investors wanted broader platforms, customized strategies, full control over their separate accounts, daily valuation, significantly lower fees, and full transparency when it came to those fees, as well as to the nature of the holdings themselves.



Pensions & Investments claimed that the state-managed Alaska Permanent Fund Corp. in Juneau redeemed US$2 billion in hedge funds to invest in a managed account so that investment decisions would be in-house. It was also reported that the $28.2 billion Iowa Public Employees’ Retirement System set up plans for moving $700 million in investments to managed accounts with seven firms in 2016.
What Are Managed Futures?  

Managed futures refers to an investment where a portfolio of futures contracts is actively managed by professionals. Managed futures are considered an alternative investment and are often used by funds and institutional investors to provide both portfolio and market diversification.



Managed futures provide this portfolio diversification by offering exposure to asset classes to help mitigate portfolio risk in a way that is not possible in direct capital investments like stocks and bonds. The performance of managed futures tends to be weakly or inversely correlated with traditional stock and bond markets, making them ideal investments to round out a portfolio constructed according to modern portfolio theory.





Key Takeaways

Managed futures are alternative investments consisting of a portfolio of futures contracts that are actively managed by professionals.Large funds and institutional investors frequently use managed futures as an alternative to traditional hedge funds to achieve both portfolio and market diversification.Two common approaches for trading managed futures are the market-neutral strategy and the trend-following strategy.Market-neutral strategies look to profit from spreads and arbitrage created by mispricing, whereas trend-following strategies look to profit by going long or short according to fundamentals or technical market signals.


   Understanding Managed Futures  

Managed futures have increasingly been positioned as an alternative to traditional hedge funds. Funds and other institutional investors often use hedge fund investments as a way of diversifying their traditional investment portfolios of large market cap stocks and highly rated bonds.



One of the reasons hedge funds were an ideal diversification play is that they are active in the futures market. Managed futures have developed in this space to offer a cleaner diversification play for these institutional investors.


   The Rise of Managed Futures  

Managed futures evolved out of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission Act, which helped to define the role of commodity trading advisors (CTA) and commodity pool operators (CPO). These professional money managers differed from stock market fund managers because they worked regularly with derivatives in a way most money managers did not.



The Commodity Futures and Trading Commission (CFTC) and the National Futures Association (NFA) regulate CTAs and CPOs, conducting audits and ensuring that they meet quarterly reporting requirements. The heavy regulation of the industry is another reason these investment products have gained favor with institutional investors over hedge funds.


   How Managed Futures Trade  

Managed futures can have various weights in stocks and derivative investments. A diversified managed futures account will generally have exposure to a number of markets such as commodities, energy, agriculture, and currency. Most managed futures accounts will have a stated trading program that describes its market approach. Two common approaches are the market-neutral strategy and the trend-following strategy.


  Market-Neutral Strategy  

Market-neutral strategies look to profit from spreads and arbitrage created by mispricing. Investors who employ this strategy frequently look to mitigate market risk by taking matching long and short positions in a particular industry in an attempt to achieve profit from both increasing and decreasing prices.


  Trend-Following Strategy  

Trend-following strategies look to profit by going long or short according to fundamentals and/or technical market signals. When an asset's price is trending lower, trend traders may decide to enter into a short position on that asset. Conversely, when an asset is trending upward, trend traders may enter into a long position. The goal is to capture gains by analyzing various indicators, determining an asset's direction, and then executing an appropriate trade.



Investors looking into managed futures can request disclosure documents that will outline the trading strategy, the annualized rate of return, and other performance measures.
What Is a Management Buyout (MBO)?  

The term management buyout (MBO) refers to a financial transaction where someone from corporate management or the team purchases the business from the owner(s). Management members that execute MBOs purchase everything associated with the business. This type of buyout appeals to professional managers because of the greater potential rewards and control from being owners of the business rather than employees. The MBO is a type of leveraged buyout (LBO), which is an acquisition funded primarily with borrowed capital.





Key Takeaways

A management buyout is a transaction where a company’s management team purchases the assets and operations of the business they manage.MBOs generally occur to take companies private in an effort to streamline operations and improve profitability.A management team pools resources to acquire all or part of a business they manage.MBOs are financed with a mix of personal resources, private equity financiers, and seller-financing.A management buyout is the opposite of a management buy-in, where an external management team acquires a company and replaces the existing management.

   How Management Buyouts (MBOs) Work  

As noted above, management buyouts occur when a corporate manager or team acquires the business they manage from the owner(s). The business is purchased from a private owner and/or any shareholders in the company. The acquisition includes everything associated with the business, including the assets and liabilities. MBOs often take place because the management feels they are better equipped to help the company grow and succeed financially. These transactions are key exit strategies for:



Large corporations that want to sell off unprofitable assets or those that no longer make sensePrivate businesses where the owners wish to retire



The financing required for an MBO is often quite substantial and is usually a combination of debt and equity that is derived from the buyers, financiers, and sometimes the seller. Since it uses a significant amount of borrowed capital, it is considered an LBO. As such, it may also be called a leveraged management buyout.



While management reaps the rewards of ownership following an MBO, they have to make the transition from being employees to owners, which comes with significantly more responsibility and a greater potential for loss.


   Reasons for an MBO  

Management buyouts are risky ventures. That's because they may or may not work. So why would a company's management consider doing one? The following are some of the main reasons that corporate management may consider undertaking an MBO.



Gaining control. Members of management may not agree with the direction of the company. By executing an MBO, they may feel as though they have more control of the business, its success, and its future.Financial gain. Members of the management team may not feel as though they aren't getting the full financial benefit just by managing the company. By acquiring the company, they can reap the benefits. They have the expertise. Management may feel as though the owner(s) doesn't have the knowledge or ability to lead the company. Corporate management may have the educational or work experience to help them guide the company to new heights and they may feel that the only way to do that is through an MBO. 


   How to Approach a Management Buyout  

A successful MBO requires a great deal of planning and preparation. As such, it should never be undertaken hastily. The following are a few factors that should be considered in the process.


  Considerations Before the MBO  

Any type of financial transaction should be well-researched. As such, management should craft a plan or proposal that's fully thought out and conceived. Some points to add include:



The members of the management team involved in the MBOThe reasons for the buyoutThe intentions and goals after completionThe terms of the deal, including the purchase priceThe way the buyout will be financed



It's always a good idea for management to show the company's owner(s) that they've done their homework. This includes adding in spreadsheets and doing a thorough analysis.


  Financing  

A significant amount of money is required for an MBO because of the sheer size. There are a few different sources that management can turn to in order to secure capital for the deal:



Debt: Management normally turns to banks and other lenders to secure financing. Banks tend to consider MBOs to be fairly risky ventures, so they may not fund part or all of management's requests. This means the buyers may have to look for primary funding elsewhere before they turn to a lender to cover any shortfalls.
Private Equity: Private equity firms are usually receptive to finance MBOs if banks refuse. One thing to keep in mind is that these firms often expect to get a share of the company even though they're loaning the money to management.
Other Types: There are some other types of financing that are used by management, including owner financing, which is funded directly through the seller who is repaid, or mezzanine financing, which involves a combination of debt and equity.






Management should do their due diligence while considering an MBO. This includes a full evaluation of the company and its financial and legal framework.


   Advantages and Disadvantages of an MBO  
  Advantages  

Management buyouts are considered good investment opportunities by hedge funds and large financiers, who usually encourage the company to go private so that it can streamline operations and improve profitability away from the public eye. They are encouraged to go public at a much higher valuation down the road.



A private equity fund that supports an MBO will likely pay an attractive price for the asset, provided there is a dedicated management team in place.


  Disadvantages  

There are several drawbacks to the MBO structure as well. While the management team can reap the rewards of ownership, they have to make the transition from being employees to owners, which requires a change in mindset from managerial to entrepreneurial. Not all managers may be successful in making this transition.



The seller may also not realize the best price for the asset sale in an MBO. The managers have a potential conflict of interest if the existing management team is serious about bidding on the assets or operations being divested, Put simply, they could downplay or deliberately sabotage the future prospects of the assets that are for sale to buy them at a relatively low price.





Pros

Good investment opportunity for management and private equity/hedge funds
Private equity funds may pay a good price depending on the circumstances



Cons

Transition for owners and employees may be tough
Can result in a conflict of interest





   Management Buyout (MBO) vs. Management Buy-in (MBI)  

The opposite of an MBO is a management buy-in (MBI). While an MBO involves a company's internal management purchasing the operations, an MBI takes place when an external management team acquires a company and replaces the existing management team. MBIs involve companies that are led by poor management teams or are undervalued.



An MBO’s advantage over an MBI is that as the existing managers are acquiring the business, they have a much better understanding of it and there is no learning curve involved, which would be the case if it were being run by a new set of managers. MBOs are conducted by management teams that want to get the financial reward for the future development of the company more directly than they would do only as employees.






While private equity funds may participate in MBOs, their preference may be for MBIs, where the companies are run by managers they know rather than the incumbent management team.


   Example of an MBO  

One prime example of a management buyout involves the computer and technology company, Dell. In 2013, founder Michael Dell and a private equity firm (Silver Lake Partners) paid shareholders $25 billion as part of a management buyout. Dell took the company private, so he could exert more control over the direction of the company. The company went public again in December 2018. Shares trade on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) under the ticker symbol DELL.




How Do Management Buyouts Work?
Management buyouts work when one or more members of a company's management team want to buy the operations from the owner(s). The goal is to take the company private to help it grow and succeed. These buyouts are typically funded with one or more types of financing, including debt and equity.




What Is an Example of a Management Buyout?
In 2013, Michael Dell partnered with a private equity firm to purchase the computer/technology company he founded from shareholders. He took Dell private before the company went public again in 2018.




How Do You Finance a Management Buyout?
There are a number of ways to finance a managed buyout. Debt financing involves going to banks and other lenders for loans. But banks may not consider financing these types of deals because of the amount of risk involved. Private equity firms, though, are more receptive to loaning money to management. Some companies may require a share in the company in addition to being repaid. Buyers can also approach owners/sellers for loans or use a combination of debt and equity to pay for the acquisition.


   The Bottom Line  

Mergers and acquisitions are a big part of the corporate world. It isn't uncommon to hear about takeovers, vertical mergers, and management buyouts. MBOs involve corporate management putting in an offer to purchase part or all of the business they manage. The goal is to take it private so it can continue to grow. Even though they take place in corporate America, MBOs are also fairly common in the small business world—usually when the company exchanges hands from one generation to the next.
What Is Management by Objectives (MBO)?  

Management by objectives (MBO) is a strategic management model that aims to improve the performance of an organization by clearly defining objectives that are agreed to by both management and employees. According to the theory, having a say in goal setting and action plans encourages participation and commitment among employees, as well as aligning objectives across the organization.





Key Takeaways

Management by objectives (MBO) is a process in which a manager and an employee agree on specific performance goals and then develop a plan to reach them.It is designed to align objectives throughout an organization and boost employee participation and commitment.There are five steps: Define objectives, share them with employees, encourage employees to participate, monitor progress, and finally, evaluate performance and reward achievements.Critics of MBO argue that it leads to employees trying to achieve the set goals by any means necessary, often at the cost of the company.

   Understanding Management by Objectives (MBO)  

Management by objectives (also known as management by planning) is the establishment of a management information system (MIS) to compare actual performance and achievements with the defined objectives. Practitioners claim that the major benefits of MBO are that it improves employee motivation and commitment and allows for better communication between management and employees.



However, a cited weakness of MBO is that it unduly emphasizes the setting of goals to attain objectives, rather than working on a systematic plan to do so. Critics of MBO, such as W. Edwards Deming, argue that setting particular goals like production targets leads workers to meet those targets by any means necessary, including shortcuts that result in poor quality.



In his book that coined the term, Peter Drucker set forth several principles for MBO. Objectives are laid out with the help of employees and are meant to be challenging but achievable. Employees receive daily feedback, and the focus is on rewards rather than punishment. Personal growth and development are emphasized, rather than negativity for failing to reach objectives.






MBO is not a cure-all but a tool to be utilized. It gives organizations a process, with many practitioners claiming that the success of MBO is dependent on the support from top management, clearly outlined objectives, and trained managers who can implement it.


   Management by Objectives (MBO) in 5 Steps  

MBO outlines five steps that organizations should use to put the management technique into practice.



Either determine or revise organizational objectives for the entire company. This broad overview should be derived from the firm’s mission and vision.
Translate the organizational objectives to employees. In 1981, George T. Doran used the acronym SMART (specific, measurable, acceptable, realistic, time-bound) to express the concept.
Stimulate the participation of employees in setting individual objectives. After the organization’s objectives are shared with employees from the top to the bottom, employees should be encouraged to help set their own objectives to achieve these larger organizational objectives. This gives employees greater motivation since they have greater empowerment.
Monitor the progress of employees. In step two, a key component of the objectives was that they are measurable for employees and managers to determine how well they are met.
Evaluate and reward employee progress. This step includes honest feedback on what was achieved and not achieved for each employee.






The term “management by objectives (MBO)” was first used by Peter F. Drucker in his 1954 book titled The Practice of Management.


   Advantages and Disadvantages of Management by Objectives (MBO)  

MBO comes with many advantages and disadvantages.


  Advantages  

Employees take pride in their work and are assigned goals they know they can achieve that match their strengths, skills, and educational experiences.Assigning tailored goals brings a sense of importance to employees, boosting their output and loyalty to the company.Communication between management and employees is increased.Management can create goals that lead to the success of the company.


  Disadvantages  

As MBO is focused on goals and targets, it often ignores other parts of a company, such as the culture of conduct, a healthy work ethos, and areas for involvement and contribution.
Strain is increased on employees to meet the goals in a specified time frame.
Employees are encouraged to meet targets by any means necessary, meaning that shortcuts could be taken and the quality of work compromised.
If management solely relies on MBO for all management responsibilities, it can be problematic for areas that don’t fit under MBO.




What is the goal of management by objectives (MBO)?
Management by objectives (MBO) uses a set of quantifiable or objective standards against which to measure the performance of a company and its employees. By comparing actual productivity to a given set of standards, managers can identify problem areas and improve efficiency. Both management and workers know and agree to these standards and their objectives.




What is an example of MBO?
A company can set various goals with its employees. In the case of a call center, an MBO could be to increase customer satisfaction, say, by 10%, while reducing call times by one minute. The onus is now on finding ways to achieve this goal. Once that’s decided on, it’s important to get employees on board and then monitor their progress, provide feedback, and reward those who do a good job.




What are some drawbacks of using MBO?
As MBO is entirely focused on goals and targets, it often ignores other parts of a company, such as the corporate culture, worker conduct, a healthy work ethos, environmental issues, and areas for involvement and contribution to the community and social good.




What is the difference between MBO and management by exception (MBE)?
In management by exception (MBE), management only addresses instances where objectives or standards are transgressed. Thus, workers are left alone until and unless proficiency is not met.


   The Bottom Line  

As a theory, MBO makes a lot of sense: Help employees to get involved in setting company goals and they are more likely to share management’s objectives, work harder, and deliver.



However, there’s also a good reason why MBO is widely criticized. Like most things that look good on paper, it doesn’t always work in practice. The key is to be aware of its drawbacks, customize the plan according to your organization, and make sure that everyone is fully on board and that the objectives are clear and reasonable before commencing.
What Is Management Discussion and Analysis (MD&A)?  

Management discussion and analysis (MD&A) is a section of a public company's annual report or quarterly filing. The MD&A addresses the company’s performance. In this section, the company’s management and executives, also known as the C-suite, present an analysis of the company’s performance with qualitative and quantitative measures.





Key Takeaways

Management discussion and analysis (MD&A) is a section within a company’s annual report or quarterly filing where executives analyze the company’s performance.The section can also include a discussion of compliance, risks, and future plans, such as goals and new projects.The MD&A section is not audited and represents the thoughts and opinions of management.Companies often use the MD&A section to invoke confidence in investors by explain how and why future plans of the company will be successful.However, the MD&A section is less helpful as management does not want to reveal too much of its forward-looking plans in a publicly-availably, required filing.












Investopedia / Eliana Rodgers


   Understanding Management Discussion and Analysis (MD&A)  

In the management discussion and analysis (MD&A) section of the annual report, management provides commentary on financial statements, systems and controls, compliance with laws and regulations, and actions it has planned or has taken to address any challenges the company is facing. Management also discusses the upcoming year by outlining future goals and approaches to new projects. The MD&A is an important source of information for analysts and investors who want to review the company’s financial fundamentals and management performance.



The MD&A is just one of many sections required by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) to be included in a public company’s annual report to shareholders. A company that issues stock or bonds to the public at large must register its offerings with the SEC, which oversees public companies’ compliance with U.S. securities laws and ensures investors are given adequate information about companies they invest in. The SEC mandates 14 items to be included in the 10-K report. The MD&A section is Item #7.



The FASB is a nonprofit, private regulatory organization, which the SEC has designated as the body responsible for promulgating accounting standards for public companies in the United States. FASB outlines its requirements for the MD&A section of filings.


  Requirements for Management Discussion and Analysis (MD&A)  

Securities law dictates that companies must hire an independent auditor to verify a company’s financial statements, such as its balance sheet, income statements, and statement of cash flows. Auditors perform test work to determine if the financial statements are materially correct, but these certified public accountants (CPAs) do not audit the MD&A section. The MD&A represents the thoughts and opinions of management and provides a forecast of future operations. Therefore, these statements can’t typically be authenticated.






The MD&A section is not audited and includes the opinions of management.



That said, the MD&A section must meet certain standards. According to FASB, “MD&A should provide a balanced presentation that includes both positive and negative information about the topics discussed.” Even if management is giving its opinion on the state of its business, competition, and risks, these statements must be based on fact, and there must be an attempt to paint a balanced picture of the company’s future prospects.


   What Is Covered in MD&A?  

The MD&A section often includes an "Overview and Outlook" section. This part of the financial statement is used to explain what the future of the organization looks like. It is also management's opportunity to explain why variances (both positive or negative) occurred and what they expect from the market.



Next, management also typically discusses liquidity, solvency, and capital resources. Management must identify trends, demands, or long-term commitments that may strain capital. This section also usually contains information about management's future plans for material, major capital expenditures.



Management uses this section to explain the results of operations. Management can explain unusual events, material transactions, or significant economic changes. The company often uses this opportunity to explain why net revenues and expenses varied from expected or budgeted financial plans. The company may also use this section to explain its successes, such as how a specific product outperformed during its new launch or how new markets have beat expectations.



Last, this section is often used to shine light on management's estimates used for accounting practices. Some accounting rules require professional judgement; management can explain why they valued capital assets, inventory, or other assets as a certain amount. It can also explain how it arrived at estimates for other balance sheet or income statement amounts, such as an allowance for bad debt and resulting bad debt expense.






The MD&A section is usually buried in the notes to the financial statements; these notes are located after the financial statements.


   Limitations of MD&A  

The MD&A section of a 10-K primarily uses words to explain a financial position instead of numbers. Therefore, management can use soft or hard language to manipulate how financial performance has been going or is expected to occur. Whereas financial reporting via generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) have strict rules, a company can choose how to represent itself using the MD&A section.



When management prepares this section, they are aware that this information is going to be publicly available. This means that competitors will be able to extract information on the company's strategy. Therefore, in addition to wanting to paint a rosy picture, the company wants to be as secretive as possible without revealing information that could take away its competitive advantage.



Last, the MD&A section is entirely up to management interpretation. This means a company may interpret data one way, when in reality the markets will play out an entirely differently way. Even if management puts forth a projection to the best of its knowledge, its analysis is still prone to error and may not materialize.


   Example of MD&A  

The images below are from Amazon's 2021 10-K filing. In Item 7 of the notes to its financial statements, the company provides a forward-looking projection of what's to come for the company. You'll note that to protect intellectual property and not reveal too many strategic plans, the wording in this section is a bit vague.















Amazon, 2021 Financial Statements (MD&A).



Next, Amazon provides an overview of operations. This includes the primary sources of income, its strategic financial focus, and other means of success. Again, the company provides some insights into operations without revealing too many strategies that companies can directly steal.















Amazon, 2021 Financial Statements (MD&A).



There are other sections after the critical accounting judgements section, but this is the last example shown here. This section confirms that the financial statements have been prepared in conformance with GAAP and explains how management arrived at certain estimates.















Amazon, 2021 Financial Statements (MD&A).




Is Management Discussion and Analysis Part of the Financial Statements?
Yes, the MD&A section is a part of a company's publicly issued financial statements. This information is included in the notes to the financial statements, often indicated as note #7.




Is MD&A Mandatory?
Yes, the MD&A section is a standard piece to a set of financial statements. The notes section of the financial statements must include certain pieces of information, with the MD&A section being one of them.




What Is the Purpose of Management Discussion and Analysis?
The purpose of management discussion and analysis is to shed more light on how the financial statements were prepared, how the company performed, and what the company expects for the future. It's management's opportunity to explain in their own words about the financial position and strategy of the company. It's purpose is usually not only to reassure investors of its financial health but to convey its financial strategy to promote confidence.




Why Is the Management Discussion & Analysis Section Important?
The MD&A section is important because it doesn't have as restrictive guidelines compared to the numerically-prepared financial statements. Management can use its own wording to explain unusual events or material considerations. It can also explain its future plans which are not conveyed in backwards-looking financial statements.


   The Bottom Line  

The management discussion and analysis section of a set of financial statements is management's opportunity to explain how the company did and how it will perform. The section is buried in the notes to the financial statements, and it usually contains an overview, forward-looking projection, and explanation of management's judgements.
What Is a Management Fee?  

A management fee is a charge levied by an investment manager for managing an investment fund. The management fee is intended to compensate the managers for their time and expertise for selecting stocks and managing the portfolio. It can also include other items such as investor relations (IR) expenses and the administration costs of the fund.





Key Takeaways

Management fees are the cost of having an investment fund professionally managed by an investment manager. The management fees cover not only the cost of paying the managers but also the costs of investor relations and any administrative costs.Fee structures are usually based on a percentage of assets under management (AUM); they tend to range from 0.10% to more than 2% of AUM.


   Management Fee Explained  

The management fee is the cost of having your assets professionally managed. The fee compensates professional money managers to select securities for a fund’s portfolio and manage it based on the fund’s investment objective. Management fee structures vary from fund to fund, but they are typically based on a percentage of assets under management (AUM). For example, a mutual fund's management fee could be stated as 0.5% of assets under management.


   Wide Disparity in Management Fees  

Management fees can range from as low as 0.10% to more than 2% of AUM. This disparity in the fees charged is generally attributed to the investment method used by the fund’s manager. The more actively managed a fund is, the higher the management fees that are charged. For example, an aggressive stock fund that turns over its portfolio several times a year in search of profit opportunities costs much more to manage than a more passively managed fund, such as an index fund that more or less sits on a basket of stocks without much trading.






Actively-managed funds generally result in higher management fees than those that are more passively-managed, however, actively-managed funds don't necessarily see better returns than those of passively-managed funds and in some cases, see worse returns.


   Are High Management Fees Worth the Cost?  

Active fund managers rely on inefficiencies and mispricing in the market to identify stocks that have the potential to outperform the market. However, the efficient market hypothesis (EMH) has shown that stock prices fully reflect all available information and expectations, so current prices are the best approximation of a company’s intrinsic value. This would preclude anyone from exploiting mispriced stocks on a consistent basis because price movements are largely random and driven by unforeseen events. Therefore, the EMH implies that no active investor can consistently beat the market over long periods of time except by chance. According to decades of Morningstar research, higher-cost actively managed funds do tend to underperform lower-cost passively managed funds in all categories.



Research by Nobel laureate William Sharpe has shown that “After costs, the return on the average actively managed dollar will be less than the return on the average passively managed dollar for any time period.”﻿﻿ Sharpe concluded that active fund managers underperform passive fund managers, not because of any flaw in their strategies, but because of the laws of arithmetic. In order for active fund managers to beat the market by just 1%, they would need to achieve an excess return of more than 2% just to account for the average 1.19% percent management fee.


   Hedge Fund Management Fees  

Hedge funds charge notoriously high fees that have become controversial as performance has often lagged the market. Their fee structure is commonly referred to as "two and twenty" because it consists of a flat 2% of total asset value and 20% of all profits earned. Though the plan is often criticized, it has been the norm since Alfred Winslow Jones founded what is often considered the first hedge fund, AW Jones & Co., in 1949. As competition has increased and investors have become discontent, the standard has come under pressure, causing managers to often implement lower fees, performance hurdles, and clawbacks if performance is not met.
What Is Managerial Accounting?  

Managerial accounting is the practice of identifying, measuring, analyzing, interpreting, and communicating financial information to managers for the pursuit of an organization's goals.



Managerial accounting differs from financial accounting because the intended purpose of managerial accounting is to assist users internal to the company in making well-informed business decisions.





Key Takeaways

Managerial accounting involves the presentation of financial information for internal purposes to be used by management in making key business decisions.Techniques used by managerial accountants are not dictated by accounting standards, unlike financial accounting.The presentation of managerial accounting data can be modified to meet the specific needs of its end-user.Managerial accounting encompasses many facets of accounting, including product costing, budgeting, forecasting, and various financial analysis.This differs from financial accounting, which produces and disseminates official financial statements for public consumption that conform to prevailing accounting standards.

   How Managerial Accounting Works  

Managerial accounting encompasses many facets of accounting aimed at improving the quality of information delivered to management about business operation metrics. Managerial accountants use information relating to the cost and sales revenue of goods and services generated by the company. Cost accounting is a large subset of managerial accounting that specifically focuses on capturing a company's total costs of production by assessing the variable costs of each step of production, as well as fixed costs. It allows businesses to identify and reduce unnecessary spending and maximize profits.


   Managerial Accounting vs. Financial Accounting  

The key difference between managerial accounting and financial accounting relates to the intended users of the information. Managerial accounting information is aimed at helping managers within the organization make well-informed business decisions, while financial accounting is aimed at providing financial information to parties outside the organization.



Financial accounting must conform to certain standards, such as generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). All publicly held companies are required to complete their financial statements in accordance with GAAP as a requisite for maintaining their publicly traded status. Most other companies in the U.S. conform to GAAP in order to meet debt covenants often required by financial institutions offering lines of credit.



Because managerial accounting is not for external users, it can be modified to meet the needs of its intended users. This may vary considerably by company or even by department within a company. For example, managers in the production department may want to see their financial information displayed as a percentage of units produced in the period. The HR department manager may be interested in seeing a graph of salaries by employee over a period of time. Managerial accounting is able to meet the needs of both departments by offering information in whatever format is most beneficial to that specific need.


   Types of Managerial Accounting  
  Product Costing and Valuation  

Product costing deals with determining the total costs involved in the production of a good or service. Costs may be broken down into subcategories, such as variable, fixed, direct, or indirect costs. Cost accounting is used to measure and identify those costs, in addition to assigning overhead to each type of product created by the company.



Managerial accountants calculate and allocate overhead charges to assess the full expense related to the production of a good. The overhead expenses may be allocated based on the number of goods produced or other activity drivers related to production, such as the square footage of the facility. In conjunction with overhead costs, managerial accountants use direct costs to properly value the cost of goods sold and inventory that may be in different stages of production.



Marginal costing (sometimes called cost-volume-profit analysis) is the impact on the cost of a product by adding one additional unit into production. It is useful for short-term economic decisions. The contribution margin of a specific product is its impact on the overall profit of the company. Margin analysis flows into break-even analysis, which involves calculating the contribution margin on the sales mix to determine the unit volume at which the business’s gross sales equal total expenses. Break-even point analysis is useful for determining price points for products and services.


  Cash Flow Analysis  

Managerial accountants perform cash flow analysis in order to determine the cash impact of business decisions. Most companies record their financial information on the accrual basis of accounting. Although accrual accounting provides a more accurate picture of a company's true financial position, it also makes it harder to see the true cash impact of a single financial transaction. A managerial accountant may implement working capital management strategies in order to optimize cash flow and ensure the company has enough liquid assets to cover short-term obligations.



When a managerial accountant performs cash flow analysis, he will consider the cash inflow or outflow generated as a result of a specific business decision. For example, if a department manager is considering purchasing a company vehicle, he may have the option to either buy the vehicle outright or get a loan. A managerial accountant may run different scenarios by the department manager depicting the cash outlay required to purchase outright upfront versus the cash outlay over time with a loan at various interest rates.


  Inventory Turnover Analysis  

Inventory turnover is a calculation of how many times a company has sold and replaced inventory in a given time period. Calculating inventory turnover can help businesses make better decisions on pricing, manufacturing, marketing, and purchasing new inventory. A managerial accountant may identify the carrying cost of inventory, which is the amount of expense a company incurs to store unsold items.



If the company is carrying an excessive amount of inventory, there could be efficiency improvements made to reduce storage costs and free up cash flow for other business purposes.


  Constraint Analysis  

Managerial accounting also involves reviewing the constraints within a production line or sales process. Managerial accountants help determine where bottlenecks occur and calculate the impact of these constraints on revenue, profit, and cash flow. Managers can then use this information to implement changes and improve efficiencies in the production or sales process.


  Financial Leverage Metrics  

Financial leverage refers to a company's use of borrowed capital in order to acquire assets and increase its return on investments. Through balance sheet analysis, managerial accountants can provide management with the tools they need to study the company's debt and equity mix in order to put leverage to its most optimal use.



Performance measures such as return on equity, debt to equity, and return on invested capital help management identify key information about borrowed capital, prior to relaying these statistics to outside sources. It is important for management to review ratios and statistics regularly to be able to appropriately answer questions from its board of directors, investors, and creditors.


  Accounts Receivable (AR) Management  

Appropriately managing accounts receivable (AR) can have positive effects on a company's bottom line. An accounts receivable aging report categorizes AR invoices by the length of time they have been outstanding. For example, an AR aging report may list all outstanding receivables less than 30 days, 30 to 60 days, 60 to 90 days, and 90+ days.



Through a review of outstanding receivables, managerial accountants can indicate to appropriate department managers if certain customers are becoming credit risks. If a customer routinely pays late, management may reconsider doing any future business on credit with that customer.


  Budgeting, Trend Analysis, and Forecasting  

Budgets are extensively used as a quantitative expression of the company's plan of operation. Managerial accountants utilize performance reports to note deviations of actual results from budgets. The positive or negative deviations from a budget also referred to as budget-to-actual variances, are analyzed in order to make appropriate changes going forward.



Managerial accountants analyze and relay information related to capital expenditure decisions. This includes the use of standard capital budgeting metrics, such as net present value and internal rate of return, to assist decision-makers on whether to embark on capital-intensive projects or purchases. Managerial accounting involves examining proposals, deciding if the products or services are needed, and finding the appropriate way to finance the purchase. It also outlines payback periods so management is able to anticipate future economic benefits.



Managerial accounting also involves reviewing the trendline for certain expenses and investigating unusual variances or deviations. It is important to review this information regularly because expenses that vary considerably from what is typically expected are commonly questioned during external financial audits. This field of accounting also utilizes previous period information to calculate and project future financial information. This may include the use of historical pricing, sales volumes, geographical locations, customer tendencies, or financial information.




Is Financial Accounting the Same as Managerial Accounting?
While they often perform similar tasks, financial accounting is the process of preparing and presenting official quarterly or annual financial information for external use. Such reports may include audited financial statements that help investors and analysts decide whether to buy or sell shares of the company. Because of this managerial accounting in the U.S. must adhere to GAAP standards.Managerial accounting, in contrast, uses pro forma measures that describe and measure the financial information tracked internally by corporate managers.




Do Managerial Accountants Need to Follow GAAP?
No, managerial accountants are not legally obligated to follow GAAP because the documents they produce are not regulated by GAAP. These documents focus on internal company metrics that focus on company performance.




What Types of Information Does Managerial Accounting Compute?
Managerial accounting is useful for companies to track and craft spending budgets, reduce costs, project sales figures, and manage cash flows, among other tasks.




What Are the 3 Pillars of Managerial Accounting?
Managerial accounting is used for planning, decision-making, and controlling. These are the three pillars of the field. In addition, forecasting and performance tracking are key components.


   The Bottom Line  

Managerial accounting is important for drafting accurate and complete financial statements for internal use and crafting a company's long-term strategy. Without good managerial accounting, corporate leadership can struggle to make appropriate choices or misunderstand the firm's true financial picture. Because managerial accounting documents are not official, they do not have to conform to GAAP and can be used internally for a variety of purposes.
What Is the Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price (MSRP)?  

The manufacturer’s suggested retail price (MSRP) is the price that a product's manufacturer recommends it be sold for at the point of sale. Any retail product can have an MSRP, but the term is frequently used with automobiles. An MSRP is sometimes informally known as the "sticker price."



The MSRP is also referred to as the list price by some retailers. Other higher-priced goods, such as appliances and electronics, may have an MSRP as well.



The MSRP is designed to keep prices at the same level from store to store. But retailers are not required to use this price, and consumers do not always pay the MSRP when they make purchases. Items may be sold for a lower price so a company can reasonably move inventory off shelves, especially in a sluggish economy.





Key Takeaways

The manufacturer’s suggested retail price (MSRP) is the sticker price recommended by a product's producer to retailers.They are frequently used in the sale of automobiles, although most retail products come with an MSRP.MSRP is different from the invoice price, the price a dealer or retailer pays a manufacturer.Many retailers will sell products below the MSRP to reduce inventory, attract more consumers, or during a sluggish economy.Conversely, some retailers will set prices higher than the MSRP for products in high demand.












Investopedia / Sydney Saporito


   Understanding the Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price (MSRP)  

The manufacturer's suggested retail price is sometimes referred to as the recommended retail price (RRP), sticker price, list price, or suggested retail price of products. This was developed to help standardize the price of goods throughout the various locations of a company’s stores.



Some retailers sell products at or just below the MSRP. They may set the price lower if the product is on sale or has been moved to clearance. They may also reduce prices if they're trying to reduce their inventories or they're trying to attract more consumers. Conversely, stores may set prices higher than the MSRP if a product is in high demand and is likely to sell quickly.



The automotive industry frequently uses MSRP to set the prices of new vehicles. Legally, car dealerships must display the price on a sticker on the car’s windshield or on a spec sheet. Buyers can use this price as a point to start negotiations before arriving at a fair price for the vehicle.






Car dealers pay manufacturers an invoice price that is at or just below the MSRP and knowing this price can help consumers better negotiate with a salesperson.


   How MSRPs Are Determined  

Because the MSRP is set by a product’s manufacturer, it should remain constant across retailers. The MSRP is supposed to reflect all the costs incurred over the manufacturing and sales process, as well as an average markup by retailers. Prices are set to allow all parties involved—the manufacturer, wholesaler, and retailer—to make a profit from the final sale.



Retailers may frequently charge less than the MSRP, but the price charged depends on the wholesale cost, whether purchased in bulk from the manufacturer or in smaller quantities through a distributor. In many instances, the MSRP is manipulated to an unreasonably high figure. Retailers do this so they can deceptively advertise a product and list it at a much lower sale price, indicating to consumers that they're getting a much better bargain.


   Problems With MSRP  

Using suggested pricing methods often falls into direct conflict with competition theory. The use of the MSRP allows a manufacturer to set the price of a product, often higher than usual, with the potential for having an adverse effect on consumers and their wallets.



Another suggested pricing method is resale price maintenance (RPM), where retailers are required to price products at or above a certain level. This practice is frowned upon or illegal in many regions of the world.


   MSRP vs. Base Price vs. Invoice Price  

An MSRP is a recommended price by a manufacturer. Although it is intended to give a retailer a margin of profit, there is no obligation for retailers to sell a car at the MSRP. Retailers may set their official prices higher or lower than the MSRP, depending on inventory or market conditions.



The MSRP is different from the invoice price, the price that the dealer pays the manufacturer for each car. This is typically lower than the MSRP, allowing the dealer to earn a profit on each sale. Since the dealer is required to pay the invoice price, they will be losing money if they sell to the customer at a lower price.



The base price represents the cost of a car, without any optional features. Many car models come with additional features, such as cruise control, internal cameras, or optional safety features. Each of these features represents an additional charge which is added to the base price.




How Much Below the MSRP Can I Pay?
Although prices are negotiable, the discount you can receive will depend on the dealer's inventory and market conditions. For older vehicles, you may be able to get a substantial discount from the MSRP, especially if the dealer is trying to free up inventory for the latest models. For the most popular models, you might end up paying even more than the MSRP.




How Do You Negotiate Against the MSRP?
The best way to negotiate with a car dealer is to find out the invoice price of the car you are looking at. This is the cost that the dealer pays to the manufacturer for each car. You should also try to find out if there are any rebates, subsidized lease deals, or other breaks that can reduce the value of the car. This allows you to bargain for a discount that still allows the dealer to make money. A final price of 2% higher than the invoice price is generally considered a good deal.




Does the MSRP Include the Destination Fee?
The Destination fee, or destination charge, is a special charge for the cost of delivering a vehicle to a customer or dealer. This fee is not included in the MSRP of the vehicle, and it is usually non-negotiable, even if the buyer takes delivery at the factory.


   The Bottom Line  

The manufacturer's suggested retail price, also known as the window price or sticker price, is the suggested price of buying a vehicle or other high-priced item. As the name implies, the MSRP is only a suggestion: Dealers are free to sell for higher or lower prices if they wish. Cautious buyers can negotiate for a better price, especially if they do their research first.
What Is Manufacturing?  

The term manufacturing refers to the processing of raw materials or parts into finished goods through the use of tools, human labor, machinery, and chemical processing.



Manufacturing allows businesses to sell finished products at a higher cost than the value of the raw materials used. Large-scale manufacturing allows for goods to be mass-produced using assembly line processes and advanced technologies as core assets. Efficient manufacturing techniques enable manufacturers to take advantage of economies of scale, producing more units at a lower cost.





Key Takeaways

Manufacturing is the process of turning raw materials or parts into finished goods through the use of tools, human labor, machinery, and chemical processing.Most products were handmade using human labor and basic tools before the Industrial Revolution.The Industrial Revolution led to mass production, assembly line manufacturing, and the use of mechanization to manufacture larger quantities of goods at a lower cost.Financial analysts study the ISM Manufacturing Report each month as a potential early indicator of the economy's health and where the stock market might be headed.Manufacturing can be defined and classified under different types, processes, or techniques.


   Understanding Manufacturing  

Manufacturing is an integral and huge part of the economy. It involves the processing and refinement of raw materials, such as ore, wood, and foodstuffs, into finished products, such as metal goods, furniture, and processed foods.



Converting these raw materials into something more useful adds value. This added value increases the price of finished products, making manufacturing a very profitable part of the business chain. Some people specialize in the skills required to manufacture goods, while others provide the funds that businesses need to purchase the tools and materials.



As noted above, efficiency in manufacturing can lead to higher productivity and cost savings. Manufacturers are able to accomplish this if they are able to:



Reduce redundancies
Improve the quality of work
Update equipment and procedures
Set realistic goals
Streamline intake, supply chain, and distribution channels






Manufacturing is often reported on by the conference board and is well examined by economists.


   Types of Manufacturing  

How products are manufactured has changed over time. People have historically manufactured goods using raw materials. And in certain cases, they still do. Hand manufacturing involves the use of basic tools through more traditional processes. This form of manufacturing is often associated with decorative art, textile production, leatherwork, carpentry, and some metalwork.



Handmade goods are labor-intensive and require a lot of time. In some cases, they can command a high price, depending on the supplier and the type of goods. For instance, one-of-a-kind handmade fashion items can be sold at a higher price compared to something mass-produced. There are cases, though, where people who make goods using these techniques can be exploited, especially where labor laws are lax and demand for jobs is high.



Larger businesses use mechanization to mass-produce items on a much grander scale. This process involves the use of machines, which means that the manual manipulation of materials isn't necessarily required. Very little human capital is needed in the production process, although highly skilled individuals may be required to operate and ensure that machinery is running properly.


  Additive Manufacturing  

This type of manufacturing is commonly referred to as 3D printing. It involves the use of layers that are built up upon each other to create shapes and patterns in a three-dimensional process using a special piece of equipment, such as a 3D printer.


  Advanced Manufacturing  

This method involves new forms of technology to improve the production process. Companies can add even more value to the raw materials they use to better serve their target markets. Newer technologies also help bring new products to market faster while increasing output.


  Contract Manufacturing  

This is common in the manufacturing industry. Companies will enter into partnerships and business relationships with other firms to outsource certain manufacturing processes. For example, an automotive company may hire a third party to make parts that it will use in its assembly lines to make cars.






3D printing has been around since the 1980s.


   Types of Manufacturing Techniques  
  Make to Stock (MTS)  

The traditional production technique is make-to-stock, the manufacturing of a standard product based on forecast demand. A company estimates how many units will be sold over a given period of time, then plan in advance to manufacture that many goods. Goods are often held as inventory leading up to the release and broad distribution of the goods.



A company must have sufficient information in advance of a product release to understand how many goods it will need to manufacture. This includes using historical data from similar goods, understanding macroeconomic conditions, and considering customer expectations for specific product features.



The advantage of MTS is companies can often capitalize on scales of economy. Because a company sets a target level of manufacturing, it can plan in advance how much raw materials, labor, or equipment it will need and can often build the most robust manufacturing plans. On the downside, not meeting expectation leaves a company with unusable product, surplus inventory, and committed yet underutilized fixed costs.


  Make to Order (MTO)  

Opposite of MTS, make-to-order manufacturing entails working directly with a customer to understand their need and desired product specifications. Manufacturing typically only starts after a signed contract or letter of intent. In addition, manufacturers may generate light prototypes but will often hold off on starting manufacturing until full product specifications have been delivered.



MTO is most common in industries where specialized products are being made for a very specific purpose. Aerospace, construction, or technology (to a lesser degree) are examples of industries where manufacturers will often not manufacture a good until a government entity has agreed to purchase the aircraft or a tenant has signed a long-term lease agreement.



On one hand, MTO manufacturers can often charge a premium for their products as the good may not be easily acquired in a marketplace. This is especially true for highly-specified goods. In addition, MTO manufacturers often only make a good if a sale is lined up; therefore, it often never carries inventory. As a downside, MTO manufacturing often comes with uneven product demand that may result in slower periods of business.


  Make to Assemble (MTA)  

The third type of manufacturing technique is a make-to-assemble process. Companies try to get a head start by starting production on component parts. Then, as customers begin to place orders, companies assemble previously-manufactured components.



Because the company had partially completed the manufacturing process, the good can often be delivered faster to customers than under MTO processes. However, the company still runs the risk of being stuck with an inventory of forecast demand that does not materialize. In addition, the company risks losing the benefits of MTO and MTS by trying to balance each type of process.


   Types of Manufacturing Processes  

Finally, manufacturing can be divided into different production methods. Each method results in a uniquely different end product.


  Discrete Manufacturing  

Discrete manufacturing is aptly named because each product manufactured can be specifically identified. The manufacturing process leverages a bill of materials to track what raw materials or components go into each specific unit. In discrete manufacturing processes, units are often made on a production line where assembly line workers follow a production schedule and record material usage.


  Process Manufacturing  

There are two main types of process manufacturing. First, batch process manufacturing entails manufacturing a product based on a specific standard that uses a recipe or formula. Batch process manufacturing is often used in the food and beverage industry to make easily replicable goods of a specific quantity (i.e. a specific vessel of teriyaki sauce).



Alternatively, continuous process manufacturing entails consistent, ongoing operations that often manufacture a good around the click for a long period. Then, manufacturing is halted for a period of time before being resumed. Continuous process manufacturing is heavily used in the oil and gas industry when drilling for natural resources.


  Mixed Mode Manufacturing  

Some goods may entail a combination of both discrete and manufacturing processes. This is often the case for goods manufactured using batch process before these standardized goods are converted to more specific individual package. The initial stage to generate a product uses process manufacturing, while the unique specifics of the delivery method (including any customer customizations) are added in the second half.


  Job Shop Manufacturing  

An even more specific type of manufacturing process, goods can be manufactured using job shop manufacturing. This process is most often used when there is a batch to process yet the batch is different than a company's normal product. For this specialized, customized good, a company must often perform unique set-up and process steps including converting existing equipment to a more usable structure.


  Repetitive Manufacturing  

A potential subset of other manufacturing processes, repetitive manufacturing often breaks long manufacturing processes into smaller parts. Each part, often called a dedicated assembly line or manufacturing cell, is intended to manufacture only their specific part of the unit. Then, units are continuously transferred to the next subsequent dedicated assembly line. Any work in material resides within the manufacturing line as temporary storage areas are often not used.






In 2021, an estimated 12.1 million Americans work in the manufacturing sector.


   History of Modern Manufacturing  

Handmade products dominated the market before the Industrial Revolution. This period ushered in the industrial process, where raw materials were made into finished products in high volumes. The development of steam engines and newer technologies allowed companies to use machines in the manufacturing process. This reduced the need for human capital while increasing the sheer volume of goods that could be produced.



Mass production and assembly line manufacturing allowed companies to create parts that could be used interchangeably and allowed finished products to be easily made by reducing the need for part customization. Ford popularized mass-production techniques in the early 20th century.



Computers and precision electronic equipment have since allowed companies to pioneer high-tech manufacturing methods. Companies that use these methods typically carry a higher price but also require more specialized labor and higher capital investment.



The skills required to operate machines and develop manufacturing processes have drastically changed over time. Many low-skill manufacturing jobs have shifted from developed to developing countries because labor in developing countries tends to be less expensive. As such, high-end products that require precision and skilled manufacturing are typically produced in developed economies.


   Measuring Manufacturing in the Economy  

Economists and government statisticians use various ratios when evaluating the role manufacturing plays in the economy. For example, manufacturing value added (MVA) is an indicator that compares an economy's manufacturing output to its overall size. This metric is expressed as a percentage of gross domestic product (GDP).



The Institute for Supply Management (ISM) surveys manufacturing firms to estimate employment, inventories, and new orders. The ISM publishes the ISM Manufacturing Report each month to summarize its findings. Financial analysts and researchers eagerly await this report as they see it as a potential early indicator of the economy's health as well as a sign of where the stock market may be going.





$2.2 Trillion

Manufacturing has always been a key contributor to the United States economy. It's estimated that 10.8% of the U.S. GDP in 2020 was contributed to manufacturing. This was equal to a little over $2.2 trillion.


   Steps of Manufacturing  

These seven steps, following in sequential order, encompass not only the physical manufacturing of a good but the stages before and after a tangible good is made.


  Step 1: Develop the Idea  

Before any tangible good is made, manufacturing begins with concept development and the growth of the product vision. This product vision defines what the product is, who the target audience is, what the need for the good is, and what competitors exist. Many of these types of questions may define the good and help refine what characteristics will go into the actual product.


  Step 2: Perform Market Research  

Though many believe manufacturing only entails the physical aspect of making a good, the manufacturing process still incorporates researching the potential product to explore ways to make it better. This includes understanding what raw materials can be used, what equipment is needed, what conditions the good must be made under, and how the good will differentiate from competing goods.


  Step 3: Design the Product  

With research considerations in-hand, it's time to design the product. This should always be done in consideration of what the customer will need and use. This also should incorporate any manufacturing limitations discovered during the research stage. This also includes understanding the costs that will go into this product design so you can forecast what your product profitability will be. It is during this stage that the manufacturing process is most deeply rooted in research and development.


  Step 4: Finalize and Prototype  

With the design stage now complete, it's time to make final decisions on what the product will be. This includes making choices of what raw materials to use or how to define the manufacturing process. These decisions are implemented by creating an initial prototype. This means drafting a smaller-scale test product that mirrors what the true manufacturing product will be.


  Step 5: Prototype Testing  

Once the prototype is complete, it's time to test it. This includes analyzing actual resources that went into the good to better understand how much the actual product will cost and what its profit margin will be. This also includes finding weaknesses or inefficiencies in the manufacturing process. This is often the final stage before mass production begins; though changes can be made in the future, this is the time for big changes to be made without major implications on the product or manufacturing process.


  Step 6: Manufacture the Good  

Enough time, testing, and research has been done; it's now time to make the good. The company acquires the machinery and equipment necessary to make full-scale processes to manufacture the good. The company also invests in the full amount of labor, storage, insurance, and other costs related to a full manufacturing line.



Companies may choose to continually improve their processes; instead of returning back to prototype stages, they often review and implement smaller changes during the actual manufacturing step.


  Step 7: Monitor the Process  

In order to continually improve, the company must continually evaluate how the process is going and whether expectations are being met. The company must analyze how much the good costs to make and compare this against sale prices. The company must also evaluate product demand and scale up (or scale down) based on consumer preference.


   Manufacturing vs. Production  

Though sometimes referred to as the same thing, there are subtle differences between the manufacturing process and the production process. In manufacturing, a company must often solicit raw materials from third-party or external vendors to be processed into finished goods. For production, the company often has ownership of those raw materials.



The definition of each encompasses different processes. Production is broader and encompasses manufacturing, as production is simply taking input and yielding an output. Manufacturing, a more specific type of production, is the act of taking a raw material and transforming it into a tangible finished good.



The manufacturing process ends with a tangible good. Alternatively, production can end with a tangible or intangible good. Consider the theatrical example that is aptly named. A show or theater production literally ends with public entertainment to be consumed by the general public.



Because the manufacturing process is heavily reliant on raw materials, the manufacturing process often relies on heavy machinery or equipment. It also relies on set-up time and labor to establish the process. During production, machinery may not be required depending on the output.





Manufacturing

Often requires procurement of a raw material
Output is physical, tangible goods
Machinery and labor are essential to the process
Is a more specific type of process



Production

Often entails previous ownership of the inputs for the process
Output may be tangible or intangible good
Machinery may or may not be required
Is a less specific type of process





   Example of Manufacturing  

Known for its efficient manufacturing process, Toyota Motor Corporation is a historically well-known and successful manufacturer. The company uses a lean manufacturing system to produce vehicle order by customers in the quickest and most efficient way possible. At the end of 2021, Toyota announced it was increasing its long-term forecast of battery electric vehicle sales, planning for 3.5 million units sold in 2030 (up from the previous plan of 2.0 million).



The company's manufacturing process is based on two core concepts:



Jidoka: When there is a production issue, the equipment stops immediately to prevent future defective products.Just-in-Time: Each process manufactures only what is essential for the current process. This includes sourcing just enough material without carrying excessive amounts of reserves.



Under jidoka, engineers design and build systems by hand to intricately understand the manufacturing process. Then, they carefully simplify operations and transition to leveraging machines. The goal is for the manufacturing process to leverage repetitive processes that make the manufacturing process more simple and less expensive.



Under just-in-time, Toyota strives to eliminate "waste, inconsistencies, and unreasonable requirements on the production line". When an order is received, the production instructions must go to the manufacturing line immediately. The manufacturing line must have the required materials and parts available. Any deficiencies are quickly resolved by swapping similar parts.




What Is Lean Manufacturing?
Lean manufacturing is a form production that can be used by manufacturers that want to reduce production system time in order to increase their efficiency. Implementing a lean manufacturing approach means that a company wants to boost productivity while eliminating as much waste as possible. This could mean cutting back on operating costs and lead times.




How Do You Calculate Manufacturing Overhead?
Manufacturing overhead is the total indirect cost associated with manufacturing. This includes any expenses like employee wages, asset depreciation, rent, leases, and utilities. Costs like materials are not included.In order to calculate your manufacturing overhead, take your monthly overhead expenses and divide that total by your monthly sales. You can multiply the result by 100 to get the total percent of monthly overhead.




What Is the Purpose of Manufacturing?
Manufacturing is the process of converting a raw material into a finished, tangible product. Manufacturing entails making a process efficient as it converts specific resources into a different resource, often for the purpose of being sold to a customer.




What Are the Steps of Manufacturing?
The manufacturing process often begins with an information-gathering stage where engineers and management learn about a process. Prototypes are often created and evaluated. Then, specific designs are implemented, and commercial production begins. As goods are made, they are inspected, shipped, and delivered to the next user of the finished good.




Why Is Manufacturing Important?
Manufacturing is critical for most, if not all, of the goods around you. Without a formal process to convert raw materials into more complex goods, we would be without electronics, appliances, transportation, and many facets of life that make our days more efficient, safe, and productive. Manufacturing is the backbone of the items we interact with, rely on, enjoy, and consume.


   The Bottom Line  

Humans have traditionally turned raw materials into finished goods for as long as we can remember. This process, which converts raw materials into finished goods, is called manufacturing. Businesses can still use human labor to convert these materials by hand. But they now also have the option to purchase machinery to mass-produce goods on a much larger scale. Technology has helped the way we manufacture our goods and continues to evolve. The advent of 3D printing is making it easier for individuals to produce finished goods themselves, without ever leaving their own homes.
What Is Manufacturing Resource Planning?  

Manufacturing Resource Planning (MRP II) is an integrated information system used by businesses. Manufacturing Resource Planning (MRP II) evolved from early Materials Requirement Planning (MRP) systems by including the integration of additional data, such as employee and financial needs.



The system is designed to centralize, integrate, and process information for effective decision making in scheduling, design engineering, inventory management, and cost control in manufacturing.



Both MRP and MRP II are seen as predecessors to Enterprise resource planning (ERP), which is a process whereby a company, often a manufacturer, manages and integrates the important parts of its business.



An ERP management information system integrates areas such as planning, purchasing, inventory, sales, marketing, finance, and human resources. ERP is most frequently used in the context of software, with many large applications having been developed to help companies implement ERP.


   Understanding Manufacturing Resource Planning (MRP II)  

MRP II is a computer-based system that can create detailed production schedules using real-time data to coordinate the arrival of component materials with machine and labor availability. MRP II is used widely by itself, but it's also used as a module of more extensive enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems.





Key Takeaways

Manufacturing Resource Planning (MRP II) is an integrated information system used by businesses.MRP II is an extension of materials requirement planning (MRP).Both MRP and MRP II are seen as predecessors to Enterprise resource planning (ERP).



MRP II is an extension of the original materials requirements planning (MRP I) system. Materials requirements planning (MRP) is one of the first software-based integrated information systems designed to improve productivity for businesses.



A materials requirements planning information system is a sales forecast-based system used to schedule raw material deliveries and quantities, given assumptions of machine and labor units required to fulfill a sales forecast.



By the 1980s, manufacturers realized they needed software that could also tie into their accounting systems and forecast inventory requirements. MRP II was provided as a solution, which included this functionality in addition to all the capabilities offered by MRP I.


  Real-World Examples of MRP II Software  

The following are a small sampling of some popular MRP II software providers, as of early 2020:



IQMSFishbowlFactoryEdgeProdsmartabasOracle Netsuite Manufacturing EditionEpicorS2K Enterprise


  MRP I vs. MRP II  

For all intents and purposes, MRP II has effectively replaced MRP I software. Most MRP II systems deliver all of the functionality of an MRP system. But in addition to offering master production scheduling, bill of materials (BOM), and inventory tracking, MRP II provides functionality within logistics, marketing, and general finance.



For example, MRP II is able to account for variables that MRP is not—including machine and personnel capacity—providing a more realistic and holistic representation of a company’s operating capabilities. Many MRP II solutions also offer simulation features that allow operators to enter variables and see the downstream effect. Because of its ability to provide feedback on a given operation, MRP II is sometimes referred to as a closed-loop system.



MRP I included the following three major functionalities:



master production schedulingbill of materialsinventory tracking



MRP II includes those three, plus the following:



machine capacity schedulingdemand forecastingquality assurancegeneral accounting



MRP II systems are still in wide use by manufacturing companies today and can either be found as stand-alone solutions or as part of an enterprise resource planning (ERP) system. Enterprise Resources Planning (ERP) software systems are regarded as the successors of MRP II software.



ERP suites include applications well outside the scope of manufacturing. These can include everything from human resources and customer relationship management to enterprise asset management.
What Is a Maquiladora?  

The term maquiladora refers to a factory or manufacturing plant in Mexico. These corporations are approved for operation by the country's Secretariat of Commerce and Industrial Development under a decree established in 1989 and are owned by foreign entities.



Maquiladoras were first developed in the 1960s as a way to encourage foreign investment and address unemployment. As such, they usually operate near the U.S.-Mexico border. Companies that operate under the maquiladora model are able to take advantage of numerous benefits. The products manufactured by these factories are normally exported beyond the Mexican border.





Key Takeaways

A maquiladora is a low-cost factory in Mexico that is owned by a foreign corporation.Facilities are usually located near the U.S.-Mexico border.These plants assemble products and export them back to the United States and other countries.Companies can capitalize on a cheaper labor force in Mexico and certain tax advantages under the North American Free Trade Agreement, the USMCA, and the IMMEX Program.Despite the benefits, maquiladoras have come under fire because of the way they exploit their labor force.


   Understanding a Maquiladora  

As noted above, a maquiladora is a factory located in Mexico but owned and run by a foreign entity. The first plants of this kind were established in 1961 to help stimulate the domestic market and attract foreign investment. Many of these companies are located along the United States-Mexico border. The structure of a maquiladora system is set up so that the parent company is located in the United States while the manufacturing operation or factory is located in Mexico.



The Mexican Secretary of the Economy determines whether a plant is officially considered a maquiladora. This official designation is important because it qualifies the plant for unlimited foreign capital investment and duty-free imports. Duty-free imports apply to the raw and semi-finished materials shipped after manufacture or assembly, as well as to the machinery used in the manufacturing process.



The factories that participate in the maquila program, which are also known as twin plants, manufacture a variety of goods. In fact, there are thousands of maquiladoras that produce everything from clothing and consumer electronics to cars, drones, medical devices, and aircraft components. Export may be direct or indirect, whether that's through the sale of products or shipping through another factory or export company.



These factories have certain tax advantages that make them attractive to businesses. Companies can capitalize on a cheaper labor force in Mexico and also receive the benefits of doing business in the U.S. The presence of maquiladoras contributed significantly to the industrialization of the Mexican-American border.






Although maquilas can open anywhere in Mexico, they are not permitted to operate in highly congested parts of the country, including Guadalajara, Mexico City, and the Monterrey urban areas.


   Benefits of a Maquiladora  

As noted above, there are a number of benefits that come with establishing a maquiladora. We've listed some of the most common ones below.


  Economic Benefits  

The first and obvious advantage is the economic benefit that comes with establishing maquiladoras for Mexico as well as border cities and states where they may be located. Once these factories are set up, they provide a source of labor for local residents and can help boost the local economy. Maquilas effectively help industrialize border cities in Mexico that may otherwise be characterized by high unemployment.



The economies of border cities and states also benefit because of the administrative centers that are set up on the U.S. side, as well as the transport and customs services that result from import-export operations.


  Costs and Incentives  

Companies can take advantage of lower costs and tax benefits by setting up maquilas. Labor costs are fairly low in Mexico, which makes production cheaper. That's because there's a larger labor pool that may be looking for work.



Maquilas also help companies cut down the costs associated with tariffs and duties. For instance, companies are exempt from the 16% value-added tax (VAT) on raw materials used for production. They are also exempt from paying duties when they export goods marked "Made in Mexico" to Canada and the U.S. This is because of the trade relationship that exists between the U.S. and Mexico under the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA).


  Access to Labor  

Border towns are commonly known for high unemployment rates, where people are actively looking for work. Setting up a maquila in a Mexican town gives companies access to a greater and cheaper labor pool. Although many of the people available for work may be unskilled, it gives workers a chance to transition to the skilled category.


  Location  

Aside from a few exceptions, maquilas can be set up anywhere in Mexico. But from a logistical standpoint, it makes more sense to establish a presence along the border of Mexico and the United States. Many maquiladoras are also strategically located close to airports, roads, railroads, and shipping ports.



Proximity helps lower costs, including transport expenses, and improves supply chain management. For instance, a company may decide to locate the parent company in San Diego and the plant in Tijuana rather than setting up a shop in Detroit and Matamoros.


   Maquiladoras and Labor Exploitation  

Although they may provide numerous economic benefits, maquilas have come under fire for the way they may exploit the labor force. Although they provide competitive wages for those who work in these facilities, the pay is still relatively low. In fact, the pay can be at or below the poverty line. Wages are normally based on daily rather than hourly rates and workers are often contracted for 48-hour shifts each week.



This is compounded by American border and migrant policies, as well as an increased military presence at the border. Migrants who want to enter the United States from Central America often seek work in these facilities. This demand for employment from non-Mexicans allows corporate management to take advantage of these workers by paying them drastically lower wages.



The conditions of employment may also be a big issue for plant workers. For instance, workers may experience health risks and unsafe working conditions. Housing conditions may be unsound or inadequate, especially for migrant workers.



There is often a lack of representation for workers. Labor unions may exist on paper, giving workers false hope that their needs and demands are met. And employment contracts are often written in favor of plant owners rather than workers, giving virtually no protection to workers' rights.


   History of Maquiladoras  

The creation of the maquiladora system was spurred by the end of the Bracero program in 1964. The Bracero program allowed Mexican agricultural workers to be employed in the U.S. seasonally. In order to address the high rates of unemployment that the ending of the Bracero program created, the Mexican government created the maquiladora program. This provided U.S. corporations with a vast supply of cheap labor.



The ratification of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) in 1994 ended tariffs that impacted the maquiladoras system. Mexican import duties were waived and these factories were able to take advantage of preferential duty rates for certain products. This led to an explosion in the number of maquiladoras—the second half of the 1990s saw the number of maquiladoras nearly doubled each year—not to mention a boost in economic growth to the tune of $345 billion in 2014.



Improvements were made to the maquiladora program through the IMMEX program, which was formerly known as the Maquiladora Program. This new program increased the benefits, leading to a further reduction in costs, increased operational efficiencies, and the modernization of the establishment process. Under the program, companies can register as one of the following entities:



Holding Company
Industrial
Outsourcing
Services
Shelter



The IMMEX Program has led to significant growth in the industry. Reports indicate that export increased between 2005 and 2017 from $210 billion to $419 billion.


   Maquiladoras FAQs  
  How Have Maquiladoras Impacted the Mexican Economy?  

Maquiladoras have a significant impact on Mexico's economy. They employ millions of workers each year, many of whom are unskilled. By giving them access to employment, these plants help the individuals make the leap from unskilled to skilled workers. These facilities also make up a good portion of the goods exported to the United States.


  Are Maquiladoras Similar to Sweatshops?  

While there may be cases of unsafe working conditions or unscrupulous maquila owners who take advantage of their employees by paying them low wages, they don't have the same reputation as sweatshops. Sweatshops don't provide their workers with a living wage and the overall conditions are unsafe to the point where they may even be dangerous. Many of these establishments employ children and women, don't provide any job security or guarantee of wages.


  Where Are Maquiladoras Generally Located?  

Although there's no limitation to where maquiladoras can be located, they are generally found along the border of the United States and Mexico.


  Who Benefits the Most from Maquiladoras?  

Border cities and states tend to benefit the most from maquiladoras. Those in Mexico benefit from the creation of plants and facilities and a boost in labor and employment. American companies can benefit from cheaper labor costs, a reduction in production costs, import-export tariffs, and duties.
What Is Margin?  

In finance, the margin is the collateral that an investor has to deposit with their broker or exchange to cover the credit risk the holder poses for the broker or the exchange. An investor can create credit risk if they borrow cash from the broker to buy financial instruments, borrow financial instruments to sell them short, or enter into a derivative contract.



Buying on margin occurs when an investor buys an asset by borrowing the balance from a broker. Buying on margin refers to the initial payment made to the broker for the asset; the investor uses the marginable securities in their brokerage account as collateral. 



In a general business context, the margin is the difference between a product or service's selling price and the cost of production, or the ratio of profit to revenue. Margin can also refer to the portion of the interest rate on an adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM) added to the adjustment-index rate.





Key Takeaways

Margin is the money borrowed from a broker to purchase an investment and is the difference between the total value of an investment and the loan amount.Margin trading refers to the practice of using borrowed funds from a broker to trade a financial asset, which forms the collateral for the loan from the broker.A margin account is a standard brokerage account in which an investor is allowed to use the current cash or securities in their account as collateral for a loan.Leverage conferred by margin will tend to amplify both gains and losses. In the event of a loss, a margin call may require your broker to liquidate securities without prior consent.

   Understanding Margin and Marging Trading  

Margin refers to the amount of equity an investor has in their brokerage account. "To buy on margin" means to use the money borrowed from a broker to purchase securities. You must have a margin account to do so, rather than a standard brokerage account. A margin account is a brokerage account in which the broker lends the investor money to buy more securities than what they could otherwise buy with the balance in their account.



Using margin to purchase securities is effectively like using the current cash or securities already in your account as collateral for a loan. The collateralized loan comes with a periodic interest rate that must be paid. The investor is using borrowed money, and therefore both the losses and gains will be magnified as a result. Margin investing can be advantageous in cases where the investor anticipates earning a higher rate of return on the investment than what they are paying in interest on the loan.



For example, if you have an initial margin requirement of 60% for your margin account, and you want to purchase $10,000 worth of securities, then your margin would be $6,000, and you could borrow the rest from the broker.






The Securities and Exchange Commission has stated that margin accounts "can be very risky and they are not appropriate for everyone".


   How the Process Works  

Buying on margin is borrowing money from a broker in order to purchase stock. You can think of it as a loan from your brokerage. Margin trading allows you to buy more stock than you'd be able to normally.



To trade on margin, you need a margin account. This is different from a regular cash account, in which you trade using the money in the account. With a margin account, you deposit cash, which serves as the collateral for a loan to purchase securities. You can use this to borrow up to 50% of the purchase price of an investment. So if you deposit $5,000, you could buy up to $10,000 in securities.



Your broker will charge interest on this loan you're using, which you'll need to repay. If you sell your securities, the proceeds will pay off your loan first, and you can keep what's left.



The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regulate margin trading, with strict rules as to how much you must deposit, how much you can borrow, and how much you must keep in your account.


   Components of Margin Trading  
  Minimum Margin  

By law, your broker is required to obtain your consent to open a margin account. The margin account may be part of your standard account opening agreement or may be a completely separate agreement. An initial investment of at least $2,000 is required for a margin account, though some brokerages require more. This deposit is known as the minimum margin.


  Initial Margin  

Once the account is opened and operational, you can borrow up to 50% of the purchase price of a stock. This portion of the purchase price that you deposit is known as the initial margin. It's essential to know that you don't have to margin all the way up to 50%. You can borrow less, say 10% or 25%. Be aware that some brokerages require you to deposit more than 50% of the purchase price.



You can keep your loan as long as you want, provided you fulfill your obligations such as paying interest on time on the borrowed funds. When you sell the stock in a margin account, the proceeds go to your broker against the repayment of the loan until it is fully paid.


  Maintenance Margin and Margin Call  

There is also a restriction called the maintenance margin, which is the minimum account balance you must maintain before your broker will force you to deposit more funds or sell stock to pay down your loan. When this happens, it's known as a margin call. A margin call is effectively a demand from your brokerage for you to add money to your account or close out positions to bring your account back to the required level. If you do not meet the margin call, your brokerage firm can close out any open positions in order to bring the account back up to the minimum value. Your brokerage firm can do this without your approval and can choose which position(s) to liquidate.



In addition, your brokerage firm can charge you a commission for the transaction(s). You are responsible for any losses sustained during this process, and your brokerage firm may liquidate enough shares or contracts to exceed the initial margin requirement.


   Special Considerations  

Because using margin is a form of borrowing money it comes with costs, and marginable securities in the account are collateral. The primary cost is the interest you have to pay on your loan. The interest charges are applied to your account unless you decide to make payments. Over time, your debt level increases as interest charges accrue against you. As debt increases, the interest charges increase, and so on. Therefore, buying on margin is mainly used for short-term investments. The longer you hold an investment, the greater the return that is needed to break even. If you hold an investment on margin for a long period of time, the odds that you will make a profit are stacked against you.



Not all stocks qualify to be bought on margin. The Federal Reserve Board regulates which stocks are marginable. As a rule of thumb, brokers will not allow customers to purchase penny stocks or initial public offerings (IPOs) on margin because of the day-to-day risks involved with these types of stocks. Individual brokerages can also decide not to margin certain stocks, so check with them to see what restrictions exist on your margin account.






Significant margin calls may have a domino effect on other investors. Should a single major investor face a significant margin call, their forced liquidation may decrease the value of the securities held as collateral by other margin traders, putting these investors at risk of a margin call of their own.


   Advantages and Disadvantages of Margin Trading  



Advantages

May result in greater gains due to leverage
Increases purchasing power
Often has more flexibility than other types of loans
May be self-fulfilling opportunity cycle where increases in collateral value further increase leverage opportunities



Disadvantages

May result in greater losses due to leverage
Incurs account fees and interest charges
May result in margin calls which require additional equity investments
May result in forced liquidations which result in the sale of securities (often at a loss)





  Advantages  

The primary reason investors margin trade is to capitalize on leverage. Margin trading centers increasing purchasing power by increasing the capital available to purchase securities. Instead of buying securities with money you own, investors can buy more securities using their capital as collateral for loans greater than their capital on hand.



For this reason, margin trading can amplify profits. Again, with more securities in hand, increases in value have greater consequential outcomes because you're more heavily invested using debt. On the same note, if the value of the securities posted as collateral also increase, you may be able to further utilize leverage as your collateral basis has increased.



Margin trading is also usually more flexible than other types of loans. There may not be a fixed repayment schedule, and your broker's maintenance margin requirements may be simple or automated. For most margin accounts, the loan is open until the securities are sold in which final payments are often due to the borrower.


  Disadvantages  

If investors primarily enter into margin trading to amplify gains, they must be aware that margin trading also amplifies losses. Should the value of securities bought on margin rapidly decline in value, an investor may owe not only their initial equity investment but also additional capital to lenders. Margin trading also comes at a cost; brokers often charge interest expense, and these fees are assessed regardless of how well (or poorly) your margin account is performing.



Because there are margin and equity requirements, investors may face a margin call. This is a requirement from the broker to deposit additional funds into their margin account due to the decrease in the equity value of securities being held. Investors must be mindful of needing this additional capital on hand to satisfy the margin call.



Should investors not be able to contribute additional equity or if the value of an account drops so fast it breaches certain margin requirements, a forced liquidation may occur. This forced liquidation will sell the securities purchased on margin and may result in losses to satisfy the broker's requirement.


   Example of Margin  

Let's say that you deposit $10,000 in your margin account. Because you put up 50% of the purchase price, this means you have $20,000 worth of buying power. Then, if you buy $5,000 worth of stock, you still have $15,000 in buying power remaining. You have enough cash to cover this transaction and haven't tapped into your margin. You start borrowing the money only when you buy securities worth more than $10,000. 



Note that the buying power of a margin account changes daily depending on the price movement of the marginable securities in the account.


   Other Uses of Margin  
  Accounting Margin  

In business accounting, margin refers to the difference between revenue and expenses, where businesses typically track their gross profit margins, operating margins, and net profit margins. The gross profit margin measures the relationship between a company's revenues and the cost of goods sold (COGS). Operating profit margin takes into account COGS and operating expenses and compares them with revenue, and net profit margin takes all these expenses, taxes, and interest into account.


  Margin in Mortgage Lending  

Adjustable-rate mortgages (ARM) offer a fixed interest rate for an introductory period of time, and then the rate adjusts. To determine the new rate, the bank adds a margin to an established index. In most cases, the margin stays the same throughout the life of the loan, but the index rate changes. To understand this more clearly, imagine a mortgage with an adjustable rate that has a margin of 4% and is indexed to the Treasury Index. If the Treasury Index is 6%, the interest rate on the mortgage is the 6% index rate plus the 4% margin, or 10%.




What Does It Mean to Trade on Margin?
Trading on margin means borrowing money from a brokerage firm in order to carry out trades. When trading on margin, investors first deposit cash that serves as collateral for the loan and then pay ongoing interest payments on the money they borrow. This loan increases the buying power of investors, allowing them to buy a larger quantity of securities. The securities purchased automatically serve as collateral for the margin loan.




What Is a Margin Call?
A margin call is a scenario in which a broker who had previously extended a margin loan to an investor sends a notice to that investor asking them to increase the amount of collateral in their margin account. When faced with a margin call, investors often need to deposit additional cash into their account, sometimes by selling other securities. If the investor refuses to do so, the broker has the right to forcefully sell the investor’s positions in order to raise the necessary funds. Many investors fear margin calls because they can force investors to sell positions at unfavorable prices.




What Are Some Other Meanings of the Term Margin?
Outside of margin lending, the term margin also has other uses in finance. For example, it is used as a catch-all term to refer to various profit margins, such as the gross profit margin, pre-tax profit margin, and net profit margin. The term is also sometimes used to refer to interest rates or risk premiums.




What Are the Risks of Trading on Margin?
When investing on margin, the investor is at risk of losing more money than what they deposited into the margin account. This may occur when the value of the securities held declines, requiring the investor to either provide additional funds or incur a forced sale of the securities.


   The Bottom Line  

Investors looking to amplify gain and loss potential on trades may consider trading on margin. Margin trading is the practice of borrowing money, depositing cash to serve as collateral, and entering into trades using borrowed funds. Through the use of debt and leverage, margin may result in higher profits than what could have been invested should the investor have only used their personal money. On the other hand, should security values decline, an investor may be faced owing more money than what they offered as collateral.
What Is a Margin Account?  

The term margin account refers to a brokerage account in which a trader's broker-dealer lends them cash to purchase stocks or other financial products. The margin account and the securities held within it are used as collateral for the loan. It comes with a periodic interest rate that the investor must pay to keep it active. Borrowing money from a broker-dealer through a margin account allows investors to increase their purchasing and trading power. Investing with margin accounts means using leverage, which increases the chance of magnifying an investor's profits and losses.





Key Takeaways

A margin account allows a trader to borrow funds from a broker, and not need to put up the entire value of a trade.A margin account typically allows a trader to trade other financial products, such as futures and options (if approved and available with that broker), as well as stocks. Margin increases the profit and loss potential of the trader's capital.When trading stocks, a margin fee or interest is charged on borrowed funds.


   How a Margin Account Works  

If an investor purchases securities with margin funds and those securities appreciate in value beyond the interest rate charged on the funds, the investor will earn a better total return than if they had only purchased securities with their own cash. This is the advantage of using margin funds.



On the downside, the brokerage firm charges interest on the margin funds for as long as the loan is outstanding, increasing the investor’s cost of buying the securities. If the securities decline in value, the investor will be underwater and will have to pay interest to the broker on top of that.



If a margin account’s equity drops below the maintenance margin level, the brokerage firm will make a margin call to the investor. Within a specified number of days—typically within three days, although in some situations it may be less—the investor must deposit more cash or sell some stock to offset all or a portion of the difference between the security’s price and the maintenance margin.



A brokerage firm has the right to ask a customer to increase the amount of capital they have in a margin account, sell the investor’s securities if the broker feels their own funds are at risk or sue the investor if they do not fulfill a margin call or if they are carrying a negative balance in their account.



The investor has the potential to lose more money than the funds deposited in the account. For these reasons, a margin account is only suitable for a sophisticated investor with a thorough understanding of the additional investment risks and requirements of trading with a margin.



A margin account may not be used for buying stocks on margin in an individual retirement account, a trust, or other fiduciary accounts. In addition, a margin account cannot be used with stock trading accounts of less than $2,000.






   Margin on Other Financial Products  

Financial products, other than stocks, can be purchased on margin. Futures traders also frequently use margin, for example.



With other financial products, the initial margin and maintenance margin will vary. Exchanges or other regulatory bodies set the minimum margin requirements, although certain brokers may increase these margin requirements. That means the margin may vary by broker. The initial margin required on futures is typically much lower than for stocks. While stock investors must put up 50% of the value of a trade, futures traders may only be required to put up 10% or less.



Margin accounts are required for most options trading strategies as well.


   Example of a Margin Account  

Assume an investor with $2,500 in a margin account wants to buy Nokia's stock for $5 per share. The customer could use additional margin funds of up to $2,500 supplied by the broker to purchase $5,000 worth of Nokia stock, or 1,000 shares. If the stock appreciates to $10 per share, the investor can sell the shares for $10,000. If they do so, after repaying the broker's $2,500, and not counting the original $2,500 invested, the trader profits $5,000.



Had they not borrowed funds, they would have only made $2,500 when their stock doubled. By taking double the position the potential profit was doubled.



Had the stock dropped to $2.50, though, all the customer's money would be gone. Since 1,000 shares * $2.50 is $2,500, the broker would notify the client that the position is being closed unless the customer puts more capital in the account. The customer has lost their funds and can no longer maintain the position. This is a margin call.



The above scenarios assume there are no fees, however, interest is paid on the borrowed funds. If the trade took one year, and the interest rate is 10%, the client would have paid 10% * $2,500, or $250 in interest. Their actual profit is $5,000, less $250 and commissions. Even if the client lost money on the trade, their loss is increased by the $250 plus commissions.
What Is a Margin Call?  

A margin call occurs when the percentage of an investor’s equity in a margin account falls below the broker’s required amount. An investor’s margin account contains securities bought with a combination of the investor’s own money and money borrowed from the investor’s broker.



A margin call refers specifically to a broker’s demand that an investor deposit additional money or securities into the account so that the value of the investor's equity (and the account value) rises to a minimum value indicated by the maintenance requirement.



A margin call is usually an indicator that securities held in the margin account have decreased in value. When a margin call occurs, the investor must choose to either deposit additional funds or marginable securities in the account or sell some of the assets held in their account.





Key Takeaways

A margin call occurs when a margin account runs low on funds, usually because of a losing trade.Margin calls are demands for additional capital or securities to bring a margin account up to the maintenance requirement.Brokers may force a trader to sell assets, regardless of the market price, to meet the margin call if the trader doesn’t deposit funds.Margin calls can also occur when a stock goes up in price and losses start mounting in accounts that have sold the stock short.Investors can avoid margin calls by monitoring their equity and keeping enough funds in their account to maintain the value above the required maintenance level.

   What Triggers a Margin Call?  

When an investor pays to buy and sell securities using a combination of their own funds and money borrowed from a broker, the investor is buying on margin. An investor’s equity in the investment is equal to the market value of the securities minus the borrowed amount.



A margin call is triggered when the investor’s equity, as a percentage of the total market value of securities, falls below a certain required level (called the maintenance margin).



The New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA)—the regulatory body for the majority of securities firms operating in the United States—each requires that investors maintain an equity level of 25% of the total value of their securities when buying on margin. Some brokerage firms require a higher maintenance requirement, sometimes as much as 30% to 40%.



Margin calls can occur at any time due to a drop in account value. However, they are more likely to happen during periods of market volatility.


   Example of a Margin Call  

Here's an example of how a change in the value of a margin account decreases an investor's equity to a level where a broker must issue a margin call.

   How to Cover a Margin Call  

If an investor's account value drops to a level where a margin call is issued by their broker, the investor typically has two to five days to meet it. Using the margin call example above, here are the options for doing so:



Deposit $200 in cash into the account.Deposit $285 of marginable securities (fully paid for) into your account. This amount is derived by dividing the required funds of $200 by (1 less the 30% equity requirement): 200/(1-.30) = $285.Use a combination of the above two options.Sell other securities to obtain the needed cash.



If an investor isn't able to meet the margin call, a broker may close out any open positions to replenish the account to the minimum required value. They may be able to do this without the investor’s approval. Furthermore, the broker may also charge an investor a commission on these transaction(s). This investor is held responsible for any losses sustained during this process.






The amount of a margin loan depends on a security's purchase price, and therefore is a fixed amount. However, the dollar amount determined by the maintenance margin requirement is based on the current account value, not on the initial purchase price. That's why it fluctuates.


   How to Avoid a Margin Call  

Before opening a margin account, investors should carefully consider whether they really need one. Most long-term investors don't need to buy on margin to earn solid returns. Plus, the loans aren't free. Brokerages charge interest on them.



However, if you wish to invest with margin, here are a few things you can do to manage your account, avoid a margin call, or be ready for it if it comes.



Make sure cash is available to place in your account immediately. Consider keeping it in an interest-earning account at the same brokerage.
Build a well-diversified portfolio. It may help limit margin calls since a single position is less likely to decrease the account value.
Monitor your open positions, equity, and margin loan regularly (even daily).
Create a custom-made alert at some comfortable level above the margin maintenance requirement. If your account falls to it, deposit funds or securities to increase your equity. 
If you receive a margin call, take care of it immediately.






In addition to keeping adequate cash and securities in their account, a good way for an investor to avoid margin calls is to use protective stop orders to limit losses in any equity positions.




Is It Risky to Trade Stocks on Margin?
It is certainly riskier to trade stocks with margin than without it. This is because trading stocks on margin is trading with borrowed money. Leveraged trades are riskier than unleveraged ones. The biggest risk with margin trading is that investors can lose more than they have invested.




How Can a Margin Call Be Met?
A margin call is issued by the broker when there is a margin deficiency in the trader’s margin account. To rectify a margin deficiency, the trader has to either deposit cash or marginable securities in the margin account or liquidate some securities in the margin account.




Can a Trader Delay Meeting a Margin Call?
A margin call must be satisfied immediately and without any delay. Although some brokers may give you two to five days to meet the margin call, the fine print of a standard margin account agreement will generally state that to satisfy an outstanding margin call, the broker has the right to liquidate any or all securities or other assets held in the margin account at its discretion and without prior notice to the trader. To prevent such forced liquidation, it is best to meet a margin call and rectify the margin deficiency promptly.




How Can I Manage the Risks Associated with Trading on Margin?
Measures to manage the risks associated with trading on margin include: using stop loss orders to limit losses; keeping the amount of leverage to manageable levels; and borrowing against a diversified portfolio to reduce the probability of a margin call, which is significantly more likely with a single stock.




Does the Total Level of Margin Debt Have an Impact on Market Volatility?
A high level of margin debt may exacerbate market volatility. During steep market declines, clients are forced to sell stocks to meet margin calls. This can lead to a vicious circle, where intense selling pressure drives stock prices lower, triggering more margin calls and more selling.


   The Bottom Line  

Buying on margin isn't for everyone. While it can give investors more bang for their buck, there are downsides. For one, it's only an advantage if your securities increase enough to repay the margin loan (and the interest on it). Another headache can be the margin calls for funds that investors must meet.



A margin call may require you to deposit additional cash and securities. You may even have to sell existing holdings. Or you may have to close out the margined position at a loss. Since margin calls can occur when markets are volatile, you may have to sell securities to meet the call at lower than expected prices.
What Is Margin Debt?  

Margin debt is the debt a brokerage customer takes on by trading on margin. When purchasing securities through a broker, investors have the option of using a cash account and covering the entire cost of the investment themselves, or using a margin account—meaning they borrow part of the initial capital from their broker. The portion that investors borrow is known as margin debt, while the portion they fund themselves is the margin, or equity. Using margin debt has both risks and potential benefits.





Key Takeaways

Margin debt is the amount of money an investor borrows from their broker via a margin account.Margin debt can be used to buy securities. Regulation T sets the initial margin at a minimum of 50%, which means an investor can only take on margin debt of 50% of the account balance. Meanwhile, the typical margin requirement at brokerages is 25%, meaning that customers' equity must stay above that ratio to prevent a margin call. Using margin debt as a form of leverage can magnify gains but also exacerbate losses. 


   How Margin Debt Works  

As an example of using margin debt to buy securities, suppose an investor we'll call Sheila wants to buy 1,000 shares of Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) for $100 per share. She doesn't want to put down the entire $100,000 at this time, but the Federal Reserve Board's Regulation T limits her broker to lending her 50% of the initial investment—also called the initial margin. 



She deposits $50,000 in initial margin, while taking on $50,000 in margin debt. The 1,000 shares of Johnson & Johnson she then purchases act as collateral for this loan.



(Not all brokers would allow Sheila to borrow that much. Brokerages often have their own rules for buying on margin, which can be stricter than those imposed by regulators.)





Note

Excessive buying on margin is considered one of the causes of the famous U.S. stock market crash in 1929. At that time, margin rules were much looser, often allowing investors to borrow 90% of the money to buy stocks and putting down only 10% in cash. We know today how that turned out.


   Advantages and Disadvantages of Margin Debt  

Buying on margin has both risks and potential benefits for investors. Generally speaking it isn't for beginners or for those who can't afford to lose money.


  Disadvantages  

Two scenarios illustrate the potential risks and rewards of taking on margin debt. In the first, Johnson & Johnson's price drops to $60. Sheila's margin debt remains at $50,000, but her equity has fallen to $10,000, which is the value of the stock (1,000 × $60 = $60,000) minus her margin debt of $50,000. The Financial Industry Regulation Authority (FINRA) and the exchanges have a maintenance margin requirement of 25%, meaning that customers' equity must remain above that ratio in margin accounts.



Falling below the maintenance margin requirement triggers a margin call. Unless Sheila deposits another $5,000 in cash to bring her margin up to 25% of the securities' $60,000 value, or $15,000, the broker is entitled to sell her stock (without notifying her) until her account complies with the rules. This is known as a margin call.



Here again, brokerages may have stricter rules than the law requires, such as setting their maintenance margin requirement at 30% or 40%, for example.





Pros

Allows investor to buy stock with borrowed money
Investing on margin can magnify any gains because of leverage, resulting in greater profit



Cons

Buying on margin means taking on debt that must be repaid
If stock loses value, investor may face a margin call and have to come up with cash quickly





  Advantages   

A second scenario demonstrates the potential rewards of trading on margin. Say that in the example above, Johnson & Johnson's share price rises to $150. Sheila's 1,000 shares are now worth $150,000, with $50,000 of that being margin debt and $100,000 equity. If Sheila sells commission- and fee-free, she receives $100,000 after repaying her broker. Her return on investment (ROI) is equal to 100%—a $50,000 return on her $50,000 cash investment.



Now let's assume that Sheila had purchased the stock simply using a cash account, meaning that she funded the entire initial investment of $100,000, so she does not need to repay her broker after selling. Her ROI in this scenario is equal to 50%—a $50,000 profit on her cash investment of $100,000.



In both cases, her profit was $50,000, but in the margin account scenario, she made that money using half as much of her own capital as in the cash account scenario. The capital she has freed up by trading on margin can now go toward other investments if she wishes. These scenarios illustrate the basic trade-off involved in taking on leverage: the potential gains are greater, as are the risks. 




How Long Do You Have to Answer a Margin Call?
Brokerage firms typically give customers two to five days to come up with the cash after a margin call, according to FINRA.




How Much Money Do You Need to Trade on Margin
FINRA rules require that investors "deposit with your brokerage firm a minimum of $2,000 or 100% of the purchase price of the margin securities, whichever is less," according to the Securities and Exchange Commission. However, if the brokerage designates you as a pattern day trader, the cash requirement rises to a minimum of $25,000.




What Is a Pattern Day Trader?
According to FINRA rules, a pattern day trader is "any customer who executes four or more 'day trades' within five business days, provided that the number of day trades represents more than 6% of the customer's total trades in the margin account for that same five business day period." Brokerage firms can also use a broader definition, classifying more customers as pattern day traders.


   The Bottom Line  

Buying on margin can allow investors to reap greater gains on a percentage basis if the stock they buy goes up in value. If it goes down, however, they may have to scrape up additional cash quickly before the broker sells off their stock. While buying on margin can work for savvy (and lucky) investors, it is risky and shouldn't be entered into by anyone unless they have sufficient cash on hand and can afford to lose it.
What is Margin Loan Availability?  

Margin loan availability describes the amount in a margin account that is currently available for purchasing securities on margin or the amount that is available for withdrawal. A margin account makes loans available to the customer of a brokerage firm using the customer's securities in their account as collateral.


   How Margin Loan Availability Works  

Margin loan availability tells a brokerage customer how much money in their margin account is currently available for purchasing securities on margin and how much is available for withdrawal. As the value of the securities in the account rises and falls, the amount of money that becomes available for loan also changes, since the securities have to cover the amount made available for the loan. If the customer's securities drop in value, so does the margin loan availability.



Margin loan availability can be used in a couple of specific contexts:



To show the dollar amount in an existing margin account that is currently available for purchasing securities. For new accounts, this represents the percentage value of the current balance that is available for future margin purchases.
To show the dollar amount available for withdrawal from an account with existing marginable positions being used as collateral.



Margin loan availability will change daily as the value of margin debt (which includes purchased securities) changes. But it may not reflect pending trades that fall in between the trade date and the settlement date.



Brokerage firms are required to impose a maintenance requirement on margin accounts, which is a percentage of the total market value of the securities purchased on margin. If the margin loan availability amount—essentially, the equity in an investor's account— falls below the maintenance margin, the investor may be due for a margin call, which is a formal request to sell some of the marginable securities or deposit additional cash into the account, typically within three days. The Federal Reserve Board, self-regulatory organizations (SROs) such as the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), and the securities exchanges have rules governing margin trading, but brokerage firms can also set more restrictive requirements on their own.






Margin loan availability rises and falls with the value of the securities in an investor's margin account. If the account's equity drops too low, the investor may face a margin call and have to sell securities to cover the shortfall.


   Example of Margin Loan Availability  

Let's say that Bert M. is a client at Ernie's Brokerage Firm. Bert has a margin account with some securities in it. These securities are held as collateral by Ernie's Brokerage Firm for any money Bert borrows to buy securities or withdraw from the account.



The money borrowed from Ernie's firm to buy these additional securities or for a withdrawal is called a margin loan. The available amount that Bert can take at any given time is called the margin loan availability and is based on the current value of his pledged securities.
What Is Margin of Safety?  

Margin of safety is a principle of investing in which an investor only purchases securities when their market price is significantly below their intrinsic value. In other words, when the market price of a security is significantly below your estimation of its intrinsic value, the difference is the margin of safety. Because investors may set a margin of safety in accordance with their own risk preferences, buying securities when this difference is present allows an investment to be made with minimal downside risk.



Alternatively, in accounting, the margin of safety, or safety margin, refers to the difference between actual sales and break-even sales. Managers can utilize the margin of safety to know how much sales can decrease before the company or a project becomes unprofitable. 





Key Takeaways

A margin of safety is a built-in cushion allowing for some losses to be incurred without major negative effect.In investing, the margin of safety incorporates quantitative and qualitative considerations to determine a price target and a safety margin that discounts that target.By purchasing stocks at prices well below their target, this discounted price builds in a margin of safety in case estimates were incorrect or biased.In accounting the safety margin is built into break-even forecasts to allow for some leeway in those estimates.

   Understanding Margin of Safety  

The margin of safety principle was popularized by famed British-born American investor Benjamin Graham (known as the father of value investing) and his followers, most notably Warren Buffett. Investors utilize both qualitative and quantitative factors, including firm management, governance, industry performance, assets and earnings, to determine a security's intrinsic value. The market price is then used as the point of comparison to calculate the margin of safety. Buffett, who is a staunch believer in the margin of safety and has declared it one of his "cornerstones of investing," has been known to apply as much as a 50% discount to the intrinsic value of a stock as his price target.



Taking into account a margin of safety when investing provides a cushion against errors in analyst judgment or calculation. It does not, however, guarantee a successful investment, largely because determining a company's "true" worth, or intrinsic value, is highly subjective. Investors and analysts may have a different method for calculating intrinsic value, and rarely are they exactly accurate and precise. In addition, it's notoriously difficult to predict a company's earnings or revenue.


   Example of Investing and Margin of Safety  

As scholarly as Graham was, his principle was based on simple truths. He knew that a stock priced at $1 today could just as likely be valued at 50 cents or $1.50 in the future. He also recognized that the current valuation of $1 could be off, which means he would be subjecting himself to unnecessary risk. He concluded that if he could buy a stock at a discount to its intrinsic value, he would limit his losses substantially. Although there was no guarantee that the stock’s price would increase, the discount provided the margin of safety he needed to ensure that his losses would be minimal.



For example, if he were to determine that the intrinsic value of XYZ’s stock is $162, which is well below its share price of $192, he might apply a discount of 20% for a target purchase price of $130. In this example, he may feel XYZ has a fair value at $192 but he would not consider buying it above its intrinsic value of $162. In order to absolutely limit his downside risk, he sets his purchase price at $130. Using this model, he might not be able to purchase XYZ stock anytime in the foreseeable future. However, if the stock price does decline to $130 for reasons other than a collapse of XYZ’s earnings outlook, he could buy it with confidence.


   Margin of Safety in Accounting  

As a financial metric, the margin of safety is equal to the difference between current or forecasted sales and sales at the break-even point. The margin of safety is sometimes reported as a ratio, in which the aforementioned formula is divided by current or forecasted sales to yield a percentage value. The figure is used in both break-even analysis and forecasting to inform a firm's management of the existing cushion in actual sales or budgeted sales before the firm would incur a loss.




How Do You Calculate the Margin of Safety in Accounting?
To calculate the margin of safety, determine the break-even point and the budgeted sales. Subtract the break-even point from the actual or budgeted sales and then divide by the sales. The number that results is expressed as a percentage.




What Is the Margin of Safety in Dollars?
The margin of safety in dollars is calculated as current sales minus breakeven sales. 




Is the Margin of Safety the Same as the Degree of Operating Leverage?
The margin of safety is the difference between actual sales and break-even sales, while the degree of operating leverage (DOL) shows how a company's operating income changes after a percentage change in its sales.
What Is Marginal Analysis?  

Marginal analysis is an examination of the additional benefits of an activity compared to the additional costs incurred by that same activity. Companies use marginal analysis as a decision-making tool to help them maximize their potential profits. Marginal refers to the focus on the cost or benefit of the next unit or individual, for example, the cost to produce one more widget or the profit earned by adding one more worker.

Marginal refers to the focus on the cost or benefit of the next unit or individual, for example, the cost to produce one more widget or the profit earned by adding one more worker.Companies use marginal analysis as a decision-making tool to help them maximize their potential profits.When a manufacturer wishes to expand its operations, either by adding new product lines or increasing the volume of goods produced from the current product line, a marginal analysis of the costs and benefits is necessary.The primary takeaway of marginal analysis is to operate until marginal benefit equals marginal cost; this is often the most efficient use of resources.


   Understanding Marginal Analysis  

Marginal analysis is also widely used in microeconomics when analyzing how a complex system is affected by marginal manipulation of its comprising variables. In this sense, marginal analysis focuses on examining the results of small changes as the effects cascade across the business as a whole.



Marginal analysis is an examination of the associated costs and potential benefits of specific business activities or financial decisions. The goal is to determine if the costs associated with the change in activity will result in a benefit that is sufficient enough to offset them. Instead of focusing on business output as a whole, the impact on the cost of producing an individual unit is most often observed as a point of comparison.



Marginal analysis can also help in the decision-making process when two potential investments exist, but there are only enough available funds for one. By analyzing the associated costs and estimated benefits, it can be determined if one option will result in higher profits than another.


  Marginal Analysis and Observed Change  

From a microeconomic standpoint, marginal analysis can also relate to observing the effects of small changes within the standard operating procedure or total outputs. For example, a business may attempt to increase output by 1% and analyze the positive and negative effects that occur because of the change, such as changes in overall product quality or how the change impacts the use of resources. If the results of the change are positive, the business may choose to raise production by 1% again, and reexamine the results. These small shifts and the associated changes can help a production facility determine an optimal production rate.


  Marginal Analysis and Opportunity Cost  

Managers should also understand the concept of opportunity cost. Suppose a manager knows that there is room in the budget to hire an additional worker. Marginal analysis tells the manager that an additional factory worker provides net marginal benefit. This does not necessarily make the hire the right decision.



Suppose the manager also knows that hiring an additional salesperson yields an even larger net marginal benefit. In this case, hiring a factory worker is the wrong decision because it is sub-optimal.






Because marginal analysis is only interested in the effect of the very next instance, it pays little attention to fixed start-up costs. Including those costs in a marginal analysis is incorrect and produces the so-called "sunk cost fallacy".


   How to Perform a Marginal Analysis  

Marginal analysis is as simple as taking the margin benefit of an outcome and subtracting the marginal cost. However, this analysis may be difficult to assess as there are many variables and moving parts to consider. To perform a marginal analysis, you should first understand the fixed and variable costs of an activity. Because the fixed costs are not likely to change, your marginal cost will often be equal to your variable expenses.



Next, you can begin marginal analysis by finding the marginal cost and the marginal expense of an activity. Each will simply be the change in cost or benefit for every unit consumed or acquired. Note that while one aspect may remain the same (either the benefit or the cost may be constant), one aspect will often be variable.



Consider the example of consuming pizza at $2/slice. In this example, marginal cost is easy to quantify, as every additional slice of pizza has a marginal cost equivalent to $2. On the other hand, marginal benefit may be more difficult to quantify. If you haven't eaten all day and are hungry, you may state that the first slice of pizza you eat is worth $10 to you. If this is the case, marginal analysis has led you the net benefit equal to the value of $8.



To continue performing marginal analysis, consider how both the benefit and the cost will change with each slice of pizza consumed. If each slice costs $2, your marginal cost will always be $2. However, as you eat more pizza, you'll become full. In fact, there will be a point where you may get sick and begin to have negative marginal benefit for each additional slice eaten.


   Rules of Marginal Analysis  

When performing marginal analysis, there are two profit maximization rules to consider. These two rules dictate the point at which companies should manufacture goods and allocate resources.






Do not confuse the many marginal terms used in economics; be mindful that the best quantity to operate at is when (marginal) revenue equals cost.


  Rule #1: Operate Until Marginal Cost Equals Marginal Revenue  

The overarching rule of marginal analysis is that it is usually in a company's best interest to perform an activity as long as the marginal revenue is greater than the marginal cost. When marginal revenue and marginal cost are equal, there is theoretically no financial incentive for the company to continue the activity, though there may be non-financial factors to consider.



Consider a manufacturing example where it costs $2 to make a good whose marginal revenue is $5. For this unit, the company makes $3. If the next unit costs $4 to make, the company still earns a marginal profit because marginal revenue of $5 is greater than the marginal cost. If the next unit were to cost $6 to make, it would no longer be financially feasible to make and sell the good.



The point at which marginal revenue and marginal cost intersect is often called marginal equilibrium. It is the point at which total company profit is maximized, even if unit profit is not at its highest. In more simple terms using the pizza example above, you should continue to consume pizza as long as you think the marginal benefit you receive of each slice is worth at least the $2 you're paying per piece.


  Rule #2: Equalize Marginal Return Across Products  

Another important rule related to marginal analysis relates to companies that have different products. If a company chooses to only dedicate resources to one product, the potential marginal revenue of the other products is foregone in favor of a product likely with a diminishing marginal profit. To avoid this, every product should have an equal marginal revenue to maximize the amount of benefit obtained, especially if there are resource constraints at play.



Consider the table below outlining the marginal return received from two products. If one unit of Product A is consumed, the consumer receives a marginal benefit of 100. If a third unit of Product B is consumed, the consumer receives a marginal benefit of 30 for that third unit.










Marginal Analysis Example (units unspecified)


Units Consumed 
 Product A
Product B




1
+100 
+50


2 
+25
+40


3 
+10
+25


4 
+5
+15






Based on the table above, this second rule would dictate that the first unit consumed should be one unit of Product A. However, we now know the marginal return of a second unit of Product A only yields a return of 25. This second rule would call for the consumer to consume units of Product B until the marginal revenue of the two products meet. In this example, the highest return would occur after 1 unit of Product A and 3 units of Product B have been consumed.



Let's return once more to our pizza example. Instead of only consuming pizza, imagine the marginal benefit of having a refreshing drink in between bites or slices. The argument here is instead of trying to maximize your benefit received consuming one good, you should try to have the marginal benefit received from the pizza (considering its price) equal to the marginal benefit received from a drink (also considering its price).


   Marginal Cost vs. Marginal Benefit  

A marginal benefit (or marginal product) is an incremental increase in a consumer's benefit in using an additional unit of something. A marginal cost is an incremental increase in the expense a company incurs to produce one additional unit of something.



Marginal benefits normally decline as a consumer decides to consume more and more of a single good. For example, imagine a consumer decides that she needs a new piece of jewelry for her right hand, and she heads to the mall to purchase a ring. She spends $100 for the perfect ring, and then she spots another.



Since she has no need for two rings, she would be unwilling to spend another $100 on a second one. She might, however, be convinced to purchase that second ring at $50. Therefore, her marginal benefit reduces from $100 to $50 from the first to the second good.



If a company has captured economies of scale, the marginal costs decline as the company produces more and more of a good. For example, a company is making fancy widgets that are in high demand. Due to this demand, the company can afford machinery that reduces the average cost to produce each widget; the more they make, the cheaper they become. On average, it costs $5 to produce a single widget, but because of the new machinery, producing the 101st widget only costs $1. Therefore, the marginal cost of producing the 101st widget is $1.






There are many considerations to make regarding what defines "marginal benefit". For example, that extra slice of pizza may not be physically healthy to consume, but it may provide emotional comfort or allow for a


   Limitations of Marginal Analysis  

Marginal analysis derives from the economic theory of marginalism—the idea that human actors make decisions on the margin. Underlying marginalism is another concept: the subjective theory of value. Marginalism is sometimes criticized as one of the "fuzzier" areas of economics, as much of what is proposed is hard to accurately measure, such as an individual consumers' marginal utility.



Also, marginalism relies on the assumption of (near) perfect markets, which do not exist in the practical world. Still, the core ideas of marginalism are generally accepted by most economic schools of thought and are still used by businesses and consumers to make choices and substitute goods.



Modern marginalism approaches now include the effects of psychology or those areas that now encompass behavioral economics. Reconciling neoclassic economic principles and marginalism with the evolving body of behavioral economics is one of the exciting emerging areas of contemporary economics.



Since marginalism implies subjectivity in valuation, economic actors make marginal decisions based on how valuable they are in the ex-ante sense. This means marginal decisions might later be deemed regrettable or mistaken ex-post. This can be demonstrated in a cost-benefit scenario. A company might make the decision to build a new plant because it anticipates, ex-ante, the future revenues provided by the new plant to exceed the costs of building it. If the company later discovers that the plant operates at a loss, then it mistakenly calculated the cost-benefit analysis.



That said, inaccurate calculations reflect inaccuracies in cost-benefit assumptions and measurements. Predictive marginal analysis is limited to human understanding and reason. When marginal analysis is applied reflectively, however, it can be more reliable and accurate.


   Example of Marginal Analysis in Manufacturing  

When a manufacturer wishes to expand its operations, either by adding new product lines or increasing the volume of goods produced from the current product line, a marginal analysis of the costs and benefits is necessary. Some of the costs to be examined include, but are not limited to, the cost of additional manufacturing equipment, any additional employees needed to support an increase in output, large facilities for manufacturing or storage of completed products, and as the cost of additional raw materials to produce the goods.



Once all of the costs are identified and estimated, these amounts are compared to the estimated increase in sales attributed to the additional production. This analysis takes the estimated increase in income and subtracts the estimated increase in costs. If the increase in income outweighs the increase in cost, the expansion may be a wise investment.



For example, consider a hat manufacturer. Each hat produced requires seventy-five cents of plastic and fabric. Your hat factory incurs $100 dollars of fixed costs per month. If you make 50 hats per month, then each hat incurs $2 of fixed costs. In this simple example, the total cost per hat, including the plastic and fabric, would be $2.75 ($2.75 = $0.75 + ($100/50)). But, if you cranked up production volume and produced 100 hats per month, then each hat would incur $1 dollar of fixed costs because fixed costs are spread out across units of output. The total cost per hat would then drop to $1.75 ($1.75 = $0.75 + ($100/100)). In this situation, increasing production volume causes marginal costs to go down.




Why Is Marginal Analysis Important?
Marginal analysis is important because it identifies the most efficient use of resources. An activity should only be performed until the marginal revenue equals the marginal cost; beyond this point, it will cost more for every unit that the benefit received for every unit.




What Is the First Step to Performing Marginal Analysis?
Though not required, a first step to performing marginal analysis is often to consider the fixed and variable components of an activity. If all costs are fixed, there will be little to no marginal costs as expenses will not change as units produced changed. On the other hand, if all costs are variable, there will be considerable expenses to factor in.The same, though less applicable, can be said about the benefit received. Because benefit often varies from the units consumed, it is hardly ever fixed. However, you can slowly advance to a full marginal analysis by considering how marginal benefit (and cost) change from one unit to the next.




What Is the Golden Rule for Marginal Analysis?
The golden rule of marginal analysis is that an activity should be performed as long as marginal revenue equals marginal cost. Activities that have marginal costs higher than marginal revenue provide negative net benefit to a company.




What Is Marginal Principle Theory?
Marginal principle theory is a very closely related topic that states that individuals make decisions on purchases based on the additional utility they will receive from each unit. In the example throughout this page, this related to the consumption of pizza. When you decide whether or not to reach for that one final slice, you are performing a marginal analysis and will ultimately make a decision that aligns with what is best for you (which upholds the marginal principle theory).


   The Bottom Line  

Marginal analysis is a critical part of a business and life that dictates what level of activity to operate at. Marginal analysis discovers the point at which marginal revenue equals marginal cost. If someone operates below this point, they may not be taking advantage of business opportunities. If someone operates above this point, they may lose resources every unit. Marginal analysis drives how many units a company produces and often decides what (and how much) consumers buy.
What Is Marginal Benefit?  

A marginal benefit is a maximum amount a consumer is willing to pay for an additional good or service. It is also the additional satisfaction or utility that a consumer receives when the additional good or service is purchased. The marginal benefit for a consumer tends to decrease as consumption of the good or service increases.



In the business world, the marginal benefit for producers is often referred to as marginal revenue.





Key Takeaways

Marginal benefits represent the maximum cost a consumer will pay for an additional good or service.A marginal benefit also represents the incremental satisfaction that a consumer receives when an additional good or service is purchased.The marginal benefit generally decreases as consumption increases.The marginal benefit of some products that are necessities, such as medication, does not decrease over time.Companies can use the research they conduct into marginal benefits for the best possible price point for any deal.

   Understanding Marginal Benefit  

Also referred to as marginal utility, a marginal benefit applies to any additional unit purchased for consumption after the first unit has been acquired. The term utility is used to describe the level of satisfaction a consumer has assigned to the unit being consumed.



Marginal benefit may be expressed as the number of dollars a consumer is willing to spend for additional units, or with imaginary units such as "utils." This assumes a consumer finds a minimum amount of intrinsic value equal to the dollar amount paid for the item.



For example, if a person purchases a burger for $10, it is assumed the consumer is obtaining at least $10 worth of perceived value from the item. If they are willing to purchase a second burger for $5, but not $6, then the marginal benefit from a second burger must be valued somewhere between $5 and $6 dollars.



Not all products are subject to change when it comes to their perceived value. For example, prescription medication can retain its utility over the long term as long as it continues to perform as needed. Additionally, the marginal benefits of certain staple goods, such as bread or milk, also remain relatively consistent over time.


   Law of Diminishing Marginal Benefit  

As units are consumed, the consumer often receives less utility or satisfaction from consumption.



To demonstrate this, consider the example above. Assume there is a consumer who wants to purchase an additional burger. If this consumer is willing to pay $10 for that additional burger, the marginal benefit of consuming that burger is equal to the initial $10 purchase.



However, if the consumer decides they are only willing to spend $9 on the second burger, the marginal benefit is $9. The more burgers the consumer has, the less they want to pay for the next one. This is because the benefit decreases as the quantity consumed increases.


   Formula for Marginal Benefit  

Marginal benefit can be determined using the slope of the demand curve or the following formula:









Marginal Benefit


=



Total additional benefit


Total number of additional goods consumed








\begin{aligned}\text{Marginal Benefit}=\frac{\text{Total additional benefit}}{\text{Total number of additional goods consumed}}\end{aligned}


Marginal Benefit=Total number of additional goods consumedTotal additional benefit​​


   Types of Marginal Benefits  

There are three possible value ranges for marginal benefits.


  Positive Marginal Benefits  

Most goods have a positive marginal benefit, meaning that the consumer feels a net benefit from consuming each additional unit of that good. Although the marginal benefit may diminish over time, the consumer still feels better off with additional consumption.


  Negative Marginal Benefits  

A negative marginal benefit means that the consumer is worse off if they consume an additional unit of the good. Examples include alcoholic drinks or unhealthy snacks, where additional consumption causes reduced satisfaction.


  Zero Marginal Benefits  

A good with zero marginal benefits is one where a consumer feels no change in satisfaction with additional consumption. This may be the case if a good has separate qualites that both improve and reduce satisfaction, resulting in no net benefit.


   Marginal Benefit and Unit Pricing  

Even though the consumer is willing to pay $10 for the burger, $10 is not necessarily the burger's price. The price is determined by market forces. The difference between the market price and the price the consumer is willing to pay—when the perceived value is higher than the market price—is called consumer surplus. This is not to be confused with economic surplus.



In cases where the consumer perceives the value of an item to be less than the market price, a consumer may end up not proceeding with the transaction.


   Marginal Benefits for Businesses  

Marginal benefits have applications for businesses, especially when it comes to marketing and research. Companies need to consider that a customer may compare the marginal cost of an additional purchase to the marginal benefit. A marginal cost is an additional cost incurred when producing a subsequent unit.



Going back to the example above, if a customer buys the first burger for $10 and a second at $9, they may place a marginal benefit of $9 on the second burger and may buy it given the marginal cost of $9. But if the customer gets full after only one burger, the marginal cost of $9 will outweigh the benefit, and they may not buy it.



Companies can use the research they conduct into marginal benefits for the best possible price point for any deal. Companies can also use this research to find out what the additional expenses are for selling a second item relative to the first.


   Marginal Benefit vs. Marginal Cost  

Marginal benefit is similar to the concept of marginal cost, the incremental cost for producers of creating additional units of a good. As with marginal benefits, marginal costs tend to decrease as the total number of units rises.



For example, imagine a hypothetical factory that produces paper cups. The production process requires $1 million of machinery, capable of producing up to 100,000 paper cups per day. In addition, the production process requires $1 in paper and glue as the materials for each paper cup.



If the factory currently produces less than 100,000 cups per day, the marginal cost for each additional cup is only $1. Fixed costs, such as machinery and facilities, are not included. However, if the factory is already working at full capacity, the marginal cost of producing more cups may be well over $1, reflecting the costs of additional machinery or changes to the production process.




How Do You Calculate Marginal Benefit?
The marginal benefit can be calculated from the slope of the demand curve at that point. For example, if you want to know the marginal benefit of the nth unit of a certain product, you would take the slope of the demand curve at the point where current consumption is equal to n. 




What Does Marginal Benefit Mean for Producers?
For manufacturers and other suppliers, the marginal benefit for a good represents the incremental profit that they can make by selling additional units of a certain good. This is not necessarily the same as the expected per-unit profit. For example, if a company decides to sell an additional 1,000 bottles of a soft drink, but expects half of them to go unsold, the marginal benefit would be half of the per-unit profit margin.




What Is the Principle of Diminishing Marginal Benefits?
The principle of diminishing marginal benefit, also known as the law of diminishing utility, states that the benefits of consuming a good decrease with additional consumption. Although each additional unit represents a net benefit from the consumer, the benefit is lower than the satisfaction received from prior consumption.


   The Bottom Line  

Marginal benefit represents one of the most basic concepts of microeconomics. This is the value, or satisfaction, that an economic actor gains from consuming additional units of a particular good. Marginal benefit also determines how much the consumer is willing to pay to consume more of a particular good.
What Is Marginal Cost?  

In economics, the marginal cost is the change in total production cost that comes from making or producing one additional unit. To calculate marginal cost, divide the change in production costs by the change in quantity. The purpose of analyzing marginal cost is to determine at what point an organization can achieve economies of scale to optimize production and overall operations. If the marginal cost of producing one additional unit is lower than the per-unit price, the producer has the potential to gain a profit.





Key Takeaways

Marginal cost is an important concept in managerial accounting, as it can help an organization optimize its production through economies of scale.A company can maximize its profits by producing to where marginal cost (MC) equals marginal revenue (MR).Fixed costs are constant regardless of production levels, so higher production leads to a lower fixed cost per unit as the total is allocated over more units.Variable costs change based on production levels, so producing more units will add more variable costs.Companies must be mindful of when increasing production necessitates results in step costs due to changes in relevant ranges (i.e. additional machinery or storage space needed).

   Marginal Cost Formula  

Marginal cost is calculated as the total expenses required to manufacture one additional good. Therefore, it can be measured by changes to what expenses are incurred for any given additional unit.



Marginal Cost = Change in Total Expenses / Change in Quantity of Units Produced



The change in total expenses is the difference between the cost of manufacturing at one level and the cost of manufacturing at another. For example, management may be incurring $1,000,000 in its current process. Should management increase production and costs increase to $1,050,000, the change in total expenses is $50,000 ($1,050,000 - $1,000,000).



The change in quantity of units is the difference between the number of units produced at two varying levels of production. Marginal cost strives to be based on a per-unit assumption, so the formula should be used when it is possible to a single unit as possible. For example, the company above manufactured 24 pieces of heavy machinery for $1,000,000. The increased production will yield 25 total units, so the change in quantity of units produced is one (25 - 24).



The formula above can be used when more than one additional unit is being manufactured. However, management must be mindful that groups of production units may have materially varying levels of marginal cost.


   Understanding Marginal Cost  

Marginal cost is an economics and managerial accounting concept most often used among manufacturers as a means of isolating an optimum production level. Manufacturers often examine the cost of adding one more unit to their production schedules.



At a certain level of production, the benefit of producing one additional unit and generating revenue from that item will bring the overall cost of producing the product line down. The key to optimizing manufacturing costs is to find that point or level as quickly as possible.



Marginal cost includes all of the costs that vary with that level of production. For example, if a company needs to build an entirely new factory in order to produce more goods, the cost of building the factory is a marginal cost. The amount of marginal cost varies according to the volume of the good being produced.



Marginal cost is an important factor in economic theory because a company that is looking to maximize its profits will produce up to the point where marginal cost (MC) equals marginal revenue (MR). Beyond that point, the cost of producing an additional unit will exceed the revenue generated.





Important

Economic factors that may impact marginal cost include information asymmetries, positive and negative externalities, transaction costs, and price discrimination.


   Benefits of Marginal Cost  

When a company knows both its marginal cost and marginal revenue for various product lines, it can concentrate resources towards items where the difference is the greatest. Instead of investing in minimally successful goods, it can focus on making individual units that maximum returns.



Marginal cost is also essential in knowing when it is no longer profitable to manufacture additional goods. When marginal cost exceeds marginal revenue, it is no longer financially profitable for a company to make that additional unit as the cost for that single quantity exceeds the revenue it will collect from it. Using this information, a company can decide whether it is worth investing in additional capital assets.



Marginal cost is also beneficial in helping a company take on additional or custom orders. Consider a company that sells a good for $50. It has additional capacity to manufacture more goods and is approached with an offer to buy 1,000 units for $40 each. Marginal cost is one component needed in analyzing whether it makes sense for the company to accept this order at a special price.


   Example of Marginal Cost  

Production costs consist of both fixed costs and variable costs. Fixed costs do not change with an increase or decrease in production levels, so the same value can be spread out over more units of output with increased production. Variable costs refer to costs that change with varying levels of output. Therefore, variable costs will increase when more units are produced.



For example, consider a company that makes hats. Each hat produced requires $0.75 of plastic and fabric. Plastic and fabric are variable costs. The hat factory also incurs $1,000 dollars of fixed costs per month.



If you make 500 hats per month, then each hat incurs $2 of fixed costs ($1,000 total fixed costs / 500 hats). In this simple example, the total cost per hat would be $2.75 ($2 fixed cost per unit + $0.75 variable costs).



If the company boosted production volume and produced 1,000 hats per month, then each hat would incur $1 dollar of fixed costs ($1,000 total fixed costs / 1,000 hats), because fixed costs are spread out over an increased number of units of output. The total cost per hat would then drop to $1.75 ($1 fixed cost per unit + $0.75 variable costs). In this situation, increasing production volume causes marginal costs to go down.



If the hat factory was unable to handle any more units of production on the current machinery, the cost of adding an additional machine would need to be included in marginal cost. Assume the machinery could only handle 1,499 units. The 1,500th unit would require purchasing an additional $500 machine. In this case, the cost of the new machine would need to be considered in the marginal cost of production calculation as well.






Marginal cost also has an impact on average cost. When marginal cost is less than average cost, the production of additional units will decrease the average cost. When marginal cost is more, producing more units will increase the average. cost per unit.


   Special Considerations  

Marginal cost is often graphically depicted as a relationship between marginal revenue and average cost. The marginal cost slope will vary across company and product, but it is often a "U" shaped curve that initially decreases as efficiency is realized only to later potentially exponentially increase.


  Internal vs. External Reporting  

Marginal cost is strictly an internal reporting calculation that is not required for external financial reporting. Publicly-facing financial statements are not required to disclose marginal cost figures, and the calculations are simply used by internal management to devise strategies.



In many ways, a company may be at a disadvantage by disclosing their marginal cost. Competitors would gain the advantage of knowing the company's cost structure, and the market could attempt to apply pressure to a company knowing the specific manufacturing levels where operations become unprofitable for other companies.


  Relevant Range  

Marginal cost highlights the premise that one incremental unit will be much less expensive if it remains within the current relevant range. However, additional step costs or burdens to the existing relevant range will result in materially higher marginal costs that management must be aware of.



Consider the warehouse for a manufacturer of landscaping equipment. The warehouse has capacity to store 100 extra-large riding lawnmowers. The margin cost to manufacture the 98th, 99th, or 100th riding lawnmower may not vary too widely. However, manufacturing the 101st lawnmower means the company has exceeded the relevant range of its existing storage capabilities. That 101st lawnmower will require an investment in new storage space, a marginal cost not incurred by any of the other recently manufactured goods.


  Pricing Strategy  

Marginal cost figures significantly into the marginal cost pricing doctrine, aka marginal cost theory, an economic principle that dictates that prices for products or rates for service should be predicated upon marginal costs for the purpose of economic efficiency.



The doctrine stems from political economist and professor Alfred E. Kahn's seminal work, The Economics of Regulation (1970 and 1971). “Under pure competition, price will be set at marginal cost” (the marginal price will equal the marginal cost)," Kahn wrote, and this results in “the use of society's limited resources in such a way as to maximize consumer satisfaction.”




What Is Marginal Cost?
Marginal cost is the cost to produce one additional unit of production. It is an important concept in cost accounting as marginal cost helps determine the most efficient level of production for a manufacturing process. It is calculated by determining what expenses are incurred if only one additional unit is manufactured.




What Is an Example of Marginal Cost?
Imagine a company that manufactures high-quality exercise equipment. The company incurs both fixed costs and variable costs, and the company has additional capacity to manufacture more goods.Let's say it cost the company $500,000 to manufacture 1,000 exercise bikes. The company has determined it will cost an additional $400 to manufacture one additional bike. Although the average unit cost is $500, the marginal cost for the 1,001th unit is $400. The average and marginal cost may differ because some additional costs (i.e. fixed expenses) may not be incurred as additional units are manufactured.




What Is the Formula for Marginal Cost?
Marginal cost is calculated by dividing the change in costs by the change in quantity. For example, suppose that a factory is currently producing 5,000 units and wishes to increase its production to 10,000 units. If the factory’s current cost of production is $100,000, and if increasing their production level would raise their costs to $150,000, then the marginal cost of production is $10, or ($150,000 - $100,000) / (10,000 - 5,000).




Why Is Marginal Cost Important?
Marginal cost is an economics concept that plays an important role in business management since it can help businesses optimize their production levels. It refers to the incremental cost of adding one more unit of production, such as producing one more product or delivering one more service to customers. It is generally associated with manufacturing businesses, although the concept can be applied to other types of businesses as well.




What Is the Difference Between Marginal Cost and Average Cost?
Marginal cost is the expenses needed to manufacture one incremental good. As a manufacturing process becomes more efficient or economies of scale are recognized, the marginal cost often declines over time. However, there is often a point in time where it may become incrementally more expensive to produce one additional unit.On the other hand, average cost is the total cost of manufacturing divided by total units produced. The average cost may be different from marginal cost, as marginal cost is often not consistent from one unit to the next. Marginal cost is reflective of only one unit, while average cost often reflects all unit produced.


   The Bottom Line  

During the manufacturing process, a company may become more or less efficient as additional units are produced. This concept of efficiency through production is reflected through marginal cost, the incremental cost to produce units. To maximize efficiency, companies should strive to continue producing goods so long as marginal cost is less than marginal revenue.
What Is Marginal Profit?  

Marginal profit is the profit earned by a firm or individual when one additional or marginal unit is produced and sold. Marginal refers to the added cost or profit earned with producing the next unit. Marginal product is the additional revenue earned while the marginal cost is the added cost for producing one additional unit.



Marginal profit is the difference between marginal cost and marginal product (also known as marginal revenue). Marginal profit analysis is useful for managers because it aids in deciding whether to expand production or to slow down stop production altogether, a moment known as a shutdown point.



Under mainstream economic theory, a company will maximize its overall profits when marginal cost equals marginal revenue, or when marginal profit is exactly zero.





Key Takeaways

Marginal profit is the increase in profits resulting from the production of one additional unit.Marginal profit is calculated by taking the difference between marginal revenue and marginal cost.Marginal profit analysis is helpful because it can help determine whether to increase or decrease the level of output.


   Understanding Marginal Profit  

Marginal profit is different from average profit, net profit, and other measures of profitability in that it looks at the money to be made on producing one additional unit. It accounts for the scale of production because as a firm gets larger, its cost structure changes, and, depending on economies of scale, profitability can either increase or decrease as production ramps up.



Economies of scale refer to the situation where marginal profit increases as the scale of production is increased. At a certain point, the marginal profit will become zero and then turn negative as scale increases beyond its intended capacity. At this point, the firm experiences diseconomies of scale.



Companies will thus tend to increase production until marginal cost equals marginal product, which is when marginal profit equals zero. In other words, when marginal cost and marginal product (revenue) is zero, there's no additional profit earned for producing an added unit.



If the marginal profit of a firm turns negative, its management may decide to scale back production, halt production temporarily, or abandon the business altogether if it appears that positive marginal profits will not return.


   How to Calculate Marginal Profit  

Marginal cost (MCMC) is the cost to produce one additional unit, and marginal revenue (MR) is the revenue earned to produce one additional unit.



Marginal profit (MP) = Marginal revenue (MR) - marginal cost (MCMC)



In modern microeconomics, firms in competition with each other will tend to produce units until marginal cost equals marginal revenue (MCMC=MR), leaving effectively zero marginal profit for the producer. In fact, in perfect competition, there is no room for marginal profits because competition will always push the selling price down to marginal cost, and a firm will operate until marginal revenue equals marginal cost; therefore, not only does MC = MP, but also MC = MP = price.



If a firm cannot compete on cost and operates at a marginal loss (negative marginal profit), it will eventually cease production. Profit maximization for a firm occurs, therefore, when it produces up to a level where marginal cost equals marginal revenue, and the marginal profit is zero.


   Special Considerations  

It is important to note that marginal profit only provides the profit earned from producing one additional item, and not the overall profitability of a firm. In other words, a firm should stop production at the level where producing one more unit begins to reduce overall profitability.



Variables that contribute to marginal cost include:



LaborCost of supplies or raw materialsInterest on debtTaxes



Fixed costs, or sunk costs, should not be included in the calculation of marginal profit since these one-time expenses do not change or alter the profitability of producing the very next unit.



Sunk costs are costs that are unrecoverable such as building a manufacturing plant or buying a piece of equipment. Marginal profit analysis does not include sunk costs since it only looks at the profit from one more unit produced, and not the money that has been spent on unrecoverable costs such as plant and equipment. However, psychologically, the tendency to include fixed costs is hard to overcome, and analysts can fall victim to the sunk cost fallacy, leading to misguided and often costly management decisions.



Of course, in reality, many firms do operate with marginal profits maximized so that they always equal zero. This is because very few markets actually approach perfect competition due to technical frictions, regulatory and legal environments, and lags and asymmetries of information.



Managers of a firm may not know in real-time their marginal costs and revenues, which means they often must make decisions on production in hindsight and estimate the future. Additionally, many firms operate below their maximum capacity utilization in order to be able to ramp up production when demand spikes without interruption.




Why Do Firms Care About Their Marginal Profit?
In order to maximize profits, a firm should produce as many units as possible, but the costs of production are also likely to increase as production ramps up. When marginal profit is zero (i.e., when the marginal cost of producing one more unit equals the marginal revenue it will bring in), that level of production is optimal. If the marginal profit turns negative due to costs, production should be scaled back.




When Should a Business Shut Down, When Considering Marginal Profit?
If marginal profit is negative at all levels of production, the firm's best course of action is probably to cease all production for the time being, rather than keep producing units at a loss.




What Are Economies of Scale?
Economies of scale refer to situations where ramping up production decreases the marginal cost. In such cases, the marginal profit will increase as more and more units are made.
What Is Marginal Propensity to Consume (MPC)?  

In economics, the marginal propensity to consume (MPC) is defined as the proportion of an aggregate raise in pay that a consumer spends on the consumption of goods and services, as opposed to saving it. Marginal propensity to consume is a component of Keynesian macroeconomic theory and is calculated as the change in consumption divided by the change in income.



MPC is depicted by a consumption line, which is a sloped line created by plotting the change in consumption on the vertical "y" axis and the change in income on the horizontal "x" axis.





Key Takeaways

Marginal Propensity to Consume is the proportion of an increase in income that gets spent on consumption. MPC varies by income level. MPC is typically lower at higher incomes.MPC is the key determinant of the Keynesian multiplier, which describes the effect of increased investment or government spending as an economic stimulus.

   Understanding Marginal Propensity to Consume (MPC)  

The marginal propensity to consume is equal to ΔC / ΔY, where ΔC is the change in consumption, and ΔY is the change in income. If consumption increases by 80 cents for each additional dollar of income, then MPC is equal to 0.8 / 1 = 0.8.












Investopedia / Julie Bang



Suppose you receive a $500 bonus on top of your normal annual earnings. You suddenly have $500 more in income than you did before. If you decide to spend $400 of this marginal increase in income on a new suit and save the remaining $100, your marginal propensity to consume will be 0.8 ($400 divided by $500).



The other side of the marginal propensity to consume is the marginal propensity to save, which shows how much a change in income affects levels of saving. Marginal propensity to consume + marginal propensity to save = 1. In the suit example, your marginal propensity to save will be 0.2 ($100 divided by $500).



If you decide to save the entire $500, your marginal propensity to consume will be 0 ($0 divided by 500), and your marginal propensity to save will be 1 ($500 divided by 500).


   MPC and Economic Policy  

Given data on household income and household spending, economists can calculate households’ MPC by income level. This calculation is important because MPC is not constant; it varies by income level. Typically, the higher the income, the lower the MPC because as income increases more of a person's wants and needs become satisfied; as a result, they save more instead. At low-income levels, MPC tends to be much higher as most or all of the person's income must be devoted to subsistence consumption.



According to Keynesian theory, an increase in investment or government spending increases consumers’ income, and they will then spend more. If we know what their marginal propensity to consume is, then we can calculate how much an increase in production will affect spending. This additional spending will generate additional production, creating a continuous cycle via a process known as the Keynesian multiplier. The larger the proportion of the additional income that gets devoted to spending rather than saving, the greater the effect. The higher the MPC, the higher the multiplier—the more the increase in consumption from the increase in investment; so, if economists can estimate the MPC, then they can use it to estimate the total impact of a prospective increase in incomes.




What Is Marginal Propensity to Consume in Simple Terms?
The marginal propensity to consume measures the degree to which a consumer will spend or save in relation to an aggregate raise in pay. Or, to put it another way, if a person gets a boost in income, what percentage of this new income will they spend? Often, higher incomes express lower levels of marginal propensity to consume because consumption needs are satisfied, which allows for higher savings. By contrast, lower-income levels experience a higher marginal propensity to consume since a higher percentage of income may be directed to daily living expenses.




How Do You Calculate Marginal Propensity to Consume?
To calculate the marginal propensity to consume, the change in consumption is divided by the change in income. For instance, if a person’s spending increases 90% more for each new dollar of earnings, it would be expressed as 0.9/1 = 0.9. On the other hand, consider a person receives a bonus of $1,000 and spends $100 of this while saving $900. The marginal propensity to consume would equal $100/$1,000 or 0.1.




What Role Does the Marginal Propensity to Consume Have in Economics?
In Keynesian macroeconomic theory, the marginal propensity to consume is a key variable in showing the multiplier effect of economic stimulus spending. Specifically, it suggests that a boost in government spending will increase consumer income, and in turn, consumer spending will rise. On a macro level, this increase in investment will lead to a higher aggregate level of demand.
What Is Marginal Propensity To Import (MPM)?  

The marginal propensity to import (MPM) is the amount imports increase or decrease with each unit rise or decline in disposable income. The idea is that rising income for businesses and households spurs greater demand for goods from abroad and vice versa.





Key Takeaways

The marginal propensity to import (MPM) is the change in imports induced by a change in disposable income.The idea is that rising income for businesses and households spurs greater demand for goods from abroad and vice versa.Nations that consume more imports as their population's income increases have a significant impact on global trade.Developed economies with sufficient natural resources within their borders typically have a lower MPM than developing countries without these resources.


   How Marginal Propensity To Import (MPM) Works  

MPM is a component of Keynesian macroeconomic theory. It is calculated as dIm/dY, meaning the derivative of the import function (Im) with respect to the derivative of the income function (Y).



The MPM indicates the extent to which imports are subject to changes in income or production. If, for example, a country's MPM is 0.3, then each dollar of extra income in that economy induces 30 cents of imports ($1 x 0.3). 



Countries that consume more imports as the income of their population rises have a significant impact on global trade. If a country that purchases a substantial amount of goods from overseas runs into a financial crisis, the extent to which that nation’s economic woes will impact exporting countries depends on its MPM and the makeup of the goods imported. 






An economy with a positive marginal propensity to consume (MPC) is likely to have a positive MPM because a portion of goods consumed is likely to come from abroad.



The level of negative impact on imports from falling income is greater when a country has a MPM greater than its average propensity to import. This gap results in a higher income elasticity of demand for imports, leading to a drop in income resulting in a more than proportional drop in imports. 


   Special Considerations  

Countries with developed economies and sufficient natural resources within their borders typically have a lower MPM. In contrast, nations that are dependent on purchasing goods from abroad generally have a higher MPM.


  Keynesian Economics  

The MPM is important to the study of Keynesian economics. First, the MPM reflects induced imports. Second, the MPM is the slope of the imports line, which means it is the negative of the slope of the net exports line and makes it important to the slope of the aggregate expenditures line, as well.



The MPM also affects the multiplier process and the magnitude of the expenditures and tax multipliers.


   Advantages and Disadvantages of Marginal Propensity To Import (MPM)  

MPM is easy to measure and functions as a useful tool to predict changes in imports based on expected changes in output.



The problem is that a country’s MPM will unlikely remain consistently stable. The relative prices of domestic and foreign goods change and exchange rates fluctuate. These factors impact purchasing power for goods shipped in from overseas and, as a consequence, the size of a country’s MPM.
What Is Marginal Propensity to Save (MPS)?  

In Keynesian economics theory, marginal propensity to save (MPS) refers to the proportion of an aggregate raise in income that a consumer saves rather than spends on the consumption of goods and services. Put differently, MPS is the proportion of each added dollar of income that is saved rather than spent. MPS is a component of Keynesian macroeconomics theory and is calculated as the change in savings divided by the change in income.


MPS = Change in Saving ÷ Change in Income



MPS is depicted by a savings line: a sloped line created by plotting change in savings on the vertical y-axis and change in income on the horizontal x-axis.





Key Takeaways

Marginal propensity to save (MPS) is the proportion of an increase in income that gets saved instead of spent on consumption.MPS varies by income level and is typically higher at higher incomes.MPS helps determine the Keynesian multiplier, which describes the effect of increased investment or government spending as an economic stimulus.


   Example of Marginal Propensity to Save (MPS)  

Suppose you receive a $500 bonus with your paycheck. You suddenly have $500 more in income than you did before. If you decide to spend $400 of this marginal increase on a new business suit and save the remaining $100, your marginal propensity to save is 0.2 ($100 change in saving divided by $500 change in income).


   Understanding Marginal Propensity to Save (MPS)  

Given data on household income and household saving, economists can calculate households’ MPS by income level. This calculation is important, because MPS is not constant; it can vary by income level. Typically, the higher the income, the higher the MPS, because as wealth increases, so does the ability to satisfy needs and wants; thus, each additional dollar is less likely to go toward additional spending. However, the possibility remains that a consumer might alter savings and consumption habits with an increase in pay.



Naturally, with an increase in salary comes the ability to cover household expenses more easily, allowing for more leeway to save. A higher salary also brings access to goods and services that require greater expenditures. This may include the procurement of higher-end or luxury vehicles or relocation to a new, pricier residence.



If economists know what consumers’ MPS is, they can determine how increases in government spending or investment spending will influence saving. MPS is used to calculate the expenditures multiplier using the following formula:


1/MPS



The expenditures multiplier tells us how changes in consumers’ MPS influences the rest of the economy. The smaller the MPS, the larger the multiplier and the more economic impact that a change in government spending or investment will have. 






The marginal propensity to consume (MPC) is the complement to MPS; added together, they should always equal one.


   Marginal Propensity to Consume (MPC)  

The other side of MPS is marginal propensity to consume (MPC), which shows how much a change in income affects purchasing levels.


MPC = Change in Spending ÷ Change in Income



Using the above example, where you spent $400 of your $500 bonus, the MPC is 0.8 ($400 divided by $500).



If you add MPC and MPS, the result should always equal one, making MPC the complement to MPS.




What does marginal propensity to save (MPS) describe?
Marginal propensity to save (MPS) refers to the amount of a raise in income that a person saves as opposed to spends.




What is marginal propensity to consume (MPC)?
Marginal propensity to consume (MPC) refers to the amount of a raise in income that a person spends as opposed to saves. This makes it the complement to MPS; added together, they should always equal one.




What is the purpose of determining MPS?
MPS can be used to understand how government spending and investment may influence saving and what the economic impact of the spending and investment might be.


   The Bottom Line  

Marginal propensity to save (MPS) is an economic theory that calculates how much of a raise a person would save. The number is different at different income levels and helps economists make theories about how individual incomes impact the broader economy.
What Is the Marginal Rate of Substitution (MRS)?  

In economics, the marginal rate of substitution (MRS) is the amount of a good that a consumer is willing to consume compared to another good, as long as the new good is equally satisfying.



MRS is used in indifference theory to analyze consumer behavior. When someone is indifferent to substituting one item for another, their marginal utility for substitution is zero since they neither gain nor lose any satisfaction from the trade.





Key Takeaways

The marginal rate of substitution (MRS) is the willingness of a consumer to replace one good for another good, as long as the new good is equally satisfying.The marginal rate of substitution is the slope of the indifference curve at any given point along the curve and displays a frontier of utility for each combination of "good X" and "good Y."When the law of diminishing MRS is in effect, the MRS forms a downward, negative sloping, convex curve showing more consumption of one good in place of another.MRS may not inform analysts of true utility as it assumes both products can be exchanged for the same utility.MRS is also limited in that it only considered two items; it does not consider how additional units may factor into different consumption preferences.

   What the MRS Can Tell You  

The marginal rate of substitution is a term used in economics that refers to the amount of one good that is substitutable for another and is used to analyze consumer behaviors for a variety of purposes. MRS is calculated between two goods placed on an indifference curve, displaying a frontier of utility for each combination of "good X" and "good Y." The slope of this curve represents quantities of good X and good Y that you would be happy substituting for one another.



MRS is a critical component for businesses to understand when analyzing consumption trends or for government entities to understand when setting public policy. Consider an example of a government wanting to analyze how offering electric vehicle incentives may spur more environmentally-friendly purchases. Understanding how MRS is impacted before and after a tax incentive can allow for the government to analyze the financial implications of the plan.


   MRS and the Indifference Curve  

The slope of the indifference curve is critical to the marginal rate of substitution analysis. MRS is the slope of the indifference curve at any single point along the curve. The slope will often be different as one moves along an indifference curve.



Most indifference curves are usually convex because, as you consume more of one good, you will consume less of the other. Indifference curves can be straight lines if a slope is constant, resulting in an indifference curve represented by a downward-sloping straight line.



If the marginal rate of substitution is increasing, the indifference curve will be concave to the origin. This is typically not common since it means a consumer would consume more of X for the increased consumption of Y (and vice versa). Usually, marginal substitution is diminishing, meaning a consumer chooses the substitute in place of another good, rather than simultaneously consuming more.






The law of diminishing marginal rates of substitution states that MRS decreases as one moves down a standard convex-shaped curve, which is the indifference curve.


   Example of MRS  

For example, a consumer must choose between hamburgers and hot dogs. To determine the marginal rate of substitution, the consumer is asked what combinations of hamburgers and hot dogs provide the same level of satisfaction.



When these combinations are graphed, the slope of the resulting line is negative. This means that the consumer faces a diminishing marginal rate of substitution: The more hamburgers they have relative to hot dogs, the fewer hot dogs they are willing to consume. If the marginal rate of substitution of hamburgers for hot dogs is -2, then the individual would be willing to give up 2 hot dogs for every additional hamburger consumption.

   Limitations of the MRS  

The marginal rate of substitution has a few limitations. The main drawback is that it does not examine a combination of goods that a consumer would prefer more or less than another combination. This generally limits the analysis of MRS to two variables. As this is most often graphically depicted using only x and y variables, other variables that may still factor consumption may not be appropriately considered.



MRS does not necessarily examine marginal utility since it treats the utility of both comparable goods equally, though in actuality they may have varying utility. In the example above, consider how the utility of a hamburger (with it's potential lettuce, onion, or other vegetable dressings) may vary from that of a plain hot dog.


   MRS vs. MRT  

Marginal rate of substitution is tied to the marginal rate of transformation (MRT). Whereas MRS focuses on the consumer demand side, MRT focuses on the manufacturing production side.



Often, the two concepts are intertwined and drive the other. For example, consider a global shortage of flour. A manufacturer may be more inclined to bake less cakes and more bread as bread is a more efficient product to make based on material constraints.



As a result, consumers may find cake shortages result in much higher prices. This may in turn result in a stronger MRS between cake and bread as consumers may be enticed by lower costs of the over-produced item. On the other hand, if consumers don't prove to have any reason to substitute bread for cake, a manufacturer may be handcuffed into producing a less-efficient good to meet market demand.




What Is the Relationship Between Indifference Curve and MRS?
Essentially, MRS is the slope of the indifference curve at any single point along the curve. Most indifference curves are usually convex because as you consume more of one good you will consume less of the other. So, MRS will decrease as one moves down the indifference curve.This is known as the law of diminishing marginal rate of substitution. If the marginal rate of substitution is increasing, the indifference curve will be concave, which means that a consumer would consume more of X for the increased consumption of Y and vice versa, but this is not common.




What are the Drawbacks of Marginal Rate of Substitution?
The marginal rate of substitution has a few limitations. The main drawback is that it does not examine a combination of goods that a consumer would prefer more or less than another combination. This generally limits the analysis of MRS to two variables. Also, MRS does not necessarily examine marginal utility because it treats the utility of both comparable goods equally though in actuality they may have varying utility. 




What Is Indifference Curve Analysis?
Indifference curve analysis operates on a simple two-dimensional graph. Each axis represents one type of economic good. The consumer is indifferent between any of the combinations of goods represented by points on the indifference curve because these combinations provide the same level of utility to the consumer. Indifference curves are heuristic devices used in contemporary microeconomics to demonstrate consumer preference and the limitations of a budget.


   The Bottom Line  

For economic and financial planning reasons, it's critical that various entities understand how consumers may substitute one good for other. This concept called marginal rate of substitution, measures the relationship between two products and how likely a consumer is to buy one in the place of the other. This information is useful in setting manufacturing levels or gauging public policy.
What Is the Marginal Rate of Technical Substitution – MRTS?  

The marginal rate of technical substitution (MRTS) is an economic theory that illustrates the rate at which one factor must decrease so that the same level of productivity can be maintained when another factor is increased.



The MRTS reflects the give-and-take between factors, such as capital and labor, that allow a firm to maintain a constant output. MRTS differs from the marginal rate of substitution (MRS) because MRTS is focused on producer equilibrium and MRS is focused on consumer equilibrium.





Key Takeaways

The marginal rate of technical substitution shows the rate at which you can substitute one input, such as labor, for another input, such as capital, without changing the level of resulting output.The isoquant, or curve on a graph, shows all of the various combinations of the two inputs that result in the same amount of output.

   How to Calculate the Marginal Rate of Technical Substitution – MRTS  

An isoquant is a graph showing combinations of capital and labor that will yield the same output. The slope of the isoquant indicates the MRTS or at any point along the isoquant how much capital would be required to replace a unit of labor at that production point.



For example, in the graph of an isoquant where capital (represented with K on its Y-axis and labor (represented with L) on its X-axis, the slope of the isoquant, or the MRTS at any one point, is calculated as dL/dK.


   What Does the MRTS Tell You?  

The slope of the isoquant, or the MRTS, on the graph shows the rate at which a given input, either labor or capital, can be substituted for the other while keeping the same output level. The MRTS is represented by the absolute value of an isoquant's slope at a chosen point.



A decline in MRTS along an isoquant for producing the same level of output is called the diminishing marginal rate of substitution. The figure below shows that when a firm moves down from point (a) to point (b) and it uses one additional unit of labor, the firm can give up 4 units of capital (K) and yet remains on the same isoquant at point (b). So the MRTS is 4. If the firm hires another unit of labor and moves from point (b) to (c), the firm can reduce its use of capital (K) by 3 units but remains on the same isoquant, and the MRTS is 3.

What Is the Marginal Rate of Transformation (MRT)?  

The marginal rate of transformation (MRT) is the number of units or amount of a good that must be forgone to create or attain one unit of another good. It is the number of units of good Y that will be foregone to produce an extra unit of good X while keeping the factors of production and technology constant.





Key Takeaways

MRT is the number of units that must be forgone to create or attain a unit of another good, considered the opportunity cost to produce one extra unit of something.MRT is also considered the absolute value of the slope of the production possibilities frontier.The marginal rate of substitution focuses on demand, while MRT focuses on supply.

​MRT=MCy​MCx​​where:MCx​=money needed to produce another unit of XMCy​=rate of increase by cutting production of Y​﻿



So, the ratio tells you how much Y you need to give up to produce another X. The marginal rate of transformation (MRT) is calculated as the marginal cost of producing another unit of a good divided by the resources freed up by cutting production of another unit. The MRT is the marginal cost of production for good X in the formula above, divided by the marginal cost of production for good Y.


   What the Marginal Rate of Transformation (MRT) Can Tell You  

The marginal rate of transformation (MRT) allows economists to analyze the opportunity costs to produce one extra unit of something. In this case, the opportunity cost is represented in the lost production of another specific good. The marginal rate of transformation is tied to the production possibility frontier (PPF), which displays the output potential for two goods using the same resources.



MRT is the absolute value of the slope of the production possibility frontier. For each point on the frontier, which is displayed as a curved line, there is a different marginal rate of transformation. This rate is based on the economics of producing the two goods.






It is possible to calculate the MRT for a variety of different goods, but the rates will differ depending on the goods compared. It follows that the MRT of X with respect to Y will usually be different from the MRT of X with respect to Z.



Producing more of one good means making less of the other because the resources are efficiently allocated at points on the production possibility frontier. In other words, resources used to produce one good are diverted from other goods, which means less of the other goods will be created. This tradeoff is measured by the marginal rate of transformation (MRT). Generally speaking, the opportunity cost rises (as does the MRT's absolute value) as one moves along (down) the PPF. As more of one good is produced, the opportunity cost (in units) of the other good increases. This phenomenon is similar to the law of diminishing returns.


   Example of How to Use the Marginal Rate of Transformation (MRT)  

The MRT is the rate at which a small amount of Y can be foregone for a small amount of X. The rate is the opportunity cost of a unit of each good in terms of another. As the number of units of X relative to Y changes, the rate of transformation may also change. For perfect substitute goods, the MRT will equal one and remain constant.



As an example, if baking one less cake frees up enough resources to bake three more loaves of bread, the rate of transformation is 3 to 1 at the margin. Or consider that it costs $3 to make a cake. Meanwhile, $1 can be saved by not making a loaf of bread. Thus, the MRT is 3, or $3 divided by $1.



As another example, consider a student who faces a tradeoff that involves giving up some free time to get better grades in a particular class by studying more. The MRT is the rate at which the student’s grade increases as free time is given up for studying, which is given by the absolute value of the slope of the production possibility frontier curve.


   The Difference Between the MRT and the Marginal Rate of Substitution (MRS)  

While the marginal rate of transformation (MRT) is similar to the marginal rate of substitution (MRS), these two concepts are not the same. The marginal rate of substitution focuses on demand, while MRT focuses on supply.



The marginal rate of substitution highlights how many units of Y would be considered by a given consumer group to be compensation for one less unit of X. For example, a consumer who prefers oranges to apples may only find equal satisfaction if she receives three apples instead of one orange.


   Limitations of Using the Marginal Rate of Transformation (MRT)  

The marginal rate of transformation (MRT) is generally not constant and may need to be recalculated frequently. Furthermore, goods will not be distributed efficiently if MRT doesn’t equal MRS.
What Is Marginal Revenue?  

Marginal revenue is the increase in revenue that results from the sale of one additional unit of output. While marginal revenue can remain constant over a certain level of output, it follows from the law of diminishing returns and will eventually slow down as the output level increases. In economic theory, perfectly competitive firms continue producing output until marginal revenue equals marginal cost.





Key Takeaways

Marginal revenue refers to the incremental change in earnings resulting from the sale of one additional unit.Analyzing marginal revenue helps a company identify the revenue generated from each additional unit sold.Marginal revenue is often shown graphically as a downward sloping line that represents how a company usually has to decrease its prices to drive additional sales.A company that is looking to maximize its profits will produce up to the point where marginal cost equals marginal revenue.When marginal revenue falls below marginal cost, firms typically do a cost-benefit analysis and halt production as it may cost more to sell a unit than what the company will receive as revenue.

   Understanding Marginal Revenue  

Marginal revenue is a financial and economic calculation that determines how much revenue a company earns in revenue for each additional unit sold. As the price of a good is often tied to market supply and demand, a company's marginal revenue often varies based on how many units it has already sold.



Marginal revenue is useful in several contexts. Companies use historical marginal revenue data to analyze customer demand for products in the market. They also use the information to set the most effective and efficient prices. Last, companies rely on marginal revenue to better understand forecasts; this information is then used to determine future production schedules such as material requirements planning.


   How to Calculate Marginal Revenue  

A company calculates marginal revenue by dividing the change in total revenue by the change in total output quantity. Ideally, the change in measurements captures the change from a single quantity to the next available quantity (i.e. the difference between the 100th and 101st unit sold). However, the formula above can still be used to capture the average marginal revenue across a series of units (i.e. the difference between the 100th and 115th unit sold).



The formula for marginal revenue can be expressed as:

Marginal RevenueMR​=Change in QuantityChange in Revenue​=ΔQΔTR​​



For example, a company sells its first 100 items for a total of $1,000. If it sells the next item for $8, the marginal revenue of the 101st item is $8. Marginal revenue disregards the previous average price of $10, as it only analyzes the incremental change. If it sells a total of 115 units for $1,100, the marginal revenue for units 101 through 115 is $100, or $6.67 per unit.






Positive marginal revenue is informative, but it does not convey enough information to a company for smarter decision-making. Marginal transaction information should include expenses to garner the most insight.


   Marginal Revenue Curve  

Like other related concepts, marginal revenue can be graphically depicted. It is most often represented as a downward slowing straight line on a chart capturing price on the y-axis and quantity on the x-axis.



The marginal revenue curve is often downward sloping because there is most often an economically inverse relationship between price and quantity. As a company decreases the price of its product, more units will likely be demanded; as the price is increased, demand often decreases.



For this reason, a company must often decrease its price to increase its market share. By decreasing its price, the company will receive less marginal revenue for each additional unit sold. At some point, the market demand for additional units will drive the product price so low that it becomes unprofitable to manufacture additional units.



In the graph below, marginal revenue is depicted by one of the blue lines. The quantity in which marginal revenue and marginal cost intersect is the optimal quantity to sell; the associated price point is noted as bullet E (where quantity per period and demand intersect).















Marginal Revenue Curve.
University of Minnesota


   Average Revenue Curve  

Marginal revenue can be analyzed by comparing marginal revenue at varying units against average revenue. Average revenue is simply the total amount of revenue received divided by the total quantity of goods sold.



In a perfect competition, marginal revenue is most often equal to average revenue. This is because collective market forces make each participant a price-taker. For example, the market may dictate that it is not profitable to sell a good below $10. However, charging more than $10 per unit puts a company at a disadvantage to other companies selling at that price.



In an imperfect competition, marginal revenue and average revenue will vary. This is because a firm must eventually lower its price to sell additional units. Both marginal revenue and average revenue tend to be downward sloping with marginal revenue often being the more steeper of the two lines. Consider an example where a company sells one good for $100. If it prices its second good at $90, its marginal revenue will be $90. However, its average revenue will be $95 (($100 + $90) / 2 units sold).



In the real world example shown graphically below, this is the theoretical average revenue and marginal revenue curve for an agricultural chemical producer in a monopolistic industry. Both marginal revenue and average revenue decrease as the firm lowers prices to sell more quantities, though marginal revenue decreases faster than average revenue.















Average Revenue Curve.
The Economics of Food and Agriculture Markets


   Example of Marginal Revenue  

To assist with the calculation of marginal revenue, a revenue schedule outlines the total revenue earned, as well as the incremental revenue for each unit. The first column of a revenue schedule lists the projected quantities demanded in increasing order, and the second column lists the corresponding market price. The product of these two columns results in projected total revenues, in column three.



The difference between the total projected revenue of one quantity demanded and the total projected revenue from the line below it is the marginal revenue of producing at the quantity demanded on the second line. For example, 10 units sell at $9 each, resulting in total revenues of $90; 11 units sell at $8.50, resulting in total revenues of $93.50. This indicates the marginal revenue of the 11th unit is $3.50 ($93.50 - $90).


   Marginal Revenue vs. Marginal Cost  

Any benefits gained from adding the additional unit of activity are marginal benefits. One such benefit occurs when marginal revenue exceeds marginal cost, resulting in a profit from new items sold. If the sale of one additional unit yields marginal revenue of $100 and marginal expenses of $80, the company will receive marginal profit of $20 for the additional item sold.



A company experiences the best results when production and sales continue until marginal revenue equals marginal cost. Beyond that point, the cost of producing an additional unit will exceed the revenue generated. If the company sells one additional unit for $100 but incurs marginal revenue of $105, the company will lose $5 in the process of selling that extra unit.



When marginal revenue falls below marginal cost, firms typically adopt the cost-benefit principle and halt production, as no further benefits are gathered from additional production.






A perfectly competitive firm can sell as many units as it wants at the market price, whereas the monopolist can do so only if it cuts prices for its current and subsequent units.


   Competitive Firms vs. Monopolies  

Marginal revenue for competitive firms is typically constant. This is because the market dictates the optimal price level and companies do not have much—if any—discretion over the price. As a result, perfectly competitive firms maximize profits when marginal costs equal market price and marginal revenue. Marginal revenue works differently for monopolies. For a monopolist, the marginal benefit of selling an additional unit is less than the market price. 



A firm's average revenue is its total revenue earned divided by the total units. A competitive firm’s marginal revenue always equals its average revenue and price. This is because the price remains constant over varying levels of output. In a monopoly, because the price changes as the quantity sold changes, marginal revenue diminishes with each additional unit and will always be equal to or less than average revenue.




What Is the Marginal Revenue Formula?
Marginal revenue is calculated as the change in revenue divided by the change in quantity for any two given levels of sales. The closer the two levels of sales, the more meaningful and precise the marginal revenue calculation will be.For example, imagine a company will make an additional $1,000 if it increases sales from 200 to 220 goods. The average marginal revenue received for each of these additional 20 units is $50/each. Should the company receive an additional $800 for increasing sales from 220 to 240, the average marginal revenue for these 20 units is $40/each.




Is Marginal Revenue the Same As Profit?
Marginal revenue only considers income received and does not reflect any marginal expenses required to manufacture or sell the goods. Therefore, marginal revenue is different from profit.




What Is Marginal Revenue and Marginal Cost?
Marginal revenue is the income gained by selling one additional unit, while marginal cost is the expense incurred for selling that one unit. Each measure the incremental change in dollars between varying levels of sales to determine at what level a company is most efficiently producing and selling goods.




Why Is Marginal Revenue Important?
Marginal revenue is important because it is a crucial indicator regarding the most idea level of activity a company should undertake. It is mathematically most ideal for a company to produce goods until marginal revenue is equal to marginal expenses; selling goods beyond this level usually means more expenses are incurred than revenue received for each good.




What Does It Mean If Marginal Revenue Is Negative?
If marginal revenue is negative, this means total revenue falls as additional units are sold. This may be the result of a company needing to cut prices to sell those additional units. In this case, strictly looking at just marginal revenue, it is more ideal for a company to have sold less goods but for a higher average price as more revenue would have been received.


   The Bottom Line  

Regardless of its sector, industry, or product line, companies must be aware of how increasing sales quantities impacts marginal revenue. If the company must decrease prices to generate additional sales, marginal revenue will slowly decrease to the point where it is no longer profitable to sell additional goods.
What Is Marginal Revenue Product (MRP)?  

Marginal revenue product (MRP), also known as the marginal value product, is the marginal revenue created due to an addition of one unit of resource. The marginal revenue product is calculated by multiplying the marginal physical product (MPP) of the resource by the marginal revenue (MR) generated. The MRP assumes that the expenditures on other factors remain unchanged and helps determine the optimal level of a resource.





Key Takeaways

Marginal revenue product (MRP) is the marginal revenue created by using one additional unit of resource.MRP is used to make critical decisions on business production and determine the optimal level of a resource.The MRP assumes that the expenditures on other factors remain unchanged.


   Understanding Marginal Revenue Product (MRP)  

American economist John Bates Clark (1847-1938) and Swedish economist Knut Wicksell (1851-1926) first showed that revenue depends on the marginal productivity of additional factors of production.



Business owners frequently use MRP analysis to make critical production decisions. For example, a farmer wants to know whether to purchase another specialized tractor to seed and harvest wheat. If the extra tractor can eventually produce 3,000 additional bushels of wheat (the MPP), and each additional bushel sells at the market for $5 (the price of the product or marginal revenue), the MRP of the tractor is $15,000.



Holding other considerations constant, the farmer is only willing to pay less than or equal to $15,000 for the tractor. Otherwise, he will take a loss. Estimating costs and revenues is difficult, but businesses that can estimate MRP accurately tend to survive and profit more than their competitors.


   Special Considerations  

MRP is predicated on marginal analysis, or how individuals make decisions on the margin. If a consumer purchases a bottle of water for $1.50, that does not mean the consumer values all bottles of water at $1.50. Instead, it means the consumer subjectively values one additional bottle of water more than $1.50 at the time of the sale only. The marginal analysis looks at costs and benefits incrementally, not as an objective whole.



Marginalism (or marginality) is a very important concept in economics. Several critical economic insights grew out of marginalism, including marginal productivity, marginal costs, marginal utility, and the law of diminishing marginal returns.



MRP is crucial for understanding wage rates in the market. It only makes sense to employ an additional worker at $15 per hour if the worker's MRP is greater than $15 per hour. If the additional worker cannot generate an extra $15 per hour in revenue, the company loses money.



Strictly speaking, workers are not paid in accordance with their MRP, even in equilibrium. Rather, the tendency is for wages to equal discounted marginal revenue product (DMRP), much like the discounted cash flow (DCF) valuation for stocks. This is due to the different time preferences between employers and workers; employers must wait until the product is sold before recouping revenue, but workers are generally paid much sooner. A discount is applied to the wage, and the employer receives a premium for waiting.



The DMRP directly affects bargaining power between workers and employers, except the rare theoretical case of monopsony. Whenever a proposed wage is below DMRP, a worker may gain bargaining power by shopping his labor to different employers. If the wage exceeds DMRP, the employer may reduce wages or replace an employee. This is the process by which the supply and demand for labor inch closer to equilibrium.
What Does Marginal Social Cost Mean?  

Marginal social cost (MSC) is the total cost society pays for the production of another unit or for taking further action in the economy. The total cost of the production of an additional unit of something is not merely the direct cost undertaken by the producer but also includes costs to other stakeholders and the environment as a whole. MSC is calculated as:

   Understanding Marginal Social Cost MSC  

Marginal social cost reflects the impact that an economy feels from the production of one more unit of a good or service.


   Marginal Social Cost Example  

Consider, for example, the pollution of a town’s river by a nearby coal plant. If the plant’s marginal social costs are higher than the plant’s marginal private costs, the marginal external cost is positive and results in a negative externality, meaning it produces a negative effect on the environment. The cost of the energy that is produced by the plant involves more than the rate that the company charges because the surrounding environment — the town — must bear the cost of the polluted river. This negative aspect must be factored in if a company strives to maintain the integrity of social responsibility or its responsibility to benefit the environment around it and society in general.


   Costs of Marginal Social Cost  

When determining the marginal social cost, both fixed and variable costs must be accounted for. Fixed costs are those that don’t fluctuate — such as salaries, or startup costs. Variable costs, on the other hand, change. For example, a variable cost could be a cost that changes based on production volume.


   The Issue With Quantification  

Marginal social cost is an economic principle that packs a major global punch, though, it is incredibly difficult to quantify in tangible dollars. Costs incurred by acts of production — such as operational costs and money used for startup capital — are fairly simple to calculate in tangible dollars. The issue comes when the far-reaching effects of production must also be factored in. Such costs are difficult, if not impossible, to pin down with an exact dollar amount, and in many instances, no price tag can be affixed to the effect.



The importance with marginal social cost, then, is that the principle can be used to aid economists and legislators to develop an operating and production structure that invites corporations to cut down on the costs of their actions.


   Related Concepts  

Marginal social cost is related to marginalism, a concept that works to determine the amount of extra use derived from the production of one additional unit. The effects of the extra units on supply and demand are also studied. Marginal social cost can also be compared to the marginal benefit, the principle that determines the amount that consumers will give up to gain one extra unit.
What Is a Marginal Tax Rate?  

The marginal tax rate is the tax rate you pay on an additional dollar of income. In the United States, the federal marginal tax rate for individuals increases as income rises. This means that your marginal tax rate will likely be lower than your tax bracket.



This method of taxation, known as progressive taxation, aims to tax individuals based upon their earnings, with low-income earners being taxed at a lower rate than higher-income earners.





Key Takeaways

The marginal tax rate is the tax rate paid on the next dollar of income.Under the progressive income tax method used for federal income tax in the United States, the marginal tax rate increases as income increases.Marginal tax rates are separated by income levels into seven tax brackets.


   Understanding Marginal Tax Rate  

Under a marginal tax rate, taxpayers are most often divided into tax brackets or ranges, which determine the rate applied to the taxable income of the tax filer. As income increases, the last dollar earned will be taxed at a higher rate than the first dollar earned. In other words, the first dollar earned will be taxed at the rate for the lowest tax bracket, the last dollar earned will be taxed at the rate of the highest bracket for that total income, and all the money in between is taxed at the rate for the range into which it falls.



Marginal tax rates can be changed by new tax laws. The current marginal tax rates went into effect in the United States as of Jan. 1, 2018, with the passage of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA). Under the previous law, the seven brackets were 10%, 15%, 25%, 28%, 33%, 35%, and 39.6%. The new plan, signed into law in Dec. 2017, keeps the seven bracket structure. However, adjustments were made to the tax rates and income levels.



Under the TCJA, the new rates are 10%, 12%, 22%, 24%, 32%, 35%, and 37%.


   Marginal vs. Flat Tax  

The other type of tax rate is the flat tax rate, which a few states implement for state income tax. Under this system of taxation, people aren’t taxed on a scale (like the marginal tax rate), but rather, flat across the board. In other words, everyone is charged the same rate, regardless of income level.



Most systems that use a flat tax rate do not allow for deductions and are seen in countries with a rising economy. Those who support this system of taxation describe it as fair, as it taxes all people and businesses at the same rate. Those who oppose it believe that it results in high-income taxpayers paying less than they should for an equitable society.


   Marginal Tax Rate Example  

The table below shows the rates and income levels for three types of filer in 2022: single, married filing jointly, and heads of household.

Individuals who make the lowest amount of income are placed into the lowest marginal tax rate bracket, while higher-earning individuals are placed into higher marginal tax brackets. However, the marginal tax bracket in which an individual falls does not determine how the entire income is taxed. Instead, income taxes are assessed progressively, with each bracket having a range of income values that are taxed at a particular rate. 



Under the current plan, if a single taxpayer earned $150,000 in taxable income, they would owe the following income taxes for 2022 (due in April 2023), as shown below:



10% Bracket: ($10,275 - $0) x 10% = $1,027.5012% Bracket: ($41,775 - $10,275) x 12% = $3,780.0022% Bracket: ($89,075 - $41,775) x 22% = $10,406.0024% Bracket: ($150,000 - $89,075) x 24% = $14,622.0032% Bracket: Not applicable35% Bracket: Not applicable37% Bracket: Not applicable



If you add up these amounts, the entire tax liability for this individual would be $3\29,835.50, or an effective tax rate of 19.9% = ($29,835.50 / $150,000).



The seven marginal tax rates of the brackets remain constant regardless of a person's filing status. However, the dollar ranges at which income is taxed at each rate change depending on whether the filer is a single person, a married joint filer, or a head-of-household filer. In addition, due to a provision in the tax code referred to as indexing, the dollar range of each marginal tax bracket typically increases annually to account for inflation.




What Is the Effective Tax Rate?
The effective tax rate is the percent of the income that an individual or a corporation pays in taxes. The effective tax rate for individuals is the average rate at which their earned income (such as wages) and unearned income (such as stock dividends) are taxed. The effective tax rate for a corporation is the average rate at which its pre-tax profits are taxed, while the statutory tax rate is the legal percentage established by law.




What Is the Difference Between Effective and Marginal Tax Rate?
The effective tax rate is a more accurate representation of a person's or corporation's overall tax liability than their marginal tax rate, and it is typically lower. When considering a marginal versus an effective tax rate, bear in mind that the marginal tax rate refers to the highest tax bracket into which their income falls. In a progressive income-tax system, like the one in the United States, income is taxed at differing rates that rise as income hits certain thresholds. Two individuals or companies with income in the same upper marginal tax bracket may end up with very different effective tax rates, depending on how much of their income was in the top bracket.




What Is a Flat Tax?
A flat tax, also known as a regressive tax, applies the same tax rate to every taxpayer regardless of income bracket. Typically, a flat tax applies the same tax rate to all taxpayers with no deductions or exemptions allowed, but proposals for allowing certain deductions are being considered. Most flat tax systems or proposals do not tax income from dividends, distributions, capital gains, or other investments.


   The Bottom Line  

The U.S. has a marginal tax rate system, whereby different tax brackets (with ever-increasing tax rates) kick in at different levels of income. This means that you are taxed at a certain rate for certain amounts of income that progressively get larger. So, if you make $1,000,000 a year and the tax bracket for that amount is 37%, you will not pay that percent on all one million dollars. Instead you will pay marginal rates for each tax bracket up to $539,900 of income (for single filers). Only the last $460,100 would be subject to the 37% rate.
What Is Marginal Utility?  

Marginal utility is the added satisfaction that a consumer gets from having one more unit of a good or service. The concept of marginal utility is used by economists to determine how much of an item consumers are willing to purchase.



Positive marginal utility occurs when the consumption of an additional item increases the total utility. On the other hand, negative marginal utility occurs when the consumption of one more unit decreases the overall utility.





Key Takeaways

Marginal utility is the added satisfaction a consumer gets from having one more unit of a good or service.The concept of marginal utility is used by economists to determine how much of an item consumers are willing to purchase.The law of diminishing marginal utility is often used to justify progressive taxes.Marginal utility can be positive, zero, or negative.

   Understanding Marginal Utility  

Economists use the idea of marginal utility to gauge how satisfaction levels affect consumer decisions. Economists have also identified a concept known as the law of diminishing marginal utility. It describes how the first unit of consumption of a good or service carries more utility than later units.






Although marginal utility tends to decrease with consumption, it may or may not ever reach zero depending on the good consumed.



Marginal utility is useful in explaining how consumers make choices to get the most benefit from their limited budgets. In general, people will continue consuming more of a good as long as the marginal utility is greater than the marginal cost. In an efficient market, the price equals the marginal cost. That is why people keep buying more until the marginal utility of consumption falls to the price of the good.


   Types of Marginal Utility  

There are multiple kinds of marginal utility. Three of the most common ones are as follows:


  Positive Marginal Utility  

Positive marginal utility occurs when having more of an item brings additional happiness. Suppose you like eating a slice of cake, but a second slice would bring you some extra joy. Then, your marginal utility from consuming cake is positive.


  Zero Marginal Utility  

Zero marginal utility is what happens when consuming more of an item brings no extra measure of satisfaction. For example, you might feel fairly full after two slices of cake and wouldn't really feel any better after having a third slice. In this case, your marginal utility from eating cake is zero.


  Negative Marginal Utility  

Negative marginal utility is where you have too much of an item, so consuming more is actually harmful. For instance, the fourth slice of cake might even make you sick after eating three pieces of cake.


   History of Marginal Utility  

The concept of marginal utility was developed by economists who were attempting to explain the economic reality of price, which they believed was driven by a product's utility. In the 18th century, economist Adam Smith discussed what is known as "the paradox of water and diamonds." This paradox states that water has far less value than diamonds, even though water is vital to human life.



This disparity intrigued economists and philosophers around the world. In the 1870s, three economists—William Stanley Jevons, Carl Menger, and Leon Walras—each independently came to the conclusion that marginal utility was the answer to the water and diamonds paradox. In his book, The Theory of Political Economy, Jevons explained that economic decisions are made based on "final" (marginal) utility rather than total utility.


   Example of Marginal Utility  

David has four gallons of milk, then decides to purchase a fifth gallon. Meanwhile, Kevin has six gallons of milk and likewise chooses to buy an additional gallon. David benefits from not having to go to the store again for a few days, so his marginal utility is still positive. On the other hand, Kevin may have purchased more milk than he can reasonably consume, meaning his marginal utility might be zero.



The chief takeaway from this scenario is that the marginal utility of a buyer who acquires more and more of a product steadily declines. Eventually, there is no additional consumer need for the product in many cases. At that point, the marginal utility of the next unit equals zero and consumption ends.


   Marginal Utility vs. Total Utility  

Marginal utility measures the change in satisfaction from consuming one additional unit. Total utility, instead, measures the total amount of satisfaction of you get from all the units you consume of a good or service. Marginal utility affects total utility. Positive marginal utility causes total utility to increase, while negative marginal utility decreases total utility.



For example, if you go to five sessions with a personal trainer, you might get the highest level of satisfaction from the novelty and excitement of the first session. With each additional session, the marginal utility decreases because you are less excited and doing more strenuous work. But the marginal utility of each is positive, so your total utility is still increasing.


   How to Calculate Marginal Utility  

You can calculate marginal utility by dividing the change in total utility (TU) by the change in number of units (Q):













Change in total utility is found by subtracting the previous total utility from the current total utility (TU2-TU1)). Change in number of units is found by subtracting the previous number of units from the current number of units (Q2-Q1).


   Applications of Marginal Utility  

Marginal utility is used to make a variety of economic decisions by governments, businesses, and consumers.


  Consumers  

Consumers seek out products with higher marginal utility. Because their satisfaction stays high with each additional unit purchased, they are more likely to purchase more. They are also more likely to buy similar products from the same company, expecting them to have a similarly high level of marginal utility.



Higher marginal utility often leads to greater customer satisfaction because consumers feel they are getting their money's worth. This can lead to brand loyalty over time, as well as word-of-mouth recommendations.


  Businesses  

Products that offer a higher level of satisfaction over time, and after the first time they are used, offer a higher level of marginal utility. This makes them more valuable to customers, so they can be priced higher for greater profits. This can also serve as a guide for businesses to create better products and increase customer satisfaction by focusing on products that offer higher marginal utility.



Marginal utility can also guide businesses when deciding which products to innovate or upgrade. A product or service that already has a high level of marginal utility becomes even more valuable when it is improved, allowing businesses to continue increasing the price over time or for newer models. For example, if a car manufacturer has an SUV that is already a top seller, they can create trim levels with additional features or upgrades. Because the original version is already popular, with a high marginal utility, customers are more likely to pay the increased price for an even more premium version.


  Governments  

The law of diminishing marginal utility is often used to justify progressive taxes. The idea is that higher taxes cause less loss of utility for someone with a higher income. In this case, everyone gets diminishing marginal utility from money. Suppose that the government must raise $10,000 from each person to pay for its expenses. If the average income is $60,000 before taxes, then the average person would make $50,000 after taxes and have a reasonable standard of living.



However, asking people making only $10,000 to give it all up to the government would be unfair and demand a far greater sacrifice. That is why poll taxes, which require everyone to pay an equal amount, tend to be unpopular.



Also, a flat tax without individual exemptions that required everyone to pay the same percentage would impact those with less income more because of marginal utility. Someone making $15,000 per year would be taxed into poverty by a 33% tax, while someone making $60,000 would still have about $40,000.




What Is the Formula for Marginal Utility?
The formula for marginal utility is change in total utility (ΔTU) divided by change in number of units (ΔQ): MU = ΔTU/ΔQ.




What Is the Law of Diminishing Marginal Utility?
The law of diminishing marginal utility is a law of economics that states that as your consumption increases, the satisfaction you derive from each individual unit decreases. This is why consumers are willing to pay the most for the first unit of something they buy, but after a point, they often will not buy additional units without a decrease in price.




What Is Marginal Cost?
Marginal cost is the change in production cost from producing or making one additional unit. You can find it by dividing the change in production costs by the change in quantity produced. If the price per unit is higher than the marginal cost, a business can make a profit. Tracking marginal costs allows businesses to achieve economies of scale.


   The Bottom Line  

Marginal utility is the amount of additional satisfaction that a consumer gets from having one more unit of a good or service. This amount can be positive, negative, or zero. When marginal utility equals zero or becomes negative, the consumer will stop buying because the value of what they are buying has stopped increasing.



As an economic concept, marginal utility can be used by businesses to understand customer behavior, set prices for goods and services, and decide which products to innovate or upgrade.



Marginal utility is also used in economics to justify progressive taxes. According to marginal utility, each additional dollar is more valuable to those with lower incomes because they have fewer dollars in total. For those with higher incomes, the marginal utility of each additional dollar of income is lower. This is an application known as the law of diminishing marginal utility.
What Is Marital Property?  

Marital property is a U.S. state-level legal term that refers to property acquired during the course of a marriage. Property that an individual owns before a marriage is considered separate property, as are inheritances or third-party gifts given to an individual during a marriage. Marriage partners may choose to exclude certain property from marital property by signing a prenuptial or a postnuptial agreement.



Some of the details described below won't affect a couple unless they divorce or until one of them dies. But it's important for couples to learn about the different types of marital property so that when they acquire real estate or other property, they know how ownership can be arranged and choose the structure that represents their true intentions.





Key Takeaways


Marital property refers to property that a couple acquires during their marriage.
Where a couple lives determines the laws that govern the distribution of marital property in the event of divorce.
In common law property states, property that is acquired by one spouse is considered their sole property unless the title or deed carries both spouses' names.
Nine states are community property states, where marital property acquired during the marriage is owned by both spouses equally.



   Understanding Marital Property  

Marital property includes real estate and other property a couple buys together during their marriage, such as a home or investment property, cars, boats, furniture, or artwork, when not acquired by either as separate property.﻿﻿ Bank accounts, pensions, securities, and retirement accounts are also included; even an Individual Retirement Account, which is individually owned by law, is marital property if earned income is contributed to it during the course of a marriage.



This legal definition of marital property primarily exists to protect spousal rights. A couple's permanent legal residence—in either a common law property state or a community property state—determines which laws govern their marital property and how it can be divided if their marriage ends in divorce.


   Common Law Property States vs. Community Property States  

Which type of state you live in generally determines what is considered to be marital property.


  Common law property states  

Most states are common law property states. The common law system provides that property acquired by one member of a married couple is owned completely and solely by that person. Under this legal framework, if the title or deed to a piece of property is put in the names of both spouses, the property belongs to both spouses. If both spouses' names are on the title, each owns a one-half interest. If a wife buys a car and puts it only in her name, for example, the car belongs to her only. If she buys the car and puts it in both her and her husband's names, however, the car belongs to both of them.



Under common law, when one spouse passes away, their separate property is distributed according to their will—or according to probate, if there is no will in effect. How this distribution pans out depends on which type of legal ownership the spouse has in any marital property. If they own property in "joint tenancy with the right of survivorship" or "tenancy by the entirety," the property goes to the surviving spouse. This right is independent of what the deceased spouse's will says. However, if the property was owned as "tenancy in common", then the property can go to someone other than the surviving spouse, per the deceased spouse's will. Not all property has a title or deed. In this case, generally, whoever paid for the property or received it as a gift owns it. In a legal separation or divorce in a common law state, the court can decide how marital property is divided according to its laws.


  Community property states  

Arizona, California, Idaho, Louisiana, Nevada, New Mexico, Texas, Washington, and Wisconsin are all community property states.﻿﻿ These nine states follow the rule that all assets acquired during a marriage are considered community property, that is, property of both spouses. According to the Internal Revenue Service, the states of Tennessee and South Dakota also have passed elective community property laws, along with Alaska and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.﻿﻿






Alaska has an "opt-in" community property law that allows such a division of property, providing both parties agree. Tennessee, South Dakota and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico have passed similar laws.



Marital property in community property states is owned by both spouses equally. This marital property includes earnings, all property bought with those earnings, as well as all debts accrued during the marriage. Earnings and debts acquired before the marriage are separate property, as is an inheritance of only one spouse, although the couple may co-mingle property if they choose.  Couples residing in community property states have to account for their community income as well as their separate income if they file separate federal tax returns. When one spouse dies, title of joint assets goes to the surviving spouse.



Community property begins at the marriage and ends when the couple physically separates with the intention of not continuing the marriage. Therefore, any earnings or debts originating after separation are considered separate property.


   Marital Property and Divorce  

If the couple divorces or obtains a legal separation and the former spouses can't decide how to divide their marital property, a court will decide for them. In non-community property states, assets are divided according to "equitable distribution."﻿﻿ In community property states, there are some exceptions to the equal division rule, including where a spouse misappropriates marital property before or during a divorce.﻿﻿



Of course, the couple can enter into a prenuptial agreement before the marriage, explaining how to distribute the marital property upon divorce. Usually, if the prenup is valid and doesn't violate federal or state laws, it will be followed—even in community property states.
What Is Maritime Law?  

Maritime law, also known as admiralty law, is a body of laws, conventions, and treaties that govern private maritime business and other nautical matters, such as shipping or offenses occurring on open water. International rules governing the use of the oceans and seas are known as the Law of the Sea.





Key Takeaways

Maritime law governs private maritime questions, disputes, or offenses and other nautical matters.In most developed countries, the maritime law follows a separate code and is an independent jurisdiction from national laws.The International Maritime Organization, or IMO, ensures that existing international maritime conventions are kept up to date and develops new agreements when the need arises.


   Understanding Maritime Law  

In most developed nations, maritime law follows a separate code and is an independent jurisdiction from national laws. The United Nations (UN), through the International Maritime Organization (IMO), has issued numerous conventions that can be enforced by the navies and coast guards of countries that have signed the treaty outlining these rules.






Conventions are regularly amended to keep up with new business practices and technologies.



Maritime law governs many of the insurance claims relating to ships and cargo; civil matters between shipowners, seamen, and passengers; and piracy. Additionally, maritime law regulates registration, license, and inspection procedures for ships and shipping contracts; maritime insurance; and the carriage of goods and passengers.



The IMO (established in 1948 as the Inter-Governmental Maritime Consultative Organization, and coming into force in 1958) is responsible for ensuring that existing international maritime conventions are kept up to date as well as developing new agreements as and when the need arises.



Today, there are dozens of conventions regulating all aspects of maritime commerce and transport. The IMO names three conventions as its core:



The International Convention for the Safety of Life at SeaThe International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from ShipsThe International Convention on Standards of Training, Certification, and Watchkeeping for Seafarers






On its website, the IMO has a complete list of existing conventions, historical amendments, and explanatory notes.



The governments of the 175 IMO member states are responsible for the implementation of IMO conventions for ships registered in their nation. Local governments enforce the provisions of IMO conventions as far as their ships are concerned and set the penalties for infringements. In some cases, ships must carry certificates onboard to show that they have been inspected and have met the required standards.


   History of Maritime Law  

The origins of maritime law can be traced all the way back to ancient Egypt. In those days, ships were used to transport goods and a clearly defined set of rules was needed to ensure safety and fair trade and settle disputes between different parties.



However, it wasn’t until much later that the first written record of formal codes can be found. The Rhodian Sea Laws, formed between 900 and 300 B.C., set official rules for the Mediterranean Sea. These laws governed seafaring trade in the area, influenced the Romans and remained in effect for a very long time.






The oldest maritime laws on record were reportedly created on the island of Rhodes, Greece.



European maritime laws gradually evolved over the following centuries. Key developments that helped to shape current laws included the Consulate of the Sea, the Rolls of Oléron, and the early English Admiralty laws, which would later help to shape the laws of the sea in the U.S.



Maritime law arrived in the U.S. in the 1600s. However, it wasn’t until 1789 that federal district courts were given jurisdiction over admiralty law cases and a uniform body of law was created.


   Ship Registration Under Maritime Law  

The country of registration determines a ship's nationality. For most ships, the national registry is the country where the owners live and operate their business.



Shipowners will often register their ships in countries that allow foreign registration. Called "flags of convenience," the foreign registration is useful for tax planning and to take advantage of lenient local laws. Two examples of "flags of convenience" countries are Panama and Bermuda.




What Is Maritime Law and Why Is it Important?
Maritime law is the body of rules that govern everything that goes on in the sea and open waters. These rules help clear up various disputes that can occur and ensure that the people and organizations that work on the water behave correctly and are protected.




Who Controls Maritime Law?
International maritime law is governed by the International Maritime Organization (IMO). A specialized agency of the United Nations, it is the IMO’s job to establish the framework and regulations for the safety, security, and environmental performance of shipping on an international, universal level.




What Is the Difference Between Maritime Law and Law of the Sea?
Maritime law generally applies to private shipping issues, whereas the law of the sea is largely recognized as referring to public international law. In other words, the latter governs how nations should behave in maritime environments.


   The Bottom Line  

The world’s open seas make up about 70% of the earth’s surface and are important, both as a means of transport and as a resource. Maritime law exists to protect this asset and the people who use it. Without it, there would likely be anarchy and collapse of the global economy.
Mark Zuckerberg is a self-taught computer programmer and co-founder, chair, and chief executive officer of Meta (META), formerly known as Facebook. Originally named Facemash, Zuckerberg founded the social networking site in his Harvard University dorm room in 2004 along with Andrew McCollum, Dustin Moskovitz, Chris Hughes, and Eduardo Saverin.



According to Bloomberg, Zuckerberg's net worth as of June 10, 2022, was about $68.2 billion.





Key Takeaways

   Early Life and Education  

On May 14, 1984, Mark Zuckerberg was born in White Plains, New York. As a child, he showed an affinity for computers. He learned the BASIC programming language at a nearby college, and at the age of 12, he developed an instant-messaging application that his father used in his office.



Zuckerberg attended Harvard University but dropped out after his sophomore year to focus on developing Facebook. The site grew out of two earlier ventures: FaceMash, a website for ranking the attractiveness of other Harvard students, and HarvardConnection.com, an online social networking platform.



In 2004, Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss and Divya Narendra, the three credited founders of HarvardConnection.com, sued Zuckerberg for allegedly stealing intellectual property from the website. They reached a multi-million dollar settlement of cash and stock options in 2008. The Winklevoss twins tried to reopen the lawsuit in 2011, but the court denied their request.


   Notable Accomplishments  
  Facebook IPO and Acquisitions  

In mid-2005, Facebook raised $12.7 million in venture capital and expanded access to hundreds of universities and high schools. One year later, the social network opened to the general public, and Yahoo! offered $1 billion to buy the company—a bid that was swiftly rejected by Zuckerberg.



In 2012, Facebook went public and became the most successful Internet initial public offering (IPO) in history when it raised $16 billion. That same year, Facebook bought the photo-sharing application Instagram, and Zuckerberg married Priscilla Chan in a surprise wedding the day after the IPO.



Meta has acquired dozens of companies over the years, including Instagram for $1 billion in 2012, WhatsApp for $22 billion in cash and shares in 2014, Oculus VR for $2 billion in 2014, and several other companies ranging from artificial intelligence (AI) to identification platforms.


  Wealth and Philanthropy  

Zuckerberg has made headlines for his philanthropy, including his 2010 donation of $100 million to help schools in Newark, N.J. In 2014, the publication Philanthropy ranked Zuckerberg and Chan the most generous American donors of the previous year, after they donated 18 million shares of Facebook stock to the Silicon Valley Community Foundation, in Mountain View, Calif.



On Dec. 1, 2015, Zuckerberg and Chan published a letter to their daughter Max, in which they announced the creation of the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative "to join people across the world to advance human potential and promote equality for all children in the next generation."



In the post, Zuckerberg and Chan said the "initial areas of focus will be personalized learning, curing disease, connecting people, and building strong communities" and that "we will give 99% of our Facebook shares—currently about $45 billion—during our lives to advance this mission."


  Controversy and Cambridge Analytica  

Meta has been accused, nearly since its inception, of collecting and selling the personal data, posts, and instant messages of its users. These accusations mounted shortly after the 2016 U.S. Presidential elections, with some alleging that U.S. voters had been under the influence of targeted ads financed by Russia. 



In March 2018, media outlets including The New York Times and The Observer reported that U.K.-based political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica had paid an outside researcher to collect data on 50 million Facebook users without their permission. The New York Times reported that Cambridge Analytica's goal was to use the data for its trademark "psychographic modeling," with the aim of "reading voters' minds" and potentially influencing the outcome of elections. 





$25 Billion

The estimated ad revenue of Instagram in 2021.



In April 2018, Facebook disclosed that the information of 87 million users had been improperly shared with Cambridge Analytica, and not the 50 million as earlier reported.



Later that month, Zuckerberg appeared on Capitol Hill to testify before House and Senate committees about Facebook's use of consumer data. In prepared remarks before the Senate, Zuckerberg noted that Facebook had been beneficial in connecting people during the #MeToo movement and various disasters.



The statement went on to say that Zuckerberg and Facebook heard about Cambridge Analytica's involvement from the media, just like everyone else. Zuckerberg also outlined actions that Facebook intended to undertake to prevent future incidents of this nature, including "safeguarding our platform," "investigating other apps," and "building better controls."




How Does Facebook Make Money?
Facebook makes the bulk of its money through ads. The company sells ad space on its many platforms. These platforms include Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp. Facebook (Meta) also makes money by allowing users to pay to promote their pages/posts on the various platforms, which is also a form of advertising.




What Is Mark Zuckerberg's Net Worth?
As of June 10, 2022, Mark Zuckerberg's net worth is $68.2 billion. He earned his wealth as the founder and largest shareholder of Meta (formerly Facebook).




Does Mark Zuckerberg Make $1 a Year?
Technically, Mark Zuckerberg makes a salary of $1 a year at Facebook. His wealth, however, is tied up in the shares of Meta (formerly Facebook), of which he is the largest shareholder, making him one of the richest men in the world.


   The Bottom Line  

Zuckerberg started Facebook from his dorm room, turning it into one of the largest companies in the world. Through Facebook and its many acquisitions, such as Instagram and WhatsApp, Zuckerberg controls the majority of the way consumers consume content and interact with one another.
What Is a Market?  

A market is a place where parties can gather to facilitate the exchange of goods and services. The parties involved are usually buyers and sellers. The market may be physical, like a retail outlet, where people meet face-to-face, or virtual, like an online market, where there is no physical presence or contact between buyers and sellers.



Some key characteristics help define a market, including the availability of an arena, buyers and sellers, and a commodity that can be purchased and sold.

   How Markets Work  

A market is any place where two or more parties can meet to engage in an economic transaction—even those that don't involve legal tender. A market transaction may include goods, services, information, currency, or any combination that passes from one party to another. In short, markets are arenas in which buyers and sellers can gather and interact.



Two parties are generally needed to make a trade. However, a third party is required to introduce competition and balance the market. As such, a market in a state of perfect competition, among other things, is characterized by a high number of active buyers and sellers.



Beyond this broad definition, the term market encompasses various things, depending on the context. For instance, it may refer to the stock market, which is the place where securities are traded. It may also describe a collection of people who wish to buy a specific product or service in a particular place, such as the Brooklyn housing market. Or it could refer to an industry or business sector, such as the global diamond market.



Certain decisions that help shape the market are determined by an economic system known as the market economy. In this system, factors like investments and the production, distribution, and pricing of goods and services are led by supply and demand from businesses and individuals. As such, a market economy is unplanned and is not part of a planned or command economy where the government dictates all of these factors. Examples of market economies include the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, and Japan.






The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regulates the stock, bond, and currency markets in the United States. It puts provisions in place to prevent fraud while ensuring traders and investors have the right information to make the most informed decisions possible.


  Supply and Demand  

Whatever the context, a market establishes the prices for goods and other services. These rates are determined by supply and demand. The idea of supply and demand is one of the very basics of economics. The sellers create supply, while buyers generate demand.



Markets try to find some balance in price when supply and demand are in balance. But that balance can be disrupted by factors other than price, including incomes, expectations, technology, the cost of production, and the number of buyers and sellers participating.



Simply put, the number of goods and services available is determined by what people want and how eager they are to buy. Sellers increase production when buyers demand more goods and services. Producers tend to raise their prices when demand increases. When buyer demand decreases, they drop their prices and, therefore, the number of goods and services they bring to market.


  Physical and Virtual Markets  

Markets may be represented by physical locations where transactions are made. These include retail stores and similar businesses that sell individual items to wholesale markets selling goods to distributors. Or they may be virtual. Internet-based stores and auction sites such as Amazon and eBay are examples of markets where transactions can occur entirely online, and the parties involved never physically connect.



Markets may emerge organically or as a means of enabling ownership rights over goods, services, and information. When on a national or more specific regional level, markets may often be categorized as developed or developing. This distinction depends on many factors, including income levels and the nation or region’s openness to foreign trade.






The size of a market is determined by the number of buyers and sellers and the amount of money that changes hands each year.


  Features of a Market  

Certain features help define a market and are necessary for it to function. The following are the most basic characteristics that shape a market:



Arena: This is the platform where transactions are conducted between buyers and sellers. Keep in mind that this doesn't necessarily mean a physical location.Buyers and Sellers: For the market to function, there must be buyers and sellers. The market can't exist if someone isn't buying something that someone else is selling. These entities can be businesses, individuals, or even governments, and they can execute their transactions physically or virtually, thanks to the internet.One Commodity: A single market depends on a single commodity, so a related commodity must be present for a market to operate. For instance, wheat is the commodity bought and sold in the wheat market. Electronics make up the electronics market en masse but can be broken down into subcategories.



Other features include competition, pricing, and the freedom to buy and sell goods and services.


   Types of Markets  

Markets vary widely for several reasons, including the kinds of products sold, location, duration, and size. The constituency of the customer base, size, legality, and other factors are equally influential. Aside from the two most common markets—physical and virtual—there are other kinds of markets where parties can gather to execute their transactions.


  Underground Market  

An underground or black market refers to an illegal market where transactions occur without the knowledge of the government or other regulatory agencies. Many illegal markets exist to circumvent existing tax laws. This is why many involve cash-only transactions or non-traceable forms of currency, making them harder to track.



Many illegal markets exist in economically developing countries with planned or command economies where the government controls the production and distribution of goods and services. When there is a shortage of specific goods and services in the economy, members of the illegal market step in and fill the void.



Illegal markets can also exist in developed economies. These shadow markets, as they're also known, become prevalent when prices control the sale of specific products or services, especially when demand is high. Ticket scalping is one example of an illegal or shadow market. When demand for concert or theater tickets is high, scalpers will step in, buy a bunch, and sell them at inflated prices on the underground market.


  Auction Market  

An auction market brings many people together for the sale and purchase of specific lots of goods. The buyers or bidders try to top each other for the purchase price. The items for sale go to the highest bidder.



The most common auction markets involve livestock, foreclosed homes, and art and antiques. Many operate online now. For example, the U.S. Treasury sells its bonds, notes, and bills via regular auctions.


  Financial Market  

The blanket term "financial market" refers to any place where securities, currencies, and bonds are traded between two parties. These markets are the basis of capitalist societies, providing capital formation and liquidity for businesses. They can be physical or virtual.



The financial market includes the stock exchanges such as the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), Nasdaq, the London Stock Exchange (LSE), and the TMX Group. Other financial markets include the bond and foreign exchange markets, where people trade currencies.


   Regulating Markets  

Other than underground markets, most markets are subject to rules and regulations set by governing body that determines the market’s nature. This may be the case when the regulation is as wide-reaching and as widely recognized as an international trade agreement or as local and temporary as a pop-up street market where vendors maintain order and rules among themselves.




How Do Markets Work?
Markets are arenas in which buyers and sellers can gather and interact. A high number of active buyers and sellers characterizes a market in a state of perfect competition. The market establishes the prices for goods and other services. These rates are determined by supply and demand. The sellers create supply, while buyers generate demand. Markets try to find some balance in price when supply and demand are in balance.




What Is a Black Market?
A black market refers to an illegal exchange or marketplace where transactions occur without the knowledge or oversight of officials or regulatory agencies. They tend to spring up when there is a shortage of specific goods and services in an economy or when supply and prices are state-controlled. Transactions tend to be undocumented and cash-only, all the better to be untraceable.




How Are Markets Regulated?
Most markets are subject to rules and regulations set by a regional or governing body that determines the market’s nature. They can be international, national, or local authorities.


   The Bottom Line  

Markets are an important part of the economy. They allow a space where governments, businesses, and individuals can buy and sell their goods and services. But that's not all. They help determine the pricing of goods and services and inject much-needed liquidity into the economy.



By offering a place to conduct transactions, markets allow entities access to the capital to further their interests, whether to fund infrastructure, fulfill growth plans, make purchases, or invest their money. This helps fuel innovation to secure a competitive edge in the marketplace.
What Is the Market Approach?  

The market approach is a method of determining the value of an asset based on the selling price of similar assets. It is one of three popular valuation methods, along with the cost approach and discounted cash-flow analysis (DCF).



Regardless of the type of asset being valued, the market approach studies recent sales of similar assets, making adjustments for the differences between them. For example, when appraising real estate, adjustments might be made for factors such as the square footage of the unit, the age and location of the building, and its amenities.






Because the market approach relies on comparisons to similar assets, it is most useful when there is substantial data available regarding recent sales of comparable assets.





Key Takeaways

The market approach is a method for determining the value of an asset.It is one of three popular approaches, along with the cost approach and discounted cash-flow analysis (DCF).The market approach excels in situations where abundant data is available on comparable transactions. When that data is not available, alternative approaches may be required.


   How the Market Approach Works  

As its name suggests, the market approach seeks to answer the question, “What is the fair market value of this asset?” To answer this question, the valuator needs to survey recent transactions involving similar assets. Because these assets are unlikely to be identical to the one being valued, various adjustments will need to be made.



In some markets, such as residential real estate or publicly traded shares, there is often ample data available, making the market approach relatively easy to employ. In other markets, such as shares in private businesses or alternative investments such as fine art or wine, it can become quite difficult to find comparable transactions.



In situations where limited data is available, the valuator may need to rely on alternative methods such as the cost approach or discounted cash flow analysis (DCF).



The primary advantages of the market approach are that it is based on publicly available data on comparable transactions. As such, it can require fewer subjective assumptions than alternative approaches. The primary disadvantage of the market approach is that it can be impractical in situations where few if any comparable transactions exist, such as in the case of a private company operating in a niche market with few competitors.


   Example of the Market Approach  

To illustrate, suppose you are in the market to purchase a new apartment. You find a listing for an apartment in your preferred neighborhood being offered for $200,000. The unit is a 1-bedroom, 1,000 square-foot apartment with 1 bathroom. It is in good structural condition but requires some minor renovations. Although it is in a desirable neighborhood, its view is obscured and it does not have an in-suite washing or drying machine. 



Although you like the apartment, you feel that the asking price is too high. Since the apartment has been listed for over a month, you begin to suspect that if you make a fair offer, the seller might accept it even if it is below their asking price.



To that end, you set about determining the apartment’s fair market value by looking up examples of similar apartments in the same neighborhood that sold in the last year. You assemble your findings in a table, as follows:

The market approach relies on data from comparable transactions.



Looking at these results, you begin to draw some general conclusions. To start with, you see that the apartments’ price per SF ranges between $140 and $275, with the higher prices belonging to those with more bedrooms and bathrooms, better views, in-suite appliances, and no need for renovations.



By contrast, the apartment you are seeking to purchase is priced at $200 per SF and has fewer of these features than even the cheapest priced apartment in your table. This seems to justify your intuition that the apartment is overpriced.



Based on this information, you decide to make an offer for $150,000.



The seller accepts your offer.
What Is a Market Basket?  

A market basket is a selected group of products or assets designed to track the general performance of a specific market segment. This is sometimes known as a basket of goods.



Market basket economics focuses on the Consumer Price Index (CPI), which tracks various consumer goods and uses their price levels to provide an estimate of inflation. However, for investors, a market basket relates to financial securities and is the principle idea behind index funds.



"Baskets" can also be found in securities markets, where program traders may enter into a series of positions in several stocks or currencies at the same time.





Key Takeaways

A market basket is a selected mix of goods and services that tracks the performance of a specific market or segment.A popular market basket is the Consumer Price Index (CPI), which provides an estimate for inflation based on the average change of price paid for a specific basket of goods and services over time.The CPI uses over 200 categories, including education, housing, transportation, and recreation, as an economic measure.A market basket analysis is used by retail stores to predict and increase impulse purchases based on groups of items a customer buys.


   How a Market Basket Works  

A market basket refers to a selection of goods and services that are consistently purchased and sold throughout an economic system. Economists, politicians, and financial analysts use market baskets to track price changes over time and determine inflation levels. The most well-known and widely used market basket is the CPI, which helps economists predict consumer purchase trends. This basket is used to track inflation in a specific market or country.



The financial system uses market baskets like the S&P 500 and index funds, which are essentially a broad sample of stocks, bonds, or other securities in the market. This provides investors with a benchmark against which to compare their investment returns.


   Special Considerations   

A market basket analysis is generally used in retail. It is based on the idea that most purchases are impulse buys, and the analysis attempts to predict what a customer might have purchased had the idea occurred to them.



Market basket analysts look at a group of items purchased by a customer and then try to determine what else that customer might buy if it was presented to them. Analysts use this information to decide where to locate items in a store, which demographics make certain purchases, what days of the week these purchases may be made, and what times of the year these customers spend the most money, among other considerations. 






Market basket analysis can be used to predict credit card purchases, phone calling patterns, insurance fraud, and more.


   Types of Market Baskets   

The CPI is an economic measure that looks at the average change in the price paid for a specific basket of goods and services over time. The CPI is used as a macroeconomic indicator, a deflating tool, and a way of adjusting monetary values over time. The CPI is not a cost of living index; instead, it is a measure of spending patterns and price levels for urban consumers and urban wage earners. The index, unlike various employment measures, takes into account the unemployed and the retired.



The market basket that the CPI uses is derived from information people provide regarding their spending habits. Over 200 categories of consumption within the CPI structure are analyzed to produce a mix of goods and services most representative of average purchases. Each category selected is given a weight regarding its proportion to the basket of goods. Some of the categories in the CPI's market basket include housing, transportation, recreation, apparel, and education.



The market basket used for the CPI also includes components outside the scope of consumer goods and services. Government fees of public goods, for example, like water and sewage, are included in the market basket. Taxes levied on the products and services already included in the market basket are also included. However, financial products like stocks and bonds are not included in the market basket. Essentially, the market basket represents all goods and services bought and sold by the population represented by the CPI.


   Real World Example of a Market Basket  

From 2020 to 2021, the CPI in the United States increased from 1.2% to 4.7%, which was the fastest rate of increase since 2017. The government credited this increase to the rising cost of gas, medical care, housing, and rent prices. This increase in the CPI implied inflation when prices in the basket of goods rose.



It is an indicator that people have confidence in the economy and are willing to spend. By monitoring the CPI and inflation, governments and central banks set monetary policies. Central banks of developed economies, including the Federal Reserve in the United States, generally aim to keep the inflation rate around 2%. After a long period of low interest rates, the Federal Reserve raised interest rates four times in 2018 to combat a strong economy and inflation. In June 2022 with the U.S. facing the highest inflation in 40 years, the Fed raised the rate by 75 basis points to 1.50%–1.75%.
What Is Market Breadth?  

Market breadth indicators analyze the number of stocks advancing relative to those that are declining in a given index or on a stock exchange, such as the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) or Nasdaq. Positive market breadth occurs when more stocks are advancing than are declining. This suggests that the bulls are in control of the market's momentum and helps confirm a price rise in the index. Conversely, a disproportional number of declining securities is used to confirm bearish momentum and a downside move in the stock index.



Certain breadth indicators also incorporate volume. They will not only look at whether a stock is advancing or declining in price, but also at the volume of those moves. This is because price moves on larger volume are considered to be more significant than price moves on lower volume.





Key Takeaways

Market breadth looks at the relative change of advancing to declining securities in a market.It is a technical analysis technique that gauges the strength or weakness of moves in a major index.When more stocks are advancing than declining, it suggests bullish market sentiment and confirms a broad market uptrend.Conversely, a large number of declining securities confirms bearish momentum and a downside move in the stock index.Certain breadth indicators also incorporate volume.


   Understanding Market Breadth  

Market breadth refers to how many stocks are participating in a given move in an index or on a stock exchange. An index may be rising yet more than half the stocks in the index are falling because a small number of stocks have such large gains that they drag the whole index higher.



Market breadth indicators can reveal this and warn traders that most stocks are not actually performing well, even though the rising index makes it look like most stocks are doing well—an index is an average of the stocks in it. Volume may also be added into these indicator calculations to provide additional insight into how stocks within an index are acting overall.



Market breadth attempts to find how much underlying strength or weakness there is in a given stock index. By assessing the strength or weakness, which isn't plainly visible by looking at a chart of the index, technical traders gain insight into what the index may do next.



A large number of advancing stocks is a sign of bullish market sentiment and is used to confirm a broad market uptrend. A large number of declining stocks shows sentiment is bearish, which would align with an index downtrend. When measuring market breadth, many indicators look at the number of advancing and declining stocks, or the number of stocks that have created a recent 52-week high or low. This data can provide information about whether an index uptrend or downtrend is likely to continue.






Traders use market breadth indicators to assess the overall health of a market/index. Market breadth indicators can sometimes provide early warning signs of a drop in the index, or forecast a coming rise in the index.


   Market Breadth Indicators and Uses  

There are a number of market breadth indicators. Each is calculated differently and therefore may provide slightly different information. Some indicators look at the number of advancing or declining stocks, others compare stock prices to another benchmark, and a few incorporate volume.



The tactic for most market breadth indicators is to monitor for confirmation and divergence. Confirmation is when the indicator is moving favorably and the index is rising. Divergence is when the index and indicator move in opposite directions. This warns that the index may see a reversal soon.






Market breadth indicators are poor timing signals. They may provide signals way too early or may not forecast an index reversal that does occur.



Here is a sampling of the market breadth indicators available.



Advance-Decline Index: This indicator, also known as the A/D line, calculates a running total of the difference between the number of advancing and declining stocks. Traders typically look for divergence between the indicator and a major market index, such as the Standard & Poor’s 500 index (S&P 500). For example, if the S&P 500 is rising and the A/D index is falling, it indicates the current uptrend in the index may be losing its momentum. On the other hand, if the S&P 500 is falling and the A/D index is rising, it suggests that the move lower in the index may be about to reverse.
New Highs-Lows Index: The new highs-lows indicator compares stocks making 52-week highs to stocks making 52-week lows. A reading below 50% indicates that more stocks are reaching their lows compared to stocks that are reaching their highs and could signal a move into a bear market. Contrarian investors may use this market breadth indicator to buy or sell stocks when it gives extreme readings, such as below 30% or above 70%.
S&P 500 200-Day Index: Traders can use this index to see what percentage of stocks in the S&P 500 are trading above their 200-day moving average. A rising indicator above 50% indicates broad market strength. Similar to the new highs-lows index, traders often look for extreme readings to find overbought and oversold conditions in the broader market. Short-term traders who want a more sensitive moving average to provide earlier signals can use a 50-day index that shows what percentage of stocks are trading above their 50-day moving average.
Cumulative Volume Index: This indicator measures volume. Stocks that rise have their volume added to the positive volume. Stocks that declined have negative volume. The indicator keeps a running total of whether the overall volume is positive or negative, and by how much, and is used in a similar fashion to the A/D line.
On-Balance Volume: This indicator also looks at volume, except up or down volume is based on whether the index rises or falls. If the index falls, the total volume is counted as negative. If the index rises, the total volume is negative. Each day is added or subtracted from prior readings to give a running total. It is used in a similar way to the A/D line.


   Example of Market Breadth Analysis in Action  

The following chart shows the SPDR S&P 500 (SPY) ETF along with the on-balance volume indicator and the cumulative volume index (for all US stocks).

During the rise in the S&P 500 on the left, the cumulative volume index confirmed the rise, as the indicator continued to make higher highs along with the S&P 500. On-balance volume told a different story, as the indicator was mostly flat, issuing a warning sign that there was some underlying weakness in the rise. This was followed by a steep price decline.



When the S&P 500 ETF rebounded, so did the market breadth indicators.




What is meant by market breadth?
Market breadth looks at the breadth of the market. It seeks to determine the strength of moves in an index, generally by examining the number of stocks that are rising relative to those that are declining.




What is market breadth and depth?
Market breadth studies the strength or weakness of moves in a major index. Market depth, on the other hand, is a market's ability to handle relatively large orders without significantly impacting the price of a security.




Is market breadth a good indicator?
Market breadth indicators derive their information from price and volume. They judge market sentiment. But like all indicators it is always best to confirm information with price. A good rule of thumb is to never base trading decisions on what the indicator is saying. Always confirm with price.


   The Bottom Line  

When investors use the phrase market breadth, they are talking about a set of technical indicators that evaluate price movements in a given stock index. Sometimes, an index may rise even though more than half of its constituents are falling. Market breadth indicators will let us know if this is the case.



The goal of market breadth is to determine the strength or weakness of moves in a major index. This information should be used to confirm what price action is doing. When more stocks are advancing than declining, it suggests the bulls are in control. Conversely, when more securities in the index are falling, it suggests the opposite. Because markets trend, rising or falling momentum may indicate rising or falling price trends.
What Is Market Cannibalization?  

Market cannibalization is a loss in sales caused by a company's introduction of a new product that displaces one of its own older products. The cannibalization of existing products leads to no increase in the company's market share despite sales growth for the new product.



Market cannibalization can occur when a new product is similar to an existing product, and both share the same customer base. Cannibalization can also occur when a chain store or fast food outlet loses customers due to another store of the same brand opening nearby.





Key Takeaways

Market cannibalization is a sales loss caused by a company's introduction of a new product that displaces one of its own older products.Market cannibalization can occur when a new product is similar to an existing product and both share the same customer base.Market cannibalization is sometimes a deliberate strategy to blow out the competition while other times, it's a failure to reach a new target market.Market cannibalization is measured by the cannibalization rate, the number of lost sales for old products as a percentage of new sales.Products with similar branding are most at risk of cannibalization. It is important to conduct thorough market research and testing to prevent cannibalization.


   How Market Cannibalization Works  

Also referred to as corporate cannibalism, market cannibalization occurs when a new product intrudes on the existing market for an older product. By appealing to its current customers instead of capturing new customers, the company has failed to increase its market share while almost certainly increasing its costs of production.



Marketing cannibalization is often done unintentionally when the marketing or advertising campaign for new products draws customers away from an established product. As a result, market cannibalization can hurt a company's bottom line.



However, market cannibalization can be a deliberate strategy for growth. A supermarket chain, for example, might open a new store near one of its older stores, knowing that they will inevitably cannibalize each other's sales. However, the new store will also steal market share from nearby competitors, even driving them out of business eventually.



Cannibalization as a marketing strategy is generally frowned upon by stock analysts and investors, who see it as a potential drag on short-term profits. As companies design their marketing strategies, marketing cannibalization needs to be avoided, and individual product sales need to be closely monitored to determine if cannibalization is occurring.



For example, when looking at the fast expansion of chains such as Starbucks or Shake Shack, these companies constantly weigh the opportunities for sales growth with the risks of local market cannibalization.


   Types of Market Cannibalization  
  Planned Cannibalism  

One familiar type of cannibalism occurs every year when companies like Apple and Samsung release new versions at the expense of older models. Although these new releases cut into sales of the older models, which may still be popular, they also attract new buyers from other brands.


  Cannibalization Through Discounts  

Many retailers regularly put products on sale, either to increase cash flow or to make room for newer products. But regular discounts can have a cannibalizing effect, if buyers start to expect routine discounts. If customers refuse to buy items at full price, the retailer may be forced to offer increasingly steep discounts.


  Cannibalization Through eCommerce  

Many traditional retailers now offer online sales, which could come at the expense of their brick-and-mortar stores. However, these losses could be a net benefit, if online shopping attracts new customers from outside the retailers' normal base.


   How to Prevent Market Cannibalization  

In order to prevent new products from cannibalizing on older ones, it is important to consider how the two products are branded. Products with similar pricing and placement—such as new flavors or added features—pose a high risk of market cannibalization, according to the Nuremberg Institute for Marketing Decisions.



This risk can be reduced through more distinctive branding—for example, creating inexpensive "fighting brands" to compete with low-cost competitors without cannibalizing from the premium brands. New offerings can also be carefully timed to avoid disrupting older offerings.


   When Market Cannibalism Is Unavoidable  

Sometimes, market cannibalism cannot be avoided. Every major department store now operates an online store, knowing full well that its sales can only cannibalize its brick-and-mortar business. Their only other choice is to allow internet retailers to continue taking market share away from them.



Macy's, as of 2021, is in the process of closing 125 brick-and-mortar stores nationwide, according to CNBC. Meanwhile, Amazon is busy opening a chain of convenience stores called Amazon Go. Will the new stores cannibalize the website? It's not likely since Amazon Go only sells items that can't be purchased on the website, namely ready-to-eat fresh meals.


   Advantages and Disadvantages of Market Cannibalization  

Market cannibalism is not always to be feared, especially if it can protect or expand a company's market share. Apple founder Steve Jobs is reported to have embraced the practice, saying: "If you don't cannibalize yourself, someone else will." Although the newly-released iPhone did cannibalize buyers from older iPods, they made a bigger dent in Apple's competitors.



Market cannibalization may also be an appropriate defensive measure against competitors, as when Airbnb started cutting into the margins of the hotel business. Marriott then started their own home rental business, which cannibalized from their own hotel revenue—but ultimately denied market share to Airbnb.



But there are also major risks to market cannibalism. High-end retailers should be cautious about introducing low-priced versions, which could dilute the value of their premium brands.



There is also a danger of market saturation, as might occur when two identical fast food restaurants appear on the same block. Depending on local market dynamics, the brand might end up competing against itself.



As with other marketing decisions, thorough market research and careful timing can make all the difference between positive and negative market cannibalization.





Benefits of Market Cannibalization

New offerings can revive interest in older product lines.
"Bargain" alternatives can prevent competitors from undercutting your core brand.



Risks of Market Cannibalization

Some bargain alternatives may dilute the value of premium brands.
Market saturation may occur when multiple venues compete for the same customers.





   Examples of Market Cannibalization  

Apple is an example of a company that has ignored the risk of market cannibalization in pursuit of larger objectives. When Apple announces a new iPhone, the sales of its older iPhone models immediately drop. However, Apple is counting on its new phone capturing competitors' current customers, increasing its overall market share.



Companies often risk market cannibalization in hopes of gaining a bounce in overall market share. For example, a company that makes crackers may introduce a low-fat or lower-salt version of its brand. It knows some of its sales will be cannibalized from the original brand, but it hopes to expand its market share by appealing to health-conscious consumers who otherwise would buy a different brand or skip the crackers altogether.





Cannibalization Rate.

Market cannibalization is measured by the Cannibalization Rate:Cannibalization Rate = 100 x (Lost sales on old product) / (Sales of new product)


   Product Cannibalization FAQs  
  Is Product Cannibalization Good or Bad?  

While product cannibalization is an expected consequence of launching a new product line. While a poorly planned entry may harm sales of existing products, a well-planned market launch can help a company gain more overall market share.


  How Can You Measure Product Cannibalization?  

Product cannibalization is represented by cannibalization rate, the percentage of new sales which occurred at the expense of old product lines. The cannibalization rate is calculated by dividing the lost sales for older products by the total sales of the new product.


  Why Is Product Cannibalization Important?  

Product cannibalization is an important factor in brand marketing. Since any new launch runs the risk of poaching customers from other product lines, it is essential to carefully research the market and conduct thorough testing to determine if the risks outweigh the benefits.
What Is Market Capitalization?  

Market capitalization refers to the total dollar market value of a company's outstanding shares of stock. The investment community uses this figure to determine a company's size instead of sales or total asset figures. In an acquisition, the market cap is used to determine whether a takeover candidate represents a good value or not to the acquirer.





Key Takeaways

Market capitalization refers to how much a company is worth as determined by the stock market. It is defined as the total market value of all outstanding shares.To calculate a company's market cap, multiply the number of outstanding shares by the current market value of one share.Companies are typically divided according to market capitalization: large-cap ($10 billion or more), mid-cap ($2 billion to $10 billion), and small-cap ($300 million to $2 billion).Market cap is often used to determine a company's size, then evaluate the company's financial performance to other companies of various sizes.In investing, companies with larger market capitalization are often safer investments as they represent more established companies with generally longer history in business.

   Understanding Market Capitalization  

Understanding what a company is worth is an important task and often difficult to quickly and accurately ascertain. Market capitalization is a quick and easy method for estimating a company's value by extrapolating what the market thinks it is worth for publicly traded companies. In such a case, simply multiply the share price by the number of available shares.



After a company goes public and starts trading on the exchange, its price is determined by supply and demand for its shares in the market. If there is a high demand for its shares due to favorable factors, the price would increase. If the company's future growth potential doesn't look good, sellers of the stock could drive down its price. The market cap then becomes a real-time estimate of the company's value.






One company's share price may be $50. Another company's share price may be $100. This does not mean the second company is twice as large as the first company. Always remember to factor in the number of shares issued (and thereby analyze the company's total market cap) when analyzing securities.


   How to Calculate Market Cap  

The formula for market capitalization is:



Market Cap = Current Share Price * Total Number of Shares Outstanding



For example, a company with 20 million shares selling at $100 a share would have a market cap of $2 billion. A second company with a share price of $1,000 but only 10,000 shares outstanding, on the other hand, would only have a market cap of $10 million.



A company's market cap is first established via an initial public offering (IPO). Before an IPO, the company that wishes to go public enlists an investment bank to employ valuation techniques to derive a company's value and to determine how many shares will be offered to the public and at what price.



For example, a company whose IPO value is set at $100 million by its investment bank may decide to issue 10 million shares at $10 per share or they may equivalently want to issue 20 million at $5 a share. In either instance, the initial market cap would be $100 million.


   Market Cap and Investment Strategy  

Given its simplicity and effectiveness for risk assessment, the market cap can be a helpful metric in determining which stocks you are interested in, and how to diversify your portfolio with companies of different sizes.



Large-cap (aka big-cap) companies typically have a market capitalization of $10 billion or more. These companies have usually been around for a long time, and they are major players in well-established industries. Investing in large-cap companies does not necessarily bring in huge returns in a short period of time, but over the long run, these companies generally reward investors with a consistent increase in share value and dividend payments. Examples of large-cap companies—and keep in mind that this is an ever-changing sample—are Apple Inc., Microsoft Corp., and Google parent Alphabet Inc.



Mid-cap companies generally have a market capitalization of between $2 billion and $10 billion. Mid-cap companies are established companies that operate in an industry expected to experience rapid growth. Mid-cap companies are in the process of expanding. They carry an inherently higher risk than large-cap companies because they are not as established, but they are attractive for their growth potential. One example of a mid-cap company is Eagle Materials Inc. (EXP).



Companies that have a market capitalization of between $300 million to $2 billion are generally classified as small-cap companies. These small companies could be younger and/or they could serve niche markets and new industries. These companies are considered higher-risk investments due to their age, the markets they serve, and their size. Smaller companies with fewer resources are more sensitive to economic slowdowns.



As a result, small-cap share prices tend to be more volatile and less liquid than more mature and larger companies. At the same time, small companies often provide greater growth opportunities than large caps. Even smaller companies are known as micro-cap, with values between approximately $50 million and $300 million. 


   Diluted Market Cap  

A security's market capitalization may change over time due to the outstanding number of shares. This is especially prevalent in cryptocurrency where new tokens or coins are issued or minted frequently.



Because new offerings theoretically thin the value of existing coins, tokens, or shares, a different market cap formula can be used to calculate what the potential market cap will be should all authorized shares or tokens be issued and still be worth the current trading price. This concept is referred to the diluted market cap, and the formula is:



Diluted Market Cap = Current Share Price * Total Number of Shares Authorized



For example, consider Bitcoin trading at roughly $24,000 per coin as of mid-August 2022. At the time of writing, there are also approximately 19.1 million Bitcoin issued. However, the total number of potential Bitcoin that may eventually be minted is 21 million. Therefore, Bitcoin's market cap calculations are:



Market Cap = $24,000 * 19.1 million = $458.4 billion



Diluted Market Cap = $24,000 * 21 million = $504 billion



Analysts use diluted market cap to better understand potential changes to a security, token, or coin's price. For example, imagine if all 21 million Bitcoin were minted tomorrow. If it were to retain the same market cap of $458.4 billion, the price would have to drop to roughly $21,828 ($458.4 billion / 21 million). Therefore, companies with large inventories of unissued securities or coins are at greater risk to face price decreases if investors wish to keep its market cap the same regardless of outstanding tokens.


   Misconceptions About Market Caps  

Although it is used often to describe a company, the market cap does not measure the equity value of a company. Only a thorough analysis of a company's fundamentals can do that. It is inadequate to value a company because the market price on which it is based does not necessarily reflect how much a piece of the business is worth. Shares are often over- or undervalued by the market, meaning the market price determines only how much the market is willing to pay for its shares.



Although it measures the cost of buying all of a company's shares, the market cap does not determine the amount the company would cost to acquire in a merger transaction. A better method of calculating the price of acquiring a business outright is the enterprise value.


   Changes in Market Cap  

Two main factors can alter a company's market cap: significant changes in the price of a stock or when a company issues or repurchases shares. An investor who exercises a large number of warrants can also increase the number of shares on the market and negatively affect shareholders in a process known as dilution.




What Is Market Capitalization?
Market capitalization refers to the market value of a company’s equity. It is a simple but important measure that is calculated by multiplying a company’s shares outstanding by its price per share. For example, a company priced at $20 per share and with 100 million shares outstanding would have a market capitalization of $2 billion.




What Does a High Market Cap Tell You?
A high market cap signifies that the company has a larger presence in the market. Larger companies may have less growth potential compares to start-up firms, but larger companies may be able to secure financing for cheaper, have a more consistent stream of revenue, and capitalize on brand recognition. Though applicable to every company, companies with higher market caps are generally less risky than companies with lower market caps.




Is It Better to Have a Large Market Capitalization?
There are advantages and drawbacks to having a large market capitalization. On the one hand, larger companies might be able to secure better financing terms from banks and by selling corporate bonds. Also, these companies might benefit from competitive advantages related to their sizes, such as economies of scale or widespread brand recognition.On the other hand, large companies might have limited opportunities for continued growth, and may therefore see their growth rates decline over time.




Does Market Cap Affect Stock Price?
Market cap does not affect stock price; rather, market cap is calculated by analyzing the stock price and number of shares issued. Although a blue-chip stock may perform better because of organizational efficiency and greater market presence, simply having a higher market cap does not directly impact stock prices.One could argue that analysts do track market cap to determine which companies may be undervalued or overvalued. In this lens, market cap can lead an investor to buy or sell shares based on the company's relative value compared to the industry or competitors. Still, the stock price of a share is determined as the fair value determined by the market, not by a company's market capitalization.




What Is the Importance of Market Cap?
Market cap demonstrates the size of a company. It is an important tool for analytics, especially when comparing companies. Market cap is often used as a baseline for analysis as all other financial metrics must be viewed through this lens. For example, a company could have had twice as much revenue as any other company in the industry. However, if the company's market cap is four times as large, the argument could be made that company is underperforming.


   The Bottom Line  

Market cap can be a valuable tool for an investor who is watching stocks and evaluating potential investments. Market capitalization is a quick and easy method for estimating a company's value by extrapolating what the market thinks it is worth for publicly traded companies. The investment community uses this figure to determine a company's size, as opposed to using sales or total asset figures. In an acquisition, the market cap is used to determine whether a takeover candidate represents a good value or not to the acquirer.
What Is the Stock Market Capitalization-to-GDP Ratio?  

The stock market capitalization-to-GDP ratio is a ratio used to determine whether an overall market is undervalued or overvalued compared to a historical average. The ratio can be used to focus on specific markets, such as the U.S. market, or it can be applied to the global market, depending on what values are used in the calculation. It is calculated by dividing the stock market cap by gross domestic product (GDP). The stock market capitalization-to-GDP ratio is also known as the Buffett Indicator—after investor Warren Buffett, who popularized its use.

The stock market capitalization-to-GDP ratio is a ratio used to determine whether an overall market is undervalued or overvalued compared to a historical average.If the valuation ratio falls between 50% and 75%, the market can be said to be modestly undervalued. Also, the market may be fair valued if the ratio falls between 75% and 90%, and modestly overvalued if it falls within the range of 90 and 115%.The stock market capitalization-to-GDP ratio is also known as the Buffett Indicator—after investor Warren Buffett, who popularized its use.


   What the Stock Market Capitalization-to-GDP Ratio Can Tell You  

The use of the stock market capitalization-to-GDP ratio increased in prominence after Warren Buffett once commented that it was "probably the best single measure of where valuations stand at any given moment."﻿﻿



It is a measure of the total value of all publicly traded stocks in a market divided by that economy's gross domestic product (GDP). The ratio compares the value of all stocks at an aggregate level to the value of the country's total output. The result of this calculation is the percentage of GDP that represents stock market value.



To calculate the total value of all publicly traded stocks in the U.S., most analysts use The Wilshire 5000 Total Market Index, which is an index that represents the value of all stocks in the U.S. markets. The quarterly GDP is used as the denominator in the ratio calculation.



Typically, a result that is greater than 100% is said to show that the market is overvalued, while a value of around 50%, which is near the historical average for the U.S. market, is said to show undervaluation. If the valuation ratio falls between 50% and 75%, the market can be said to be modestly undervalued.



Also, the market may be fair valued if the ratio falls between 75% and 90%, and modestly overvalued if it falls within the range of 90% and 115%. In recent years, however, determining what percentage level is accurate in showing undervaluation and overvaluation has been hotly debated, given that the ratio has been trending higher over a long period of time.



The market cap to the global GDP ratio can also be calculated instead of the ratio for a specific market. The World Bank releases data on the Stock Market Capitalization to GDP for World which was 92% in 2018.﻿﻿



This market cap to GDP ratio is impacted by trends in the initial public offering (IPO) market and the percentage of companies that are publicly traded compared to those that are private. All else being equal, if there was a large increase in the percentage of companies that are public vs. private, the market cap to GDP ratio would go up, even though nothing has changed from a valuation perspective.


   Example of How to Use the Stock Market Capitalization to GDP Ratio  

As a historical example, let's calculate the market cap to the U.S. GDP ratio for the quarter ended September 30, 2017. The total market value of the stock market, as measured by Wilshire 5000, was $26.1 trillion.﻿﻿ U.S. real GDP for the third quarter was recorded as $17.2 trillion.﻿﻿ The market cap to GDP ratio is, therefore:

In this case, 151.7% of GDP represents the overall stock market value and indicates it is overvalued.



In 2000, according to statistics at The World Bank, the market cap to GDP ratio for the U.S. was 153%, again a sign of an overvalued market. With the U.S. market falling sharply after the dotcom bubble burst, this ratio may have some predictive value in signaling peaks in the market.



However, in 2003, the ratio was around 130%, which was still overvalued, but the market went on to produce all-time highs over the next few years. As of 2020, the ratio stands at roughly 150%.
What Are Market Cycles?  

Market cycles, also known as stock market cycles, is a wide term referring to trends or patterns that emerge during different markets or business environments. During a cycle, some securities or asset classes outperform others because their business models are aligned with conditions for growth. Market cycles are the period between the two latest highs or lows of a common benchmark, such as the S&P 500, highlighting a fund’s performance through both an up and a down market. 





Key Takeaways

A cycle refers to trends or patterns that emerge during different business environments.A cycle time frame often differs for each individual person depending on what trends they are looking for.A market cycle often has four distinct phases.It can be almost impossible to identify what phase of the cycle we are currently in. At different stages of a full market cycle, different securities will respond to market forces differently.


   How Market Cycles Work  

New market cycles form when trends within a particular sector or industry develop in response to meaningful innovation, new products, or regulatory environment. These cycles or trends are often called secular. During these periods, revenue and net profits may exhibit similar growth patterns among many companies within a given industry, which is cyclical in nature.



Market cycles are often hard to pinpoint until after the fact and rarely have a specific, clearly identifiable beginning or ending point which often leads to confusion or controversy surrounding the assessment of policies and strategies. However, most market veterans believe they exist, and many investors pursue investment strategies that aim to profit from them by trading securities ahead of directional shifts in the cycle.






There are stock market anomalies that cannot be explained but occur year after year. 


   Special Considerations  

A market cycle can range anywhere from a few minutes to many years, depending on the market in question, as there are many markets to look at, and the time horizon which is being analyzed. Different careers will look at different aspects of the range. A day trader may look at five-minute bars whereas a real estate investor will look at a cycle ranging up to 20 years.


   Types of Market Cycles  

Market cycles are generally considered to exhibit four distinctive phases. At different stages of a full market cycle, different securities will respond to market forces differently. For example, during a market upswing, luxury goods tend to outperform, as people are comfortable buying powerboats and Harley Davidson motorcycles. In contrast, during a market downswing, the consumer durables industry tends to outperform, as people usually don't cut back their toothpaste and toilet paper consumption during a market pullback.



The four stages of a market cycle include the accumulation, uptrend or mark-up, distribution, and downtrend or markdown phases.



Accumulation Phase: Accumulation occurs after the market has bottomed and the innovators and early adopters begin to buy, figuring the worst is over.Mark-up Phase: This occurs when the market has been stable for a while and moves higher in price.Distribution Phase: Sellers begin to dominate as the stock reaches its peak.Downtrend: Downtrend occurs when the stock price is tumbling down.



Market cycles take both fundamental and technical indicators (charting) into account, using securities prices and other metrics as a gauge of cyclical behavior.



Some examples include the business cycle, semiconductor/operating system cycles within technology, and the movement of interest-rate-sensitive financial stocks.




How Long Is a Market Cycle?
Cycles in the market tend to have cycles lasting 6-12 months on average. However, fiscal policy in either the United States or world markets can have a widespread effect on the length of a market cycle. The average is 6 to 12 but if, for example, the Federal Reserve were to drastically cut interest rates, it could prolong a market trending upward for a period of years.




What Are the 4 Market Cycles?
There are four phases of market cycles: the accumulation phase, mark-up phase, distribution phase, and downturn phase. The first two phases could be considered mirror images of the others. Accumulation is when investors and businesses are scaling back into the market and increasing their exposure, whereas distribution is the opposite, and is a period when investors start shaving exposure from their positions. Mark-up is an increase in price while a downturn is a decrease.




What Is Market Mid-Cycle?
A market mid-cycle occurs when an economy is strong but growth is moderating or slightly slowing. Corporate profits are delivering as expected and interest rates are low. This tends to be the longest part of the market cycle.


   The Bottom Line  

Markets generally follow the same cycle and although there is an average period of time for each cycle, political and fiscal policy can either extend or contract certain phases. Financial markets experience many mini-cycles in the short term, but large market cycles tend to occur in terms of months or years.
What Is Market Depth?  

Market depth refers to a market's ability to absorb relatively large market orders without significantly impacting the price of the security. Market depth considers the overall level and breadth of open orders, bids, and offers, and usually refers to trading within an individual security. Typically, the more buy and sell orders that exist, the greater the depth of the market—provided that those orders are dispersed fairly evenly around the current market price of that security.





Key Takeaways

Market depth refers to the market liquidity for a security based on the number of standing orders to buy (bids) and sell (offers) at various price levels.In addition to price levels, market depth considers the order size, or volume, at each price level.The greater the market depth, the less likely that large trades will greatly impact a security's price.Market depth can be ascertained by looking at level 2 price quotes that can be found in a security's order book.


   Understanding Market Depth  

Market depth, or depth of market (DOM), is closely related to liquidity and volume within a security, but does not imply that every stock showing a high trade volume has good market depth. Market depth can be evaluated by looking at the order book of a security, which consists of a list of pending orders to buy or sell at various price levels. On any given day, there may be an imbalance of orders large enough to create high volatility, even for stocks with the highest daily volumes.






The decimalization of ticks on the major U.S. exchanges has been said to increase overall market depth, as evidenced by the decreased importance of market makers, a position needed in the past to prevent order imbalances.



Market depth is a derivative of all the orders that populate a security's order book at any given point in time. It is the amount that will be traded for a limit order with a given price—if it is not limited by size—or the least favorable price that will be obtained by a market order with a given size—or a limit order that is limited by size and not price.



Although a change in price may, in turn, attract subsequent orders, this is not included in market depth since it is an unknown. For example, if the market for a stock is "deep," there will be a sufficient volume of pending orders on both the bid and ask side, preventing a large order from significantly moving the price.



Depth of market also refers to the number of shares of a particular stock which can be bought without causing price appreciation. If the stock is extremely liquid and has a large number of buyers and sellers, purchasing a bulk of shares typically will not result in noticeable stock price movements.


   How Traders Use Market Depth Data  

Market depth data helps traders determine where the price of a particular security could be heading. For example, a trader may use market depth data to understand the bid-ask spread for a security, along with the volume accumulating above both figures.



Securities with strong market depth will usually have strong volume and be quite liquid, allowing traders to place large orders without significantly affecting the market price. Meanwhile, securities with poor depth could be moved if a buy or sell order is large enough.



Market depth data usually exists in the form of an electronic list of buy and sell orders known as the order book. These are organized by price level and updated in real-time to reflect current activity. In the past, this data used to be available for a fee, but nowadays most trading platforms offer some form of market depth display for free. This allows all parties trading in a security to see a full list of buy and sell orders pending execution, along with their sizes—instead of simply the best ones.



Real-time market depth data allows traders to profit from short-term price volatility. For example, if a company goes public and begins trading for the first time, traders can stand by for strong buying demand, signaling the price of the newly public firm could continue an upward trajectory.


   Example of Market Depth  

Consider the order book information in the image below, which displays the current bid-ask spread on the left, along with the market depth on the right. This type of quote is also known as level 2 market data.















Order Book for Market Depth.



The current quote in the security, MEOW shares, is $13.62 – $13.68, with 3,000 shares on the bid and 500 shares on the offer. The right panel indicates the depth of bids on the left. If all 3,000 shares were sold at $13.62, the next best bid would be $13.45, but only for 16 shares.



Should you have an order to sell 10,000 MEOW shares at the market, you would sell all the available bids down to $13.35, where there is a standing order to buy 43,500 shares. Selling 10,000 shares would thus move the market down nearly 30 cents, or about 2%. This indicates a low level of market depth.
What Are Market Dynamics?  

Market dynamics are forces that will impact prices and the behaviors of producers and consumers. In a market, these forces create pricing signals which result from the fluctuation of supply and demand for a given product or service. Market dynamics can impact any industry or government policy.



There are dynamic market forces other than price, demand, and supply. Human emotions also drive decisions, influence the market, and create price signals.





Key Takeaways

Market dynamics are the forces that impact prices and the behaviors of producers and consumers in an economy.These forces create pricing signals that result from a change in supply and demand.The basis of supply-side economics is on the theory that the supply of goods and services is most important in determining economic growth.Demand-side economics holds that the creation of economic growth is from the high demand for goods and services.Economic models cannot capture some dynamics which affect markets and increase market volatility, such as human emotion.


   Understanding Market Dynamics  

Market dynamics are the factors that change the supply and demand curves. They form the basis of many economic models and theories. Because market dynamics impact the supply and demand curves, policymakers aim to determine the best way to use various financial tools to stimulate or cool down an economy. Is it better to raise or lower taxes, increase wages or slow down wage growth, do neither, or do both? How will these adjustments affect supply and demand and the general direction of the economy?



There are two primary economic approaches when it comes to changing the supply or demand in an economy with the ultimate goal of impacting the economy positively. One has a basis on supply-side theory and the other has a demand-side base.


   Dynamics of Supply-Side Economics  

Supply-side economics, also known as "Reaganomics," or "trickle-down economics" is a policy made famous by the 40th U.S. President, Ronald Reagan, based on the theory that more significant tax cuts for investors, corporations, and entrepreneurs provide incentives for investors to supply more goods to an economy, which results in other added benefits that trickle down to the rest of the economy.



The supply-side theory has three pillars which are tax policy, regulatory policy, and monetary policy. However, the overall concept is that production, or the supply of goods and services, is most important in determining economic growth. The supply-side theory contrasts with Keynesian theory, which considers that demand for products and services can drop and, in that case, the government should intervene with fiscal and monetary stimuli.


   Dynamics of Demand-Side Economics  

The opposite of supply-side economics is demand-side economics, which argues that the creation of effective economic growth comes from the high demand for products and services. If there is a high demand for goods and services, consumer spending grows, and businesses can expand and employ additional workers. Higher levels of employment further stimulate aggregate demand and economic growth.



Demand-side economists believe tax cuts in general can stimulate aggregate demand and move an economy that has significant unemployment back towards a full employment scenario. However, tax cuts specifically for corporations and the wealthy may not end up stimulating the economy. In this case, the additional funds may not increase the demand for goods or services. Instead, it could be argued that the incremental income generated may go back into stock buybacks that boost the market value of the stock or to executive benefits but do not end up materially stimulating the economy.






Market dynamics are not constant but always fluctuating, so it is necessary to constantly reevaluate them before making any investment or business decisions.



Demand-side economists argue that increased government spending will help to grow the economy by spurring additional employment opportunities. They use the Great Depression of the 1930s as evidence that increased government spending stimulates growth at a greater rate than do tax cuts.


   Dynamics of Securities Markets  

Economic models and theories attempt to account for market dynamics in a way that captures as many relevant variables as possible. However, not all variables are easily quantifiable.



Models of markets for physical goods or services with relatively straightforward dynamics are, for the most part, efficient, and participants in these markets are assumed to make rational decisions. However, in financial markets, the human element of emotion creates a chaotic and difficult-to-quantify effect that always results in increased volatility.



In financial markets, some, but not all, financial services professionals are knowledgeable about how markets work. These professionals make rational decisions that are in the best interests of their clients based on all of the available information.



Savvy professionals base their decisions on comprehensive analysis, extensive experience, and proven techniques. They also work to fully understand their client's needs, goals, time horizons, and ability to withstand investment risks.



Unfortunately, some market participants are not professionals and possess limited knowledge of the markets and the various events that can impact the market.



This segment of nonprofessionals includes small-to-intermediate traders who seek to “get-rich-quick,” scam artists, driven by personal greed, and investors who attempt to manage their investments rather than seek professional advice. Some in this category of experts are self-proclaimed professionals who are, at times, dishonest.


  Greed and Fear in the Markets  

Competent and professional traders determine entry and exit points of any investment or trade using proven quantitative models or techniques. They define the appropriate plan of action and follow it exactly. Through the practice of strict money management, the execution of trades happens without deviating from the well thought out, predetermined plan. Emotion seldom influences the decision-making process of these traders.






The government has the most impact when it comes to creating demand on a national level due to its ability to affect various factors, such as taxes and interest rates.



Conversely, for the novice investor or trader, emotion frequently plays a role in their decision-making process. After the execution of a trade, if it becomes profitable, greed may influence their next move.



These traders will ignore indicators and, at times, not take profits turning a winning trade into a losing one. Fear is another emotion that can drive the decisions of these investors. They may fail to exit a trade at a predetermined stop loss. These are examples of irrational emotional behavior that is difficult to capture in economic models, thus difficult to know how market dynamics will impact supply and demand.


   Real-World Example  

Consumer demand can at times be a powerful market dynamic. As explained in a study by The NPD Group, consumer spending is on the increase, particularly for luxury fashion items, such as footwear, accessories, and apparel.



According to the January 2019 NPD study, sales of luxury fashion items have increased as new brands have emerged and online retail platforms have created a more competitive landscape while gaining market share due to buyer demographics and preferences.



As demand for luxury apparel increases, manufacturers and brands will be able to raise prices, which will stimulate the industry and boost the overall economy.



According to Marshal Cohen, chief industry advisor, The NPD Group, “If we pay attention to what consumers are saying, these new market dynamics spell a great deal of opportunity across the entire luxury fashion market.”
What Is a Market Economy?  

A market economy is an economic system in which economic decisions and the pricing of goods and services are guided by the interactions of a country's individual citizens and businesses. There may be some government intervention or central planning, but usually this term refers to an economy that is more market oriented in general.





Key Takeaways

In a market economy, most economic decision making is done through voluntary transactions according to the laws of supply and demand.A market economy gives entrepreneurs the freedom to pursue profit by creating outputs that are more valuable than the inputs they use up, and free to fail and go out of business if they do not.Economists broadly agree that market-oriented economies produce better economic outcomes, but differ on the precise balance between markets and central planning that is best for a nation's long-term wellbeing.












Investopedia / Mira Norian


   Understanding Market Economies  

The theoretical basis for market economies was developed by classical economists, such as Adam Smith, David Ricardo, and Jean-Baptiste Say. These classically liberal free market advocates believed that the “invisible hand” of the profit motive and market incentives generally guided economic decisions down more productive and efficient paths than government planning of the economy. They believed that government intervention often tended to lead to economic inefficiencies that actually made people worse off.


   Market Theory  

Market economies work using the forces of supply and demand to determine the appropriate prices and quantities for most goods and services in the economy. Entrepreneurs marshal factors of production (land, labor, and capital) and combine them in cooperation with workers and financial backers, to produce goods and services for consumers or other businesses to buy. Buyers and sellers agree on the terms of these transactions voluntarily based on consumers preferences for various goods and the revenues that businesses want to earn on their investments. The allocation of resources by entrepreneurs across different businesses and production processes is determined by the profits they hope to make by producing output that their customers will value beyond what the entrepreneurs paid for the inputs. Entrepreneurs that successfully do so are rewarded with profits that they can reinvest in future business, and those who fail to do so either learn to improve over time or go out of business.


   Modern Market Economies  

Every economy in the modern world falls somewhere along a continuum running from pure market to fully planned. Most developed nations are technically mixed economies because they blend free markets with some government interference. However, they are often said to have market economies because they allow market forces to drive the vast majority of activities, typically engaging in government intervention only to the extent it is needed to provide stability.



Market economies may still engage in some government interventions, such as price-fixing, licensing, quotas, and industrial subsidies. Most commonly, market economies feature government production of public goods, often as a government monopoly. But overall, market economies are characterized by decentralized economic decision making by buyers and sellers transacting everyday business. In particular, market economies can be distinguished by having functional markets for corporate control, which allow for the transfer and reorganization of the economic means of production among entrepreneurs.



Although the market economy is clearly the popular system of choice, there is significant debate regarding the amount of government intervention considered optimal for efficient economic operations. Economists mostly believe that more market oriented economies will be rather successful at generating wealth, economic growth, and rising living standards, but often differ on the precise scope, scale, and specific roles for government intervention that are necessarily to provide the fundamental legal and institutional framework that markets might need in order to function well.
What Is Market Efficiency?  

Market efficiency refers to the degree to which market prices reflect all available, relevant information. If markets are efficient, then all information is already incorporated into prices, and so there is no way to "beat" the market because there are no undervalued or overvalued securities available.



The term was taken from a paper written in 1970 by economist Eugene Fama, however Fama himself acknowledges that the term is a bit misleading because no one has a clear definition of how to perfectly define or precisely measure this thing called market efficiency. Despite such limitations, the term is used in referring to what Fama is best known for, the efficient market hypothesis (EMH).



The EMH states that an investor can't outperform the market, and that market anomalies should not exist because they will immediately be arbitraged away. Fama later won the Nobel Prize for his efforts. Investors who agree with this theory tend to buy index funds that track overall market performance and are proponents of passive portfolio management.





Key Takeaways

Market efficiency refers to how well current prices reflect all available, relevant information about the actual value of the underlying assets.A truly efficient market eliminates the possibility of beating the market, because any information available to any trader is already incorporated into the market price.As the quality and amount of information increases, the market becomes more efficient reducing opportunities for arbitrage and above market returns.



At its core, market efficiency is the ability of markets to incorporate information that provides the maximum amount of opportunities to purchasers and sellers of securities to effect transactions without increasing transaction costs. Whether or not markets such as the U.S. stock market are efficient, or to what degree, is a heated topic of debate among academics and practitioners.


   Market Efficiency Explained  

There are three degrees of market efficiency. The weak form of market efficiency is that past price movements are not useful for predicting future prices. If all available, relevant information is incorporated into current prices, then any information relevant information that can be gleaned from past prices is already incorporated into current prices. Therefore future price changes can only be the result of new information becoming available.



Based on this form of the hypothesis, such investing strategies such as momentum or any technical-analysis based rules used for trading or investing decisions should not be expected to persistently achieve above normal market returns. Within this form of the hypothesis there remains the possibility that excess returns might be possible using fundamental analysis. This point of view has been widely taught in academic finance studies for decades, though this point of view is no long held so dogmatically.



The semi-strong form of market efficiency assumes that stocks adjust quickly to absorb new public information so that an investor cannot benefit over and above the market by trading on that new information. This implies that neither technical analysis nor fundamental analysis would be reliable strategies to achieve superior returns, because any information gained through fundamental analysis will already be available and thus already incorporated into current prices. Only private information unavailable to the market at large will be useful to gain an advantage in trading, and only to those who possess the information before the rest of the market does.



The strong form of market efficiency says that market prices reflect all information both public and private, building on and incorporating the weak form and the semi-strong form. Given the assumption that stock prices reflect all information (public as well as private), no investor, including a corporate insider, would be able to profit above the average investor even if he were privy to new insider information.


   Differing Beliefs of an Efficient Market  

Investors and academics have a wide range of viewpoints on the actual efficiency of the market, as reflected in the strong, semi-strong, and weak versions of the EMH. Believers in strong form efficiency agree with Fama and often consist of passive index investors. Practitioners of the weak version of the EMH believe active trading can generate abnormal profits through arbitrage, while semi-strong believers fall somewhere in the middle.



For example, at the other end of the spectrum from Fama and his followers are the value investors, who believe stocks can become undervalued, or priced below what they are worth. Successful value investors make their money by purchasing stocks when they are undervalued and selling them when their price rises to meet or exceed their intrinsic worth.



People who do not believe in an efficient market point to the fact that active traders exist. If there are no opportunities to earn profits that beat the market, then there should be no incentive to become an active trader. Further, the fees charged by active managers are seen as proof the EMH is not correct because it stipulates that an efficient market has low transaction costs.


   An Example of an Efficient Market  

While there are investors who believe in both sides of the EMH, there is real-world proof that wider dissemination of financial information affects securities prices and makes a market more efficient.



For example, the passing of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, which required greater financial transparency for publicly traded companies, saw a decline in equity market volatility after a company released a quarterly report. It was found that financial statements were deemed to be more credible, thus making the information more reliable and generating more confidence in the stated price of a security. There are fewer surprises, so the reactions to earnings reports are smaller. This change in volatility pattern shows that the passing of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and its information requirements made the market more efficient. This can be considered a confirmation of the EMH in that increasing the quality and reliability of financial statements is a way of lowering transaction costs.



Other examples of efficiency arise when perceived market anomalies become widely known and then subsequently disappear. For instance, it was once the case that when a stock was added to an index such as the S&P 500 for the first time, there would be a large boost to that share's price simply because it became part of the index and not because of any new change in the company's fundamentals. This index effect anomaly became widely reported and known, and has since largely disappeared as a result. This means that as information increases, markets become more efficient and anomalies are reduced.
What Is Market Exposure?  

Market exposure refers to the dollar amount of funds or percentage of a broader portfolio that is invested in a particular type of security, market sector, or industry. Market exposure is usually expressed as a percentage of total portfolio holdings, for instance, as in 10% of a portfolio being exposed to the oil and gas sector or a $ 50,000 in Tesla stock.



Market exposure represents the amount an investor can lose from the risks unique to a particular investment or asset class. It is a tool used to measure and balance risk in an investment portfolio. Having too much exposure to a particular area can indicate a portfolio needs to undergo broader diversification.





Key Takeaways

Market exposure is the proportion of one's assets that are tied up in a class of securities, a particular industry, or a geographic market. Market exposure can be subdivided in various ways to gain insight into the risks posed to investors across different types of markets. Measuring and balancing market exposure across all assets in a diversified portfolio is a key aspect of managing total risk. 


   Understanding Market Exposure  

Market exposure describes the risk and reward potential for an investor given the division of assets within an investment portfolio. The proportion of assets invested in any given asset class, market segment, geographic region, industry, or stock can be used to measure the degree to which the investor is exposed to potential loss due to those specific assets. "



Market exposure can be separated based on a variety of factors that then allows an investor to mitigate the risks involved in certain investments by balancing exposure via diversification to other asset classes, regions, or industries. The greater one's market exposure, the greater their total market risk in that specific investment area. A concentration of market exposure in any one area can lead to large losses if that area happens to get hit hard.


  Market Exposure by Investment Type  

Investments can be segmented based on the type of asset class involved. For example, a portfolio can consist of 20% bonds and 80% stocks. The investor’s market exposure to stocks is thus 80%. This investor stands to lose or gain more depending on how stocks perform than from how bonds perform.


  Market Exposure by Region  

When examining the market exposure in a portfolio, an investor can also examine holdings by geographic location. This may include separating domestic investments from those of foreign economies, or further dividing foreign markets by their specific region in the world or as emerging markets.



For example, an investor could have a portfolio that is allocated to 50% domestic and 50% foreign stocks. If additional exposure separation is desired, the foreign holdings may be divided further to show 30% in Asian markets and 20% in European markets. Moreover, we can describe the Asian segment as allocated 50% to developed and emerging markets apiece.


  Market Exposure by Industry Segment  

Investments can also be divided up by the industry or economic sector within which the underlying companies operate.



Using the above hypothetical investor’s 80% market exposure to stocks, there might be a 30% market exposure to the health care sector, 25% exposure to the technology sector, 20% to the financial services sector, 15% to the defense sector, and 10% to the energy sector. The portfolio’s returns are more influenced by health care stocks than by energy stocks because of the greater market exposure to the former.


   Exposure, Diversification, and Risk Management  

The exposure of a portfolio to particular securities, markets, or sectors must be considered when determining a portfolio’s overall asset allocation since diversification can greatly increase returns while also minimizing losses. For instance, a portfolio with both stock and bond holdings that includes market exposure to both types of assets typically has less risk than a portfolio with exposure only to stocks. In other words, diversification in this way reduces market exposure risks.



This applies to allocating assets across different asset classes or industries. Using the aforementioned example, if the investor wanted to reduce high market exposure to health care because of major changes in the industry brought by new federal regulations, selling 50% of those holdings reduces that particular exposure to 15%.
What Is Market Failure?  

Market failure, in economics, is a situation defined by an inefficient distribution of goods and services in the free market. In an ideally functioning market, the forces of supply and demand balance each other out, with a change in one side of the equation leading to a change in price that maintains the market's equilibrium. In a market failure, however, something interferes with this balance.



When markets fail, the individual incentives for rational behavior do not lead to rational outcomes for the group. In other words, each individual makes the correct decision for themselves, but those prove to be the wrong decisions for the group as a whole.





Key Takeaways


Market failure refers to the inefficient allocation of resources that occurs when individuals acting in rational self-interest produce a less-than-optimal outcome.
Market failure can occur in explicit markets where goods and services are bought and sold outright, or in implicit markets such as elections or the legislative process.
It may be possible to correct market failures using private market solutions, government-imposed solutions, or voluntary collective actions.

   Understanding Market Failure  

A market failure refers to the inefficient distribution of resources that occurs when the individuals in a group end up worse off than if they had not acted in rational self-interest. In the case of a market failure, the overall group incurs too many costs or receives too few benefits. The economic outcomes under market failure deviate from what economists usually consider optimal and are usually not economically efficient.



Contrary to what the name implies, market failure does not describe imperfections just in the market economy—there can be market failures in government activity, too. One noteworthy example is rent seeking by special interest groups. Special interest groups can benefit by lobbying for small costs on everyone else, such as through a tariff. When each small group imposes its costs, the whole group is worse off than if no lobbying had taken place.



Not every bad outcome from market activity counts as a market failure. In addition, while correcting the imbalances underlying a market failure often requires government intervention, private-market actors may also be able to solve the problem. On the flip side, not all market failures have a potential solution, even with prudent regulation or extra public awareness.


   Causes of Market Failure  

There are many types of imbalances that can affect the equilibrium of the markets. The following list provides an overview of some common causes of market failure.



Externalities: Externalities occur when the consumption of a good or service benefits or harms a third party. Pollution resulting from the production of certain goods is an example of a negative externality that can hurt individuals and communities. The collateral damage caused by negative externalities may lead to market failure.
Information failure: When there is insufficient information available to certain participants in the market, this can also be the source of market failure. If the buyer or seller in a transaction lacks access to the information on which the price is based, they may be willing to overpay or undercharge for a good or service, disrupting the market's equilibrium.
Market control: When one party has too much control over a market, this can also create imbalanced pricing and lead to market failure. In the case of a monopoly or oligopoly, a single seller or a small group of sellers can manipulate pricing. In other situations, known as monopsony or oligopsony, it is the buyers that have the advantage. In either case, the disrupted balance of supply and demand could cause market failure.
Public goods: Public goods are another example of market failure because they defy the tenets of supply and demand that drive the free markets. Public goods and services are nonexcludable—once something like a street light is produced, it is accessible to everyone, and the producer cannot limit consumption only to paying customers. Public goods are also nonrival, as use by one individual does not limit consumption by others. Given these characteristics, the private sector has little incentive to produce public goods, which leads to market failure, and the government usually has to provide these goods or subsidize their production.


   Solutions to Market Failure  

There are many potential solutions for market failure. These can take the form of private market solutions, government-imposed solutions, or voluntary collective action solutions.



Private market solutions: In some instances, the solution to a market failure may emerge within the private market itself. For example, asymmetrical information could be solved by intermediaries or rating agencies such as Moody's and Standard & Poor's informing market participants about securities risk. Underwriters Laboratories LLC performs the same task for electronics. Negative externalities such as pollution may be solved with tort lawsuits that increase opportunity costs for the polluter. Radio broadcasts elegantly solved the non-excludable problem by packaging periodic paid advertisements with the free broadcast.
Government-imposed solutions: When the solution does not come from the market itself, governments can enact legislation and take other measures as a response to a market failure. For example, if businesses hire too few low-skilled workers after a minimum wage increase, the government can create exceptions for less-skilled workers. Governments can also impose taxes and subsidies as possible solutions. Subsidies can help encourage behavior that can result in positive externalities. Meanwhile, taxation can help cut down negative behavior. For example, placing a tax on tobacco can increase the cost of consumption, therefore making it more expensive for people to smoke.
Collective action solutions: While the government may have the upper hand in developing legislative, tax, or regulatory solutions, private collective action can also help solve the market failure. Parties can privately agree to limit consumption and enforce rules among themselves to overcome the market failure of the tragedy of the commons. Consumers and producers can band together to form co-ops to provide services that otherwise might be underprovided in a pure market, such as a utility co-op for electric service to rural homes or a co-operatively held refrigerated storage facility for a group of dairy farmers to chill their milk at an efficient scale.




What Are Common Types of Market Failures?
Types of market failures include negative externalities, monopolies, inefficiencies in production and allocation, incomplete information, and inequality.




How Can Market Failure Be Corrected?
The primary means by which market failure can be corrected is through government intervention. This requires the government to pass legislation such as antitrust policies and to incorporate various price mechanisms such as taxes and subsidies.




Is Poverty a Market Failure?
Poverty is considered to be a result of market failure. When a recession hits, the poverty rate increases because employees lose their jobs or lose working hours, which results in no income or less income. Inequality, which is a component of market failure, can eventually lead to poverty when wealth is not distributed equally throughout society. This can be remedied with government intervention, such as by taxing the wealthy more or incorporating subsidies for those below the poverty level.


   The Bottom Line  

Market failure refers to inefficient allocation of resources in the free market that occurs when individuals acting in rational self-interest generate less-than-optimal economic outcomes. These economic inefficiencies may occur in explicit markets where goods and services are exchanged, or in implicit markets such as the exchange of favors in the legislative process.



The causes underlying market failures include negative externalities, incomplete information, concentrated market power, inefficiencies in production and allocation, and inequality. Government intervention such as taxes and subsidies may be effective in solving market failures, while other solutions may emerge within the private market or through collective actions.
What Is a Market Index?  

A market index is a hypothetical portfolio of investment holdings that represents a segment of the financial market. The calculation of the index value comes from the prices of the underlying holdings. Some indexes have values based on market-cap weighting, revenue weighting, float weighting, and fundamental weighting. Weighting is a method of adjusting the individual impact of items in an index.



Investors follow different market indexes to gauge market movements. The three most popular stock indexes for tracking the performance of the U.S. market are the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA), S&P 500 Index, and Nasdaq Composite Index. In the bond market, Bloomberg is a leading provider of market indexes with the Bloomberg U.S. Aggregate Bond Index serving as one of the most popular proxies for U.S. bonds. Investors cannot invest directly in an index, so these portfolios are used broadly as benchmarks or for developing index funds.





Key Takeaways

Market indexes provide a broad representative portfolio of investment holdings.Methodologies for constructing individual indexes vary but nearly all calculations are based on weighted average mathematics.Indexes are used as benchmarks to gauge the movement and performance of market segments.Investors use indexes as a basis for portfolio or passive index investing.


   Understanding a Market Index  

A market index measures the value of a portfolio of holdings with specific market characteristics. Each index has its own methodology which is calculated and maintained by the index provider. Index methodologies will typically be weighted by either price or market cap.



A wide variety of investors use market indexes for following the financial markets and managing their investment portfolios. Indexes are deeply entrenched in the investment management business with funds using them as benchmarks for performance comparisons and managers using them as the basis for creating investable index funds.


   Types of Market Indexes  

Each individual index has its own method for calculating the index’s value. Weighted average mathematics is primarily the basis for index calculations as values are derived from a weighted average calculation of the value of the total portfolio.



As such, price-weighted indexes will be more greatly impacted by changes in holdings with the highest price, while market capitalization-weighted indexes will be most greatly impacted by changes in the largest stocks, and so on, depending on the weighting characteristics.


   Market Indexes as Benchmarks  

As a hypothetical portfolio of holdings, indexes act as benchmark comparisons for a variety of purposes across the financial markets. As mentioned, the Dow Jones, S&P 500, and Nasdaq Composite are three popular U.S. indexes.



These three indexes include the 30 largest stocks in the U.S. by market cap, the 500 largest stocks, and all of the stocks on the Nasdaq exchange, respectively. Since they include some of the most significant U.S. stocks, these benchmarks can be a good representation of the overall U.S. stock market.



Other indexes have more specific characteristics that create a more narrowly targeted market focus. For example, indexes can represent micro-sectors or maturity in the case of fixed income. Indexes can also be created to represent a geographic segment of the market such as those that track the emerging markets or stocks in the United Kingdom and Europe. The FTSE 100 is an example of such an index.



Investors may choose to build a portfolio with diversified exposure to several indexes or individual holdings from a variety of indexes. They may also use benchmark values and performance to follow investments by segment. Some investors will allocate their investment portfolios based on the returns or expected returns of certain segments. Further, a specific index may act as a benchmark for a portfolio or a mutual fund.






   Index Funds  

Institutional fund managers use benchmarks as a proxy for a fund’s individual performance. Each fund has a benchmark discussed in its prospectus and provided in its performance reporting, thus offering transparency to investors. Fund benchmarks can also be used to evaluate the compensation and performance of fund managers.





1884

The year the Dow Jones Railroad Average, a precursor to the Dow Jones Industrial Average, was published by Charles Dow. The average was composed of nine railway companies, a steamship company, and Western Union.



Institutional fund managers also use indexes as a basis for creating index funds. Individual investors cannot invest in an index without buying each of the individual holdings, which is generally too expensive from a trading perspective.



Therefore, index funds are offered as a low-cost way for investors to invest in a comprehensive index portfolio, gaining exposure to a specific market segment of their choosing. Index funds use an index replication strategy that buys and holds all of the constituents in an index. Some management and trading costs are still included in the fund’s expense ratio, but the costs are much lower than fees for an actively managed fund.


   Examples of Market Indexes  

Some of the market’s leading indexes include:



S&P 500
Dow Jones Industrial Average
Nasdaq Composite
S&P 100
Russell 1000
S&P MidCap 400
Russell Midcap
Russell 2000
S&P 600
U.S. Aggregate Bond Market
Global Aggregate Bond Market



Investors often choose to use index investing over individual stock holdings in a diversified portfolio. Investing in a portfolio of index funds can be a good way to optimize returns while balancing risk. For example, investors seeking to build a balanced portfolio of U.S. stocks and bonds could choose to invest 50% of their funds in an S&P 500 ETF and 50% in a U.S. Aggregate Bond Index ETF.



Investors may also choose to use market index funds to invest in emerging growth sectors. Some popular emerging growth indexes and corresponding exchange-traded funds (ETFs) include the following:



The iShares Global Clean Energy ETF (ICLN), which tracks the S&P Global Clean Energy Index
The Reality Shares Nasdaq NexGen Economy ETF (BLCN), which tracks the Reality Shares Nasdaq Blockchain Economy Index
The First Trust Nasdaq Artificial Intelligence and Robotics ETF (ROBT), which tracks the Nasdaq CTA Artificial Intelligence and Robotics Index




What Are the Major Stock Indexes?
In the United States, the three leading stock indexes are the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the S&P 500, and the Nasdaq Composite. For international markets, the Financial Times Stock Exchange 100 Index and the Nikkei 225 Index are popular proxies for the British and Japanese stock markets, respectively.




Why Are Indexes Useful to Investors?
Indexes provide investors with a simplified snapshot of a large market sector, without having to examine every single asset in that index. For example, it would be impractical for an ordinary investor to study hundreds of different stock prices in order to understand the changing fortunes of different technology companies; however, a sector-wide index like the NASDAQ-100 Technology Sector Index can show the average trend for the sector.




What Is the Most Widely Cited U.S. Stock Index?
The Dow Jones Industrial Average is the oldest U.S. stock index, as well as the most frequently cited one; however, the S&P 500 represents a larger cross-section of the economy.


   The Bottom Line  

Market indexes are hypothetical portfolios of investment holdings that investors use as an indicator of market movement. There are many different types of market indexes. Market indexes are also used to create index funds, allowing investors to buy a basket of securities rather than picking individual stocks.
What are Market Indicators?  

Market indicators are quantitative in nature and seek to interpret stock or financial index data in an attempt to forecast market moves. Market indicators are a subset of technical indicators and are typically comprised of formulas and ratios. They aid investors' investment/trading decisions.





Key Takeaways

Market indicators are quantitative in nature and seek to interpret stock or financial index data in an attempt to forecast market moves.Market indicators are a subset of technical indicators and are typically comprised of formulas and ratios.Popular market indicators include Market Breadth, Market Sentiment, Advance-Decline, and Moving Averages.


   Understanding Market Indicators  

Market indicators are similar to technical indicators in that both apply a statistical formula to a series of data points to draw a conclusion. The difference is that market indicators use data points from multiple securities rather than just a single security. Often times, market indicators are plotted on a separate chart rather than appearing above or below an index price chart.



Most stock market indicators are created by analyzing the number of companies that have reached new highs relative to the number that created new lows, known as market breadth, since it shows where the overall trend is headed.



The two most common types of market indicators are:



Market Breadth indicators compare the number of stocks moving in the same direction as a larger trend. For example, the Advance-Decline Line looks at the number of advancing stocks versus the number of declining stocks.
Market Sentiment indicators compare price and volume to determine whether investors are bullish or bearish on the overall market. For example, the Put Call Ratio looks at the number of put options versus call options during a given period.



Here's an example of the NASDAQ Advance-Decline Issues index:

   Popular Market Indicators  

There are hundreds of different market indicators covering various indexes in the United States and around the world, including the NYSE, NASDAQ, AMEX, TSX, TSX-V, and various options exchanges.



Some of the most popular market indicators include:



Advance-Decline Issues - The ratio of advancing to declining securities at any given point in time. Since the indexes are weighted by market capitalization, this is helpful in determining true sentiment rather than just looking at the performance of the largest companies in a given index. Examples: $NYAD and $NAAD.
New Highs-New Lows - The ratio of new highs to new lows at any given point in time. When there are many new highs, it's a sign that the market may be getting frothy, while many new lows suggest that a market may be bottoming out.
McClellan Oscillator - This oscillator uses a moving average of highs and lows to help smooth out market breadth and make it easier to interpret rather than looking at choppy charts showing the raw numbers. It ranges from +150 to -150.
Moving Averages - Many market indicators look at the percentage of stocks above or below key moving averages, such as the 50- and 200-day moving averages. Examples: $NYA50, $NYA200, $NAA50, and $NAA200.
What Is a Market Leader?  

A market leader is a company with the largest market share in an industry that can often use its dominance to affect the competitive landscape and direction the market takes. A market leader typically enjoys the largest market share or the largest percentage of total sales in a given market. It may surpass its competitors according to other metrics, too, including brand loyalty, perceived value, distribution coverage, image, price, promotional spending, and profit.



Such a company may be the first to develop a product or service, which would allow it to set the tone for messaging, define the ideal product characteristics, and to become considered by the market as the brand that consumers associate with the offering itself.





Key Takeaways

A market leader usually holds the largest market share in a particular industry.Market leaders may also be the first to develop certain products or services.Apple and Amazon are examples of market leaders.


   How Market Leadership Works  

A company can establish itself as the market leader by being the first to offer a product or service. The product or service must be novel enough to attract a consumer base, and then the company must keep on top of consumer preferences to maintain leadership. If a company enters a market as a competitor to the first mover(s), it can aggressively market its own version of the product with differentiated features. Competitors that seek market leadership status may invest heavily in market research and product development, and then use consumer information to develop attributes that improve an existing product.



Market leaders may be able to leverage economies of scale to control market prices. Consumers trust market leaders and will choose to minimize risk by purchasing from market leaders. Market leaders have a detailed awareness of the purchasing decision-makers in their customer base and leverage aggressive advertising to take advantage of that knowledge while strengthening their brand. Market leaders attract the highest-quality development partners and are most likely to be innovative in adopting the technologies and processes that will help them continue to outshine their competition.


   Examples of Market Leaders  

Maintaining a dominant market share requires a company to not only retain its existing customers by building brand loyalty but also attract new customers who may be unfamiliar with the product or service. The company may also attract the customers of competitors by figuring out the ideal combination of quality and price. In this modern age of the internet, it is easy to identify consumer-oriented market leaders, such as Apple, Google, and Amazon. In capital goods, Boeing and Caterpillar are two examples.



Market leaders have to be careful when it comes to how they use and obtain their market share. If a company becomes too dominant in the market, or if it seems to be abusing its position, it may become subject to anti-trust lawsuits. Microsoft once became a target of regulators, for example. Also, from an investor's perspective, a market leader may not necessarily be the most profitable. Despite having the most market share, it could be the case that the company's total expenses, including product R&D, manufacturing costs, marketing costs, etc., are too high to make the company the most profitable among its competitors.
What Is a Market Maker?  

The term market maker refers to a firm or individual who actively quotes two-sided markets in a particular security by providing bids and offers (known as asks) along with the market size of each. Market makers provide liquidity and depth to markets and profit from the difference in the bid-ask spread. They may also make trades for their own accounts, which are known as principal trades.





Key Takeaways

A market maker is an individual participant or member firm of an exchange that buys and sells securities for its own account.Market makers provide the market with liquidity and depth while profiting from the difference in the bid-ask spread.Brokerage houses are the most common types of market makers, providing purchase and sale solutions for investors.Market makers are compensated for the risk of holding assets because a security's value may decline between its purchase and sale to another buyer. While brokers compete against one another, specialists post bids and asks and ensure they are reported accurately.






   Understanding Market Makers  

Many market makers are often brokerage houses that provide trading services for investors in an effort to keep financial markets liquid. A market maker can also be an individual trader, who is commonly known as a local. The vast majority of market makers work on behalf of large institutions due to the size of securities needed to facilitate the volume of purchases and sales.



Each market maker displays buy and sell quotations for a guaranteed number of shares. Once the market maker receives an order from a buyer, they immediately sell off their position of shares from their own inventory. This allows them to complete the order.



A market maker must commit to continuously quoting prices at which it will buy (or bid for) and sell (or ask for) securities. Market makers must also quote the volume in which they're willing to trade along with the frequency of time they will quote at the best bid and best offer prices. Market makers must stick to these parameters at all times and during all market outlooks. When markets become erratic or volatile, market makers must remain disciplined in order to continue facilitating smooth transactions.






Making a market signals a willingness to buy and sell the securities of a certain set of companies to broker-dealer firms that are members of that exchange.


   How Market Makers Earn Profits  

Market makers are compensated for the risk of holding assets because they may see a decline in the value of a security after it has been purchased from a seller and before it's sold to a buyer.



Consequently, they commonly charge the aforementioned spread on each security they cover. For example, when an investor searches for a stock using an online brokerage firm, it might observe a bid price of $100 and an ask price of $100.05. This means the broker purchases the stock for $100, then sells it to prospective buyers for $100.05. Through high-volume trading, a small spread can add up to large daily profits.



Market makers must operate under a given exchange's bylaws, which are approved by a country's securities regulator, such as the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The rights and responsibilities of market makers vary by exchange and by the type of financial instrument they trade, such as equities or options.


   Market Makers vs. Designated Market Makers (DMMs)  

Many exchanges use a system of market makers, who compete to set the best bid or offer so they can win the business of incoming orders. But some entities, such as the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), have what's called a designated market maker (DMM) system instead.



Once referred to as specialist systems, DMMs are essentially lone market makers with a monopoly over the order flow in a particular security or securities. Because the NYSE is an auction market, bids and asks are competitively forwarded by investors.



Here's how it works: The specialist posts these bids and asks for the entire market to see and ensures they are reported in an accurate and timely manner. They also make sure that the best price is always maintained, that all marketable trades are executed, and that order is maintained on the floor.



The specialist must also set the opening price for the stock each morning, which can differ from the previous day's closing price based on after-hours news and events. The specialist determines the correct market price based on supply and demand.

   Market Makers by Exchange  

As noted above, market makers provide trading services for investors who participate in the securities market. Their activities produce and boost liquidity within the markets. You can find these entities all over the global market. We've highlighted some of the most popular ones in different parts of the world.


  NYSE and Nasdaq  

The NYSE and Nasdaq are the two main stock exchanges in the United States. Both are based in New York.



According to the NYSE, a lead market maker is an "ETP holder or firm that has registered" to trade securities with the exchange. Over at the Nasdaq, a market maker is a "member firm that buys and sells securities at prices it displays in NASDAQ for its own account (principal trades) and for customer accounts (agency trades)."



Some of the top names of market makers in New York include:



Credit SuisseDeutsche Bank Goldman SachsKCG AmericasTimber Hill 


  Frankfurt Stock Exchange (FRA)  

The Frankfurt Stock Exchange (FRA) is one of seven stock exchanges in Germany. It is also the largest in the country. The exchange, which is operated by Deutsche Börse AG, calls its market makers designated sponsors.



The following are some of the names of market makers on Xetra, which is the electronic trading platform of the exchange group:



BerenbergJPMorganMorgan StanleyOptiverUBS Europe


  London Stock Exchange Group  

London is home to one of the largest stock exchange groups in Europe. The London Stock Exchange (LSE) is part of the London Stock Exchange Group. This group also includes the family of FTSE Russell Indexes and the group's clearing services.



The following are some of the key market makers in his part of the world:



BNP ParibasGMP Securities EuropeLiberium CapitalMediobancaStandard Chartered


  Tokyo Exchange Group  

The Tokyo Exchange Group combined the Tokyo Stock Exchange and the Osaka Securities Exchange into one unit in 2013. In addition to infrastructure and data, the group provides "market users with reliable venues for trading listed securities and derivatives instruments."



According to JPX, the following are some of the key names among market makers:



ABN AMRO ClearingNissan SecuritiesNomura SecuritiesPhillip SecuritiesSociete Generale


  Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX)  

Toronto is considered to be Canada's financial capital, which is where the country's leading stock exchange is located. The Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX), which is the country's largest exchange, is owned by TMX Group.



The TSX lists the following among its market makers:



BMO Nesbitt BurnsIntegral Wealth SolutionsQuestradeScotia CapitalTD Securities






Market-making facilitates a smoother flow of financial markets by making it easier for investors and traders to buy and sell. Without market making, there may be insufficient transactions and fewer investment activities.


   Example of Market Maker  

Here's a hypothetical example to show how a market maker trades. Let's say there's a market maker in XYZ stock. They may provide a quote of $10.00 - $10.05 or 100x500. This means that they make a bid (they will buy) of $10.00 for 100 shares. They'll also offer (they will sell) 500 shares at $10.05. Other market participants may then buy (lift the offer) from the MM at $10.05 or sell to them (hit the bid) at $10.00.




Who Are Market Makers and What Do They Do?
A market maker participates in the securities market by providing trading services for investors and boosting liquidity in the market. They specifically provide bids and offers for a particular security in addition to its market size. Market makers typically work for large brokerage houses that profit off of the difference between the bid and ask spread.




How Do Market Makers Work?
A number of market makers operate and compete with each other within securities exchanges to attract the business of investors through setting the most competitive bid and ask offers. In some cases, exchanges like the NYSE use a specialist system where a specialist is the sole market maker who makes all the bids and asks that are visible to the market. A specialist process is conducted to ensure that all marketable trades are executed at a fair price in a timely manner.




How Do Market Makers Earn a Profit?
Market makers earn a profit through the spread between the securities bid and offer price. Because market makers bear the risk of covering a given security, which may drop in price, they are compensated for this risk of holding the assets. For example, consider an investor who sees that Apple stock has a bid price of $50 and an ask price of $50.10. What this means is that the market maker bought the Apple shares for $50 and is selling them for $50.10, earning a profit of $0.10.


   The Bottom Line  

The market is made up of a range of different entities that help keep things going. They include corporations, exchanges, traders and investors, and market makers. Each one of these serves a different purpose: Companies offer their shares on the market. Exchanges are where these transactions take place, And traders and investors are at one end of the transactions. Market makers, though, play a very important role in all of this. These entities provide bids and offers and inject much-needed liquidity into the markets as they do this.
What Is Manipulation?  

Market manipulation is conduct designed to deceive investors by controlling or artificially affecting the price of securities. Manipulation is illegal in most cases, but it can be difficult for regulators and other authorities to detect and prove.



Market manipulation may involve factually false statements as well, but it always seeks to influence prices in order to mislead other market participants.





Key Takeaways

Market manipulation aims to mislead other market participants.Manipulation is hard to detect and prove, but it's also harder to execute in the larger and more liquid markets.Two common types of stock manipulation are the pump-and-dump and the poop-and-scoop.Currency manipulation is a distinct political claim typically made in trade disputes between sovereign countries.


   Manipulation Methods  

Manipulation is more difficult for the more liquid, or widely traded securities. It is much easier to manipulate a penny stock with a tiny typical daily trading volume than the share price of a large-cap company with daily turnover valued in billions of dollars.



The pump-and-dump is a market manipulation often used to artificially inflate the price of a microcap stock before selling it. Less common is the inverse poop-and-scoop scheme, in which false derogatory statements are made about a stock in order to buy it on the cheap. There's also the short-and-distort variety, essentially a poop-and-scoop executed by short-sellers in order o profit.



While such schemes rely primarily on promotion or factual misstatements they are often supplemented by illegal trading tactics designed to deceive.



One common means is order spoofing, which involves the placing of numerous buy or sell orders designed to move the price of the stock, then canceling them once other traders have moved their own bids or asks accordingly. Order spoofing has tempted staff at large Wall Street firms alongside shady daytraders, and can take place in the bond and metals markets as well as in the stock market.


   Currency Manipulation  

Currency manipulation is an accusation often levied in trade or exchange rate disputes, notably by the U.S. against trading partners who are sometimes alleged to set the exchange rate of their currency against the U.S. dollar artificially low to boost exports. Governments and central banks can be accused of currency manipulation if they fix the exchange rate or seek to affect it less openly with market transactions from time to time.



Currency manipulation is a political term rather than a legal one because foreign exchange policies are set by sovereign countries. Currencies are fixed or allowed to float for a variety of internal and external motives, while currency manipulation claims are almost always the result of dissatisfaction with trade flows. As a result, whether a currency manipulation is taking place or not is often a subjective judgement.



The U.S. Treasury makes a semiannual report to Congress on the macroeconomic and foreign exchange policies of major U.S. trading partners in accordance with the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988. The report uses evaluation criteria spelled out in the Trade Facilitation and Trade Enforcement Act of 2015. The December 2021 report concluded no major U.S. trading partner manipulated its currency's exchange rate against the U.S. dollar to gain an unfair competitive advantage in international trade, while singling out Vietnam and Taiwan for additional scrutiny.






Currency manipulation is a political claim rather than an illegal market deception.


   Example of Currency Manipulation Claim  

On August 5, 2019, the People's Bank of China (PBOC) set the Chinese yuan’s daily reference rate above 7 yuan per dollar for the first time in over a decade, depreciating the Chinese currency against the dollar and making Chinese exports cheaper in dollar terms. The rate was set after the announcement by the Trump administration of new tariffs of 10% on $300 billion worth of Chinese imports, which went into effect Sept. 1, 2019.



The same day the yuan exchange rate topped 7 per dollar, the Trump administration labeled China a currency manipulator, a designation lifted a few months later. The tariffs on Chinese exports, however, remained in place as of January 2022.
What Is Market Neutral?  

A market-neutral strategy is a type of investment strategy undertaken by an investor or an investment manager that seeks to profit from both increasing and decreasing prices in one or more markets while attempting to completely avoid some specific form of market risk.



Market-neutral strategies are often attained by taking matching long and short positions in different stocks to increase the return from making good stock selections and decreasing the return from broad market movements.





Key Takeaways

Market neutral refers to a type of investment strategy employed by investment managers that seek to profit from both increasing and decreasing prices in the financial markets.Known as a market-neutral strategy, the investment selections seek to avoid significant losses, as the long and short positions serve as a hedge to one another.Market-neutral strategies are often employed by hedge funds as their investment objective is absolute returns rather than relative returns.The two main types of market-neutral strategies that fund managers employ are fundamental arbitrage and statistical arbitrage.Market-neutral strategies have one of the lowest positive correlations to the market because they place specific bets on stock price convergences while hedging away the general market risk.


   Understanding Market Neutral  

There is no single accepted method of employing a market-neutral strategy. Beyond the method mentioned above, market-neutral strategists may also use other tools such as merger arbitrage, shorting sectors, and so on.



Managers who hold a market-neutral position are able to exploit any momentum in the market. Hedge funds commonly take a market-neutral position because they are focused on absolute as opposed to relative returns. A market-neutral position may involve taking a 50% long and a 50% short position in a particular industry, such as oil and gas, or taking the same position in the broader market.



Often, market-neutral strategies are likened to long/short equity funds, though they are distinctly different. Long/short funds simply aim to vary their long and short stock exposures across industries, taking advantage of undervalued and overvalued opportunities.



Market-neutral strategies, on the other hand, focus on making concentrated bets based on pricing discrepancies with the main goal of achieving a zero beta versus its appropriate market index to hedge out systematic risk. While market-neutral funds use long and short positions, this fund category's goal is distinctly different from plain long/short funds.


   Types of Market-Neutral Strategies  

There are two main market-neutral strategies that fund managers employ: fundamental arbitrage and statistical arbitrage. Fundamental market-neutral investors use fundamental analysis, rather than quantitative algorithms, to project a company's path forward and to make trades based on predicted stock price convergences.



Statistical arbitrage market-neutral funds use algorithms and quantitative methods to uncover price discrepancies in stocks based on historical data. Then, based on these quantitative results, the managers will place trades on stocks that are likely to revert to their price means.



A great benefit and advantage of market-neutral funds is their big emphasis on constructing portfolios to mitigate market risk. In times of high market volatility, historical results have shown that market-neutral funds are likely to outperform funds using other certain strategies.



Except for pure short-selling strategies, market-neutral strategies historically have the lowest positive correlations to the market specifically because they place specific bets on stock price convergences while hedging away the general market risk.


   Example of a Market Neutral Fund  

Because it is a market-neutral strategy, the Vanguard Market Neutral Investor Shares Fund (VMNFX) uses long and short-selling strategies, unlike the firm's other mutual funds, which only buy and sell long positions. The fund's strategy aims to minimize the impact of the stock market on its returns, meaning the fund's returns may vary widely from those of the market.



Although most funds that short stocks, such as hedge funds, do not disclose their short holdings because SEC rules do not require them to, the Vanguard Market Neutral Investor Shares does publish its shorts.



It chooses short positions by evaluating companies in five categories: growth, quality, management decisions, sentiment, and valuation. Then, it creates a composite expected return for all of the stocks in its universe and shorts those with the lowest scores.



Investing in market-neutral specific funds is typically for high-net-worth individuals. For example, VMNFX has a minimum investment amount of $50,000. Other funds may have extremely high expense ratios, well above the investment ratios of passively managed funds.
What Is a Market-on-Close (MOC) Order?  

A market-on-close (MOC) order is a non-limit market order, which traders execute as near to the closing price as they can—either exactly at, or slightly after the market close. The purpose of a MOC order is to get the last available price of that trading day. MOC orders are not available in all markets or from all brokers.



All MOC orders must be received at New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) markets by 3:50 p.m. Eastern Time (ET), unless entered to offset a published imbalance. NYSE markets' rules also prohibit the cancellation or reduction in the size of any MOC order after 3:45 p.m. ET.



On the Nasdaq, all MOC orders must be received at Island by 3:55 p.m. ET, but may not be canceled or modified after 3:50 p.m. ET.





Key Takeaways

A market-on-close (MOC) order is a non-limit market order that is executed at or after the closing of a stock exchange.Traders generally would place a MOC order in anticipation of a stock's movement the next day.A surge of MOC orders can create trade imbalances at the end of the trading day.


   Understading Market-on-Close (MOC) Orders  

A market-on-close order is simply a market order that is scheduled to trade at the close, at the most recent trading price. The MOC order remains dormant until near the close, at which time it becomes active. Once the MOC order becomes active, it behaves like a normal market order. MOC orders can help investors to get into or out of the market at the closing price without having to place a market order immediately when the market closes.



Traders often place MOC orders as part of a trading strategy. For example, some traders will want to exit at the close by either buying or selling a given financial instrument if a certain price level was breached during the trading day. MOC orders do not specify a target price, but traders sometimes use MOC orders as a limit-order qualifier—which means that a limit order will be automatically canceled if it isn't executed during the trading day.



Using a MOC order in this way ensures that the desired transaction is executed, but it still would leave the investor exposed to end-of-day price movements.






Although placing a market-on-close (MOC) order can guarantee that your buy or sell order will occur at the close of trading, it does not guarantee the price.


   Benefits and Risks of MOC Orders  

There are a number of situations in which an investor might want to get the closing price of a security. If you suspect that a company's stock might move drastically overnight—as the result of a scheduled after-hours earnings call or an anticipated news story, for example—then placing a MOC order would ensure that your purchase or sale would take place before the news breaks the next day.



MOC orders can also be convenient when an investor knows that they're not going to be available to execute an essential transaction, like exiting a position, at the end of the day. Being able to place market-on-close orders is also useful if you want to trade on some foreign exchanges that are not in your time zone.



An obvious drawback of MOC orders is that, if you will not be present at the close of the market, then you really do not know at what price your order will be filled. In addition to risking end-of-day price fluctuations, MOC orders can also risk being poorly executed because of end-of-day trading clusters, though this is rare.


   Example of an MOC Order  

Suppose a trader owns 100 shares of company ABC, which is expected to report negative earnings after the closing bell. ABC's earnings have failed to surpass analysts' expectations for several quarters, but its stock price has not displayed adverse price movement during the day. In order to minimize losses from a selloff in ABC's shares after its earnings call, the trader places a MOC order to sell all or part of their shares in ABC.
What Is a Market Order?  

A market order is an instruction by an investor to a broker to buy or sell stock shares, bonds, or other assets at the best available price in the current financial market.



It is the default choice for buying and selling for most investors most of the time. If the asset is a large-cap stock or a popular exchange-traded fund (ETF), there will be plenty of willing buyers and sellers out there. That means that a market order will be completed nearly instantaneously at a price very close to the latest posted price that the investor can see.



A limit order, which instructs the broker to buy or sell only at a certain price, is the main alternative to the market order for most individual investors.






A market order is an instruction to buy or sell a security immediately at the current price.A limit order is an instruction to buy or sell only at a price specified by the investor.Market orders are best used for buying or selling large-cap stocks, futures, or ETFs.A limit order is preferable if buying or selling a thinly traded or highly volatile asset.The market order is the most common transaction type made in the stock markets. It is the default choice in most online broker transaction pages.


   Understanding Market Orders  

If you use an online broker, clicking on the "buy" or "sell" button generally calls up an order form that the user is required to fill in. It needs to know the stock symbol, whether you're buying or selling, and how many shares. It also asks for a price type.



The default price type is generally "market." That makes it a market order. The investor is not setting a price but is indicating a willingness to pay the current market price.



There are other options, including "market on close," which indicates that you want the transaction at the last possible moment in the session, and "limit," which allows you to buy only at or below a set price or sell only at or above a set price.



The market on close option is for people who think they'll get the best price of the day at the end of the day. The limit order allows you to walk away from your laptop confident that an opportunity won't be missed.






If you think a stock will hit a level you find acceptable soon, try a limit order. If you're wrong, the transaction won't take place.


  Why Use a Market Order  

A market order is the most common and straightforward transaction in the markets. It is meant to be executed as quickly as possible at the current asking price, and it is the choice of most stock buyers and sellers most of the time. That's why it's the default option.



The market order is usually the lowest-priced option as well. Some brokers charge more for transactions that involve limit orders.



The market order is a safe option for any large-cap stock, because they are highly liquid. That is, there's a huge number of their shares changing hands at any given moment during the trading day. The transaction goes through immediately. Unless the market is wildly unsettled at that moment, the price displayed when you click on "buy" or "sell" will be nearly identical to the price you get.


  Downside of a Market Order  

The market order is less reliable when trading less liquid investments, such as small-cap stocks in obscure or troubled companies. Because these stocks are thinly traded, the bid-ask spreads tend to be wide. As a result, market orders can get filled slowly and at disappointing prices.


   Market Order vs. Limit Order  

Market orders are the most basic buy and sell trades. Limit orders give greater control to the investor.



A limit order allows an investor to set a maximum acceptable purchase price amount or a minimum acceptable sales price while placing an order. The order will be processed only if the asset hits that price.



Limit orders are preferable in a number of circumstances:



If the shares trade lightly or are highly volatile in price. The investor can time the sale for the next price upswing (or, in the case of selling, downswing).If the investor has determined an acceptable price in advance. The limit order will be ready and waiting. (Note: If you use an online broker, don't check on the "good for day" option unless you want the order to vanish at the close of that trading session.)If the investor wants to be really certain that the price won't slip in the split-second it takes to finalize the transaction. A stock quote indicates the last price that was agreed upon by buyer and seller. The price may tick up or down with the next transaction.



Limit orders are commonly used by professional traders and day traders who may be making a profit by buying and selling huge quantities of shares very quickly in order to exploit tiny changes in their prices.






Transactions in big-cap stocks like Apple and Microsoft tend to be fulfilled nearly instantaneously and without issue. Smaller and more obscure stocks might not.


   Example of a Market Order  

Say the bid-ask prices for shares of Excellent Industries are $18.50 and $20, respectively, with 100 shares available at the ask. If a trader places a market order to buy 500 shares, the first 100 will execute at $20.



The following 400, however, will be filled at the best asking price for sellers of the next 400 shares. If the stock is very thinly traded, the next 400 shares might be executed at $22 or more.



This is why it’s a good idea to use limit orders for some transactions. Market orders are filled at a price dictated by the market. Limit orders give more control to the trader. as opposed to limit or stop orders, which provide traders with more control. A trade for a large number of shares can also be entered as a sweep-to-fill order that is broken into segments and executed at the best price.


   Special Considerations  

Any time a trader seeks to execute a market order, the trader is willing to buy at the asking price or sell at the bid price. Thus, the person conducting a market order is immediately giving up the bid-ask spread.



For this reason, it’s a good idea to look closely at the bid-ask spread before placing a market order—especially for thinly traded securities. Failure to do so can be costly. This is doubly important for people who trade frequently or use anyone utilizing an automated trading system.


   Market Order FAQs  

Here are the answers to some commonly asked questions about market orders.


  What does market order mean?  

A market order directs a broker to buy or sell shares of an asset at the prevailing market price. It is the most common way to buy or sell stocks for most investors most of the time.


  How does a market order work?  

A market order by definition is an instruction for immediate purchase or sale at the current price. It's a bit like buying a product without negotiating. However, in the financial markets, a fair price at any given moment is determined by the vast volume of sell and buy orders being resolved. You'll get the price that is fair at that moment.



Traders have the option of making it a limit order rather than a market order.


  What is the difference between a market order and a limit order?  

A limit order sets a specific maximum price at which the investor is willing to buy or a specific minimum price at which the investor will sell. The limit order will sit there until it is fulfilled or it expires.



In an online buy or sell order, the "good for day" option will cancel the order at the market close if the price is not met.


  What is a batch order vs. a market order?  

A batch order is a behind-the-scenes transaction conducted by brokerages. At the start of the trading day, they combine various orders for the same stocks and push them through as if they were a single transaction. Batch trading is permitted only at the opening of the market and only with orders placed between trading sessions.



Each batch order will consist of a number of market orders, sent through sometime between that day's session and the previous close.
What Is Market Orientation?  

Market orientation is an approach to business that prioritizes identifying the needs and desires of consumers and creating products and services that satisfy them. Companies that have a market orientation consider the opinions and needs of their target market as a critical component of their research and development (R&D) for new products.



It may sound obvious, but advocates of market orientation argue that the conventional approach to product development is the opposite. That is, marketing strategies focus on establishing key selling points to promote existing products rather than designing products that have the qualities consumers say they want.





Key Takeaways

Market orientation is a strategic focus on identifying consumer needs and desires in order to define new products to be developed.Established businesses like Amazon and Coca-Cola use market orientation principles to improve or expand their products or services.Even consumer demands that are impractical today can inform long-range decision-making.


   How Market Orientation Works  

Market orientation is a customer-centered approach to product design. It involves market research aimed at determining what consumers view as their immediate needs, primary concerns, or personal preferences within a particular product category.



Companies may also employ additional data analysis to reveal trends and consumer desires that are not specifically expressed. A knowledge of these trends ideally can help product developers meet or even anticipate consumer needs. They may even inspire improvements that the consumer was not aware of as being an option.



This allows a company to focus its product development efforts on the characteristics that are most in-demand. With an increasingly global economy and the proliferation of choices for consumers, companies that adapt to a market orientation may benefit from a competitive advantage over other companies.


   Advantages of Market Orientation  

Market orientation often includes improvements in customer service and product support geared to solving concerns raised by consumers. This helps ensure customer satisfaction remains high with the company as a whole and promotes brand loyalty and positive word-of-mouth advertising.



To be successful, companies need to ensure that all departments adopt and promote the market orientation approach so that it becomes an integral part of the corporate culture. When effective, market orientation can help a company increase customer retention and propel growth in new demographics.



At times, market orientation may reveal customer desires that are simply not cost-effective or practical to implement. The business then must determine how to meet customer expectations in the best way possible.



At the very least, impractical ideas may inform long-term development strategies. Options that are not cost effective today may become quite possible down the line due to changes in technology, science, regulation or other market conditions.


   Market Orientation vs. Other Strategies  

Development focused on market orientation puts consumers' desires first, creating the product around their expressed needs and wants. This contrasts with product orientation, a business philosophy that emphasizes getting the consumer to become aware of and like the features and benefits of a particular product.



Product differentiation often goes hand-in-hand with a product orientation approach. With this approach, the company employs an advertising strategy that aims at clearly identifying the attributes that distinguish a brand from its competitors.



Sales orientation focuses on persuading the consumer into immediate action through means such as online ads, social media, television commercials, in-store demonstrations, or direct response marketing.



Any or all of these approaches may be required for a successful marketing strategy, but most businesses focus on one or a few as their primary focus.


   Real World Examples of Market Orientation  
  Amazon  

Amazon is an example of a market-oriented company. As it has grown and developed, it has consistently added processes and features that clearly address concerns and desires expressed by consumers.



For example, many consumers, especially city dwellers, worry about getting packages delivered when they're not at home. The company responded with Amazon Locker, a network of self-service pickup boxes.



Delivery charges, no matter how reasonable, are a chief irritant to consumers, and a reason to buy locally instead of ordering online. Amazon Prime charges an annual fee for the free delivery of most of its products.


  Coca-Cola  

Coca-Cola is another company that is famous for its market orientation. Considerable research goes into identifying new flavors that consumers will actually like, such as wild strawberry and lime. But those new flavors won't help Coca-Cola address the increasing health consciousness of consumers. That's why the company acquired brands including Dasani, Honest Tea, Smartwater, Simply Orange, Minute Maid, and Vitaminwater.
What Is Market Penetration?  

Market penetration is a measure of how much a product or service is being used by customers compared to the total estimated market for that product or service. Market penetration can also be used in developing strategies employed to increase the market share of a particular product or service.





Key Takeaways

Market penetration is a measure of how much a product or service is being used by target customers compared to the total estimated market for that product or service.Market penetration also relates to the number of potential customers that have purchased a specific company’s product instead of a competitor’s product.Market development is the strategy or action steps needed to increase market share or penetration.Common market penetration strategies include lowering prices, acquiring competitors, targeting new markets, or introducing new products. Companies must be mindful of how market penetration into new areas can jeopardize current relationships with customers, dilute equity branding, and confuse consumers on the company's identity.












Investopedia / Jiaqi Zhou


   Understanding Market Penetration  

Market penetration can be used to determine the size of the potential market. If the total market is large, new entrants to the industry might be encouraged that they can gain market share or a percentage of the total number of potential customers in the industry.



For example, if there are 300 million people in a country and 65 million of them own cell phones, the market penetration of cell phones would be approximately 22%. In theory, there are still 235 million more potential customers for cell phones, or 78% of the population remains untapped. The penetration numbers might indicate the potential for growth for cell phone makers.



In other words, market penetration can be used to assess an industry as a whole to determine the potential for companies within the industry to gain market share or grow their revenue through sales. Revisiting our example, the global cell phone market penetration is often used to estimate whether cell phone producers can meet their earnings and revenue estimates. If the market is considered saturated, it means that existing companies have the vast majority of the market share—leaving little room for new sales growth.


  Market Penetration Rate  

A key component of market penetration is quantifying a company's market penetration. This is done by calculating a firm's market penetration rate (discussed below). A market penetration rate is simply a ratio that compares a company's performance against the total market.



The market penetration rate is especially important because it allows companies to compare where they are currently, where they have been, where they want to be, and how their competitors are performing. The market penetration rate allows a company to set a SMART goal that can be calculated and tracked over time.


   How to Calculate Market Penetration  

Market penetration can be quantified as a rate that describes what proportion of the market has been saturated by the company. To calculate market penetration, you must know the number of customers a company has secured in addition to the total market size.

TTMS


=


Total Target Market Size







\begin{aligned}&\text{Market Penetration Rate} = \frac {\text{Customers Number} }{ \text{TTMS} } \times 100 \\&\textbf{where:} \\&\text{TTMS} = \text{Total Target Market Size} \\\end{aligned}


​Market Penetration Rate=TTMSCustomers Number​×100where:TTMS=Total Target Market Size​



The number of customers will be each unique customer that the company has secured business with. Some may choose to only use repeat customers to analyze the stronger consumer base. Others may choose any customer that has transacted in a given time period (i.e. over the past five years).



The total market size may be difficult to define, especially if the company has a broad geographical area or sells goods online. The total market size is not necessarily the population of the area; instead, it is the total potential customers the company could have.



An alternative but similar way to calculate market penetration is to focus on dollars as opposed to people. Sometimes, industries may be quoted as having a certain value or sales potential; therefore, companies can compare what they've sold and compare it to this market potential.

​Market Penetration Rate=TTMSPTotal Sales Dollars​×100where:TTMSP=Total Target Market Sales Potential​



In this latter formula, a company may care less on the number of customers it has secured. This strategy may be important for companies that are striving to secure the largest customers or biggest market participants. Though they may receive a small market penetration rate when considering the number of people they serve, companies that transact with the largest customers may be in better shape when using the second formula.






Market penetration is often cited as a percentage representing the total share of target customers attracted.


   Market Penetration for Companies  

Market penetration is not only used on a global and industry-wide scale to measure the scope and for products and services, but also is used by companies to assess their product's market share.



As a metric, market penetration relates to the number of potential customers that have purchased a specific company’s product instead of a competitor’s product, or no product at all. Market penetration for companies is typically expressed as a percentage, meaning the company's product represents a certain percentage of the total market for those products.



To calculate market penetration, the current sales volume for the product or service is divided by the total sales volume of all similar products, including those sold by competitors. The result is multiplied by 100 to move the decimal and create a percentage.



If a company has a high market penetration for their the products, they're considered a market leader in that industry. Market leaders have a marketing advantage because they can reach more potential customers due to their well-established products and brand. For example, a market leader and manufacturer of cereal will have far more shelf space and better positioning than competitor brands because their products are so popular.



Also, market leaders can negotiate better terms with their suppliers because of their significant sales volume. As a result, market leaders can often produce a product cheaper than their competitors, given the scale of their operation.


   Market Penetration Strategies  

When a company tries to implement growth strategies, there are often four ways of doing so: developing new markets, diversifying into new products, penetrating existing markets, or developing new products. These four strategies are often depicted in an Ansoff Matrix.



Because the strategies that require new markets or new products are considered riskier, market penetration is often the lower risk option for growth. This is because the market has already been created and can be studied. In addition, the company may already be offering a product or a variation of the product. Using some of the techniques below, a company may experience growth through market penetration.


  Change Product Pricing  

More likely than not, a company won't be able to increase market share by increasing its price, Though Veblen goods do contradict the law of supply and demand, a company can more likely increase market penetration by lower its prices. This requires the company to sufficiently understand its input costs and profit margins. It also requires an understanding of its consumer base and whether a lower price will attract the audience the company intends to have long-term.


  Create New Product  

Though market penetration often occurs with existing products, a company may be able to solve a customer's problem in an innovative way with a new good. Though this riskier option does not guarantee market adoption, a company may invest in research and development to study existing products, analyze gaps in value, detect where existing products fall short of consumer expectations, and manufacture a new good.


  Target New Geographies  

With the proliferation of online sales, many businesses may already have access to wider markets than they realize. However, for service companies may be restricted to one geographic region, the company may employ the market penetration strategy of moving, developing, and expanding to a new area. Without having to leave its original location, the company may be able to fund operations in a new site by leveraging success at an existing site.


  Seek Partnerships  

Instead of seeking new places to operate, companies may penetrate new markets by seeking new people to work with. Consider the Barnes & Noble and Starbucks partnership. By agreeing to share in the success of internally-operated cafes within bookstores, Starbucks was able to enter into a different market it otherwise would not have had access to.






In the example above, it would have been critical for Starbucks to consider how its brand image integrated with Barnes & Noble. Without careful consideration, customers may have been confused to see it within other types of stores (i.e. consider a Starbucks inside of a Home Depot).


  Innovate Existing Product  

Though one strategy above entailed creating a new product, sometimes companies simply need to revamp an existing good. This is clearly evident with the frequent releases of updated smartwatches, cellphones, gaming consoles, or other technological devices. With each iteration, a company can simply improve and offer new benefits. Plus, existing customers that have already experienced the old devices may be further inclined to upgrade after a positive experience.


  Acquire Other Companies  

Though partnerships entail two separate entities temporarily coming together to share in the success, acquisitions result in two separate entities legally joining together. By acquiring a company, the acquirer may instantly have access to new products, markets, labor skillsets, intangible assets like goodwill, or research & development.


  Create Promotional Opportunities  

For companies that do not want to permanently discount their prices, companies can penetrate markets by offering temporary promotional opportunities. This strategy lures consumers in by attracting them to low prices. Be advised that though this may result in short-term success, it is more likely to lead to the incorrect audience having been attracted, especially if a company strives to be a higher-quality (and therefore higher price) company.


  Invest (More) in Sales Representatives  

Companies may have everything they need to successfully bring a product to market. However, if they do not have the appropriate staff on hand, their product may falter. No matter how strong a manufactured product is, a company must be able to bring it to the market, communicate its value, and close sales. This may require a company to increase the headcount of sales reps or invest more heavily in stronger talent.


   Advantages and Disadvantages of Market Penetration  
  Pros of Market Penetration  

For most companies, increasing their market penetration will increase sales. That's because market penetration strategies often entail increasing the number of customers served or more deeply becoming engrained in the larger customers they serve.



Companies may also experience other benefits from market penetration. Market penetration leads to higher visibility of products or services, and markets may begin to better recognize the benefits a company may be able to offer. This allows a company's brand equity to increase, as public perception of a company is most often improved as the company penetrates new markets.



Companies can also leverage successful market penetration by being more strategic with what they offer customers. Instead of being a price taker, companies that have a deeper presence in a market are more likely to be able to set their own price, sale terms, or enhance their products as they see fit. In many ways, market penetration can only occur through product differentiation and being able to convey unique benefits to consumers.


  Cons of Market Penetration  

Though market penetration may improve operations, it also has the risk to backfire. When companies seek out new markets or offer new products, it always runs the risk of diminishing their existing image, creating wrong public perceptions about their company, or attracting a client base that does not align with their strategic plan. As products become less popular, companies may be forced to liquidate products by selling them at a discount if they no longer resonate with consumers in markets they penetrated.



Though companies often perform market segmentation to attempt to attract the right customers, market penetration may increase the risk of the wrong customers being served. This can be detrimental to a marketing plan that strives to cater to a certain customer willing to pay certain prices for a certain quality of goods. Should Apple accidentally attract consumers who want to pay the lowest prices in the market, it will face a dilemma in trying to retain those customers or shifting its marketing plan.



Market penetration may also sound like a single instance of garnering deeper market presence, but it is actually a company-wide strategy that requires everyone to be on the same page about. Consider how the manufacturing, warehousing, procurement, or selling departments may not be aligned. This puts undue pressure on some departments that may need to play catch-up as markets are penetrated.




Market Penetration

Pros

Often leads to greater financial success through increased sales
Often leads to greater financial success through greater quantities of customers
Improves product visibility as more consumers are exposed to a company's goods
Improves a company's brand equity if the goods are appropriately received by the market



Cons

May cause confusion about how one product relates to another
May cause the company-wide image to falter if the wrong type of consumer is attracted
May force a shift in marketing strategy if a different audience is attracted
Requires all departments to be aligned; otherwise, undue pressure will cause certain departments to struggle





   Example of Market Penetration  

By the fourth quarter of 2017, Apple Inc. (AAPL) had amassed a market share of more than 50% of the smartphone market throughout the world. Apple has consistently introduced new versions or their iPhones with added enhancements and upgrades, including releasing its high-end iPhone X. As a result of its market penetration, Apple has a larger market share than all of its competitors combined.



However, the company still has opportunities to add to its customer base by targeting its competitors' clients and woo them over to Apple products and services.




Why Use Market Penetration Strategies?
Market penetration strategies are used to ultimately increase the number of customers and sales dollars of a company. Market penetration is the act of gaining a deeper presence in a market; by employing strategies to increase how deep a company is engrained in a market, that company often has greater short-term and long-term financial health, is better in tune with what its customers want, and is often better positioned compared to its competition.




What Is the Difference Between Market Penetration and Market Share?
Though both terms are used interchangeably, market penetration and market share are different. Market penetration is often used to describe just the percentage of target audience a company sells to, while market share takes a more holistic approach and looks at the percentage of the total addressable market a company sells to.




Does Market Penetration Increase Market Share?
Because market penetration is a more specific measurement of how much of a given market a company sells to, increasing market penetration often increases market share potential. For example, consider Apple moving into the smartwatch industry. Not only does this increase its market penetration potential, it is now part of an entirely new market and could potentially land parts of this new market share.


   The Bottom Line  

Market penetration is a measurement of how much of a product is used compared to a company's target audience. There's a number of strategies a company can use to increase its market penetration including change its pricing, marketing, manufacturing, or operating strategies. A company must be mindful to be stay true to its target audience and broadly communicate penetration strategies across the company.
What is a Market Portfolio?  

A market portfolio is a theoretical bundle of investments that includes every type of asset available in the investment universe, with each asset weighted in proportion to its total presence in the market. The expected return of a market portfolio is identical to the expected return of the market as a whole.


   The Basics of Market Portfolio  

A market portfolio, by nature of being completely diversified, is subject only to systematic risk, or risk that affects the market as a whole, and not to unsystematic risk, which is the risk inherent to a particular asset class.



As a simple example of a theoretical market portfolio, assume three companies exist in the stock market: Company A, Company B, and Company C. The market capitalization of Company A is $2 billion, the market capitalization of Company B is $5 billion, and the market capitalization of Company C is $13 billion. Thus, the total market capitalization comes to $20 billion. The market portfolio consists of each of these companies, which are weighed in the portfolio as follows:



Company A portfolio weight = $2 billion / $20 billion = 10%



Company B portfolio weight = $5 billion / $20 billion = 25%



Company C portfolio weight = $13 billion / $20 billion = 65%





key takeaways

A market portfolio is a theoretical, diversified group of every type of investment in the world, with each asset weighted in proportion to its total presence in the market.Market portfolios are a key part of the capital asset pricing model, a commonly used foundation for choosing which investments to add to a diversified portfolio.Roll's Critique is an economic theory that suggests that it is impossible to create a truly diversified market portfolio—and that the concept is a purely theoretical one.


   The Market Portfolio in the Capital Asset Pricing Model  

The market portfolio is an essential component of the capital asset pricing model (CAPM). Widely used for pricing assets, especially equities, the CAPM shows what an asset's expected return should be based on its amount of systematic risk. The relationship between these two items is expressed in an equation called the security market line. The equation for the security market line is:

For example, if the risk-free rate is 3%, the expected return of the market portfolio is 10%, and the beta of the asset with respect to the market portfolio is 1.2, the expected return of the asset is:



Expected return = 3% + 1.2 x (10% - 3%) = 3% + 8.4% = 11.4%


   Limitations of a Market Portfolio  

Economist Richard Roll suggested in a 1977 paper that it is impossible to create a truly diversified market portfolio in practice—because this portfolio would need to contain a portion of every asset in the world, including collectibles, commodities, and basically any item that has marketable value. This argument, known as "Roll's Critique," suggests that even a broad-based market portfolio can only be an index at best and as such only approximate full diversification.


   Real World Example of a Market Portfolio  

In a 2017 study, "Historical Returns of the Market Portfolio," the economists Ronald Q. Doeswijk, Trevin Lam, and Laurens Swinkels attempted to document how a global multi-asset portfolio has performed over the period 1960 to 2017. They found that real compounded returns varied from 2.87% to 4.93%, depending on the currency used. In U.S. dollars, the return was 4.45%.
What Is Market Power?  

Market power refers to a company's relative ability to manipulate the price of an item in the marketplace by manipulating the level of supply, demand or both.



A company with substantial market power has the ability to manipulate the market price and thereby control its profit margin, and possibly the ability to increase obstacles to potential new entrants into the market. Firms that have market power are often described as "price makers" because they can establish or adjust the marketplace price of an item without relinquishing market share.



Market power is also known as pricing power.






In a market where many producers exist that compete with each other to sell a similar product, such as wheat or oil, producers have very limited market power.





Key Takeaways

Market power refers to a company's relative ability to manipulate the price of an item in the marketplace by manipulating the level of supply, demand or both. In markets with perfect or near-perfect competition, producers have little pricing power and so must be price-takers.In monopolistic or oligopolistic markets, producers have far more market power.


   Understanding Market Power  

Market power can be understood as the level of influence that a company has on determining market price, either for a specific product or generally within its industry. An example of market power is Apple Inc. in the smartphone market. Although Apple cannot completely control the market, its iPhone product has a substantial amount of market share and customer loyalty, so it has the ability to affect overall pricing in the smartphone market.



The ideal marketplace condition is what is referred to as a state of perfect competition, in which there are numerous companies producing competing products, and no company has any significant level of market power. In markets with perfect or near-perfect competition, producers have little pricing power and so must be price-takers.



Of course, that is merely a theoretical ideal that rarely exists in actual practice. Many countries have antitrust laws or similar legislation designed to limit the market power of any one company. Market power is often a consideration in government approval of mergers. A merger is unlikely to be approved if it is believed that the resulting company would constitute a monopoly or would become a company with inordinate market power.



The scarcity of a resource or raw material can play a significant role in pricing power, even more so than the presence of rival providers of a product. For example, various threats, such as disasters that put the oil supply at risk, lead to higher prices from petroleum companies, despite the fact that rival providers exist and compete in the market. The narrow availability of oil, combined with the widespread reliance on the resource across multiple industries means that oil companies retain significant pricing power over this commodity.


   An Example of Market Power  

For example, when the iPhone was initially introduced by Apple, the company had substantial market power as it essentially defined the smartphone and app market with the launch of the product—it was for a short period of time the monopoly.



At the time, the cost to procure an iPhone was high and could remain so because of a lack of rival devices. Thus, iPhone prices were set initially by Apple and not by the marketplace. Even as the first competitor smartphones emerged, the iPhone continued to represent the high end of the market in terms of pricing and expected quality. As the rest of the industry began to catch up in service, quality, and availability of apps, Apple’s market power diminished.



The iPhone did not vanish from the market as more entrants arrived. Apple began to offer new models of iPhones in multiple variations, including less-expensive models targeted at more budget-minded consumers.






Monopsonies, markets where one buyer has all the market power, was theorized in the 1933 book "The Economics of Imperfect Competition" by Joan Robinson.


   Power Structures of Markets  

There are three basic marketplace conditions that exist in terms of market power, as applied to either an overall economy or a marketplace for a specific item.



The first is the previously noted ideal condition of perfect competition. With perfect competition, in addition to a number of companies producing the same or a similar product, there are also minimal or no barriers to new companies entering the marketplace. Agricultural markets are often pointed to as examples of relatively perfect competition markets since it is nearly impossible for anyone producer of an agricultural commodity to gain a substantial amount of market power.



The opposite of perfect competition conditions is a monopoly in which one company completely controls the market for a product or service, or at least a portion of the total market, and is able to adjust pricing at will. Limited monopolies are often allowed for utility companies, but their ability to raise prices is usually limited by government authority.



An oligopoly refers to a marketplace dominated by a small number of companies, and in which there are substantial barriers to new entrants in the market. The companies in an oligopoly generally have combined, but not an individual, market power. An example of oligopoly is the market for cellphone service, controlled by a relatively small number of firms, in which large barriers to new entrants exist.
What Is Market Price?  

The market price is the current price at which an asset or service can be bought or sold. The market price of an asset or service is determined by the forces of supply and demand. The price at which quantity supplied equals quantity demanded is the market price.



The market price is used to calculate consumer and economic surplus. Consumer surplus refers to the difference between the highest price a consumer is willing to pay for a good and the actual price they do pay for the good, or the market price. Economic surplus refers to two related quantities: consumer surplus and producer surplus. Producer surplus may also be referred to as profit: it is the amount that producers benefit by selling at the market price (provided that the market price is higher than the least that they would be willing to sell for). Economic surplus is the sum total of consumer surplus and producer surplus.





Key Takeaways

The market price is the current price at which a good or service can be purchased or sold.The market price of an asset or service is determined by the forces of supply and demand; the price at which quantity supplied equals quantity demanded is the market price. In financial markets, the market price can change quickly as people change their bid or offer prices, or as sellers hit the bid or buyers hit the offer.


   Understanding Market Price  

Shocks to either the supply or the demand for a good or service can cause the market price for a good or service to change. A supply shock is an unexpected event that suddenly changes the supply of a good or service. A demand shock is a sudden event that increases or decreases the demand for a good or service. Some examples of supply shock are interest rate cuts, tax cuts, government stimulus, terrorist attacks, natural disasters, and stock market crashes. Some examples of demand shock include a steep rise in oil and gas prices or other commodities, political turmoil, natural disasters, and breakthroughs in production technology.



In regards to securities trading, the market price is the most recent price at which a security was traded. The market price is the result of the interaction of traders, investors, and dealers in the stock market. In order for a trade to occur, there must be a buyer and a seller that meet at the same price. Bids are represented by buyers, and offers are represented by sellers. The bid is the higher price someone is advertising they will buy at, while the offer is the lowest price someone is advertising they will sell at. For a stock, this may be $50.51 and $50.52.



If the buyers no longer think that is a good price, they may drop their bid to $50.25. The sellers may agree or they may not. Someone may drop their offer to a lower price, or it may stay where it is. A trade only occurs if a seller interacts with the bid price, or a buyer interacts with the offer price. Bids and offers are constantly changing as the buyers and sellers change their minds about which price to buy or sell at. Also, as sellers sell to the bids, the price will drop, or as buyers buy from the offer, the price will rise.



The market price in the bond market is the last reported price excluding accrued interest; this is called the clean price. 


   Example of Market Price  

For example, assume that Bank of America Corp (BAC) has a $30 bid and a $30.01 offer. There are nine traders wanting to buy BAC stock; at this given time, this represents the demand for BAC stock. Five traders bid for 100 shares each at $30, three traders bid at $29.99, and one trader bids at $29.98. These orders are listed on the bid.



There are also nine traders wanting to sell BAC stock; at this given time, this represents the supply of BAC stock. Five traders sell 100 shares each at $30.01, three traders sell at $30.02, and one trader sells at $30.03. These orders are listed on offer.



Say a new trader comes in and wants to buy 800 shares at the market price. The market price, in this case, is all the prices and shares it will take to fill the order. This trader has to buy at the offer: 500 shares at $30.01, and 300 at $30.02. Now the spread widens, and the price is $30 by $30.03 because all the share offered at $30.01 and $30.02 have been bought. Since $30.02 was the last traded price, this is the market price.



Other traders may take action to close the spread. Since there are more buyers, the spread is closed by the bid adjusting upward. The result is a new price of $30.02 by $30.03, for example. This interaction is continually taking place in both directions, and is constantly adjusting the price.
What Is Market Research?  

The term market research refers to the process of evaluating the viability of a new service or product through research conducted directly with potential customers. It allows a company to define its target market and get opinions and other feedback from consumers about their interest in a product or service.



Research may be conducted in-house or by a third party that specializes in market research. It can be done through surveys and focus groups, among other ways. Test subjects are usually compensated with product samples or a small stipend for their time.





Key Takeaways

Companies conduct market research before introducing new products to determine their appeal to potential customers.Tools include focus groups, telephone interviews, and questionnaires.The results of market research inform the final design of the product and determine how it will be positioned in the marketplace.Market research usually combines primary information, gathered directly from consumers, and secondary information, which is data available from external sources.







Market Research 


   How Market Research Works  

Market research is used to determine the viability of a new product or service. The results may be used to revise the product design and fine-tune the strategy for introducing it to the public. This can include information gathered for the purpose of determining market segmentation. It also informs product differentiation, which is used to tailor advertising.



A business engages in various tasks to complete the market research process. It gathers information based on the market sector being targeted by the product. This information is then analyzed and relevant data points are interpreted to draw conclusions about how the product may be optimally designed and marketed to the market segment for which it is intended.



It is a critical component in the research and development (R&D) phase of a new product or service introduction. Market research can be conducted in a number of different ways, including surveys, product testing, interviews, and focus groups






Market research is a critical tool that companies use to understand what consumers want, develop products that those consumers will use, and maintain a competitive advantage over other companies in their industry.


   Primary Market Research vs. Secondary Market Research  

Market research usually consists of a combination of:



Primary research, gathered by the company or by an outside company that it hiresSecondary research, which draws on external sources of data


  Primary Market Research  

Primary research generally falls into two categories: exploratory and specific research.



Exploratory research is less structured and functions via open-ended questions. The questions may be posed in a focus group setting, telephone interviews, or questionnaires. It results in questions or issues that the company needs to address about a product that it has under development.Specific research delves more deeply into the problems or issues identified in exploratory research.


  Secondary Market Research  

All market research is informed by the findings of other researchers about the needs and wants of consumers. Today, much of this research can be found online.



Secondary research can include population information from government census data, trade association research reports, polling results, and research from other businesses operating in the same market sector.


   History of Market Research  

Formal market research began in Germany during the 1920s. In the United States, it soon took off with the advent of the Golden Age of Radio.



Companies that created advertisements for this new entertainment medium began to look at the demographics of the audiences who listened to each of the radio plays, music programs, and comedy skits that were presented.



They had once tried to reach the widest possible audience by placing their messages on billboards or in the most popular magazines. With radio programming, they had the chance to target rural or urban consumers, teenagers or families, and judge the results by the sales numbers that followed.


   Types of Market Research  
  Face-to-Face Interviews  

From their earliest days, market research companies would interview people on the street about the newspapers and magazines that they read regularly and ask whether they recalled any of the ads or brands that were published in them. Data collected from these interviews were compared to the circulation of the publication to determine the effectiveness of those ads.



Market research and surveys were adapted from these early techniques.






To get a strong understanding of your market, it’s essential to understand demand, market size, economic indicators, location, market saturation, and pricing.


  Focus Groups  

A focus group is a small number of representative consumers chosen to try a product or watch an advertisement.



Afterward, the group is asked for feedback on their perceptions of the product, the company’s brand, or competing products. The company then takes that information and makes decisions about what to do with the product or service, whether that's releasing it, making changes, or abandoning it altogether.


  Phone Research  

The man-on-the-street interview technique soon gave way to the telephone interview. A telephone interviewer could collect information in a more efficient and cost-effective fashion.



Telephone research was a preferred tactic of market researchers for many years. It has become much more difficult in recent years as landline phone service dwindles and is replaced by less accessible mobile phones.


  Survey Research  

As an alternative to focus groups, surveys represent a cost-effective way to determine consumer attitudes without having to interview anyone in person. Consumers are sent surveys in the mail, usually with a coupon or voucher to incentivize participation. These surveys help determine how consumers feel about the product, brand, and price point.


  Online Market Research  

With people spending more time online, market research activities have shifted online as well. Data collection still uses a survey-style form. But instead of companies actively seeking participants by finding them on the street or cold calling them on the phone, people can choose to sign up and take surveys and offer opinions when they have time.



This makes the process far less intrusive and less rushed, since people can participate on their own time and of their own volition.


   How to Conduct Market Research  

The first step to effective market research is to determine the goals of the study. Each study should seek to answer a clear, well-defined problem. For example, a company might seek to identify consumer preferences, brand recognition, or the comparative effectiveness of different types of ad campaigns.



After that, the next step is to determine who will be included in the research. Market research is an expensive process, and a company cannot waste resources collecting unnecessary data. The firm should decide in advance which types of consumers will be included in the research, and how the data will be collected. They should also account for the probability of statistical errors or sampling bias.



The next step is to collect the data and analyze the results. If the two previous steps have been completed accurately, this should be straightforward. The researchers will collect the results of their study, keeping track of the ages, gender, and other relevant data of each respondent. This is then analyzed in a marketing report that explains the results of their research.



The last step is for company executives to use their market research to make business decisions. Depending on the results of their research, they may choose to target a different group of consumers, or they may change their price point or some product features.



The results of these changes may eventually be measured in further market research, and the process will begin all over again.


   Benefits of Market Research  

Market research is essential for developing brand loyalty and customer satisfaction. Since it is unlikely for a product to appeal equally to every consumer, a strong market research program can help identify the key demographics and market segments that are most likely to use a given product.



Market research is also important for developing a company’s advertising efforts. For example, if a company’s market research determines that its consumers are more likely to use Facebook than X (formerly Twitter), it can then target its advertisements to one platform instead of another. Or, if they determine that their target market is value-sensitive rather than price-sensitive, they can work on improving the product rather than reducing their prices.






Market research only works when subjects are honest and open to participating.


   Example of Market Research  

Many companies use market research to test new products or get information from consumers about what kinds of products or services they need and don’t currently have.



For example, a company that’s considering starting a business might conduct market research to test the viability of its product or service. If the market research confirms consumer interest, the business can proceed confidently with its business plan. If not, the company can use the results of the market research to make adjustments to the product to bring it in line with customer desires.




What Are the Main Types of Market Research?
The main types of market research are primary research and secondary research. Primary research includes focus groups, polls, and surveys. Secondary research includes academic articles, infographics, and white papers.Qualitative research gives insights into how customers feel and think. Quantitative research uses data and statistics such as website views, social media engagement, and subscriber numbers.




What Is Online Market Research?
Online market research uses the same strategies and techniques as traditional primary and secondary market research, but it is conducted on the internet. Potential customers may be asked to participate in a survey or give feedback on a product. The responses may help the researchers create a profile of the likely customer for a new product.




What Are Paid Market Research Surveys?
Paid market research involves rewarding individuals who agree to participate in a study. They may be offered a small payment for their time or a discount coupon in return for filling out a questionnaire or participating in a focus group.




What Is a Market Study?
A market study is an analysis of consumer demand for a product or service. It looks at all of the factors that influence demand for a product or service. These include the product’s price, location, competition, and substitutes as well as general economic factors that could influence the new product’s adoption, for better or worse.


   The Bottom Line  

Market research is a key component of a company’s research and development (R&D) stage. It helps companies understand in advance the viability of a new product that they have in development and to see how it might perform in the real world.
What Is Market Risk?  

Market risk is the possibility that an individual or other entity will experience losses due to factors that affect the overall performance of investments in the financial markets.





Key Takeaways

Market risk, or systematic risk, affects the performance of the entire market simultaneously.Market risk cannot be eliminated through diversification.Specific risk, or unsystematic risk, involves the performance of a particular security and can be mitigated through diversification. Market risk may arise due to changes to interest rates, exchange rates, geopolitical events, or recessions.

   Understanding Market Risk  

Market risk and specific risk (unsystematic) make up the two major categories of investment risk. Market risk, also called systematic risk, cannot be eliminated through diversification, though it can be hedged in other ways. Sources of market risk include recessions, political turmoil, changes in interest rates, natural disasters, and terrorist attacks. Systematic risk, or market risk, tends to influence the entire market at the same time.



This can be contrasted with unsystematic risk, which is unique to a specific company or industry. Also known as nonsystematic risk, specific risk, diversifiable risk, or residual risk, in the context of an investment portfolio, unsystematic risk can be reduced through diversification.



Market risk exists because of price changes. The standard deviation of changes in the prices of stocks, currencies, or commodities is referred to as price volatility. Volatility is rated in annualized terms and may be expressed as an absolute number, such as $10, or a percentage of the initial value, such as 10%.






Publicly traded companies in the United States are required by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to disclose how their productivity and results may be linked to the performance of the financial markets. This requirement is meant to detail a company’s exposure to financial risk. For example, a company providing derivative investments or foreign exchange futures may be more exposed to financial risk than companies that do not provide these types of investments. This information helps investors and traders make decisions based on their own risk management rules.


   Other Types of Risk  

In contrast to the market’s overall risk, specific risk or unsystematic risk is tied directly to the performance of a particular security and can be protected against through investment diversification. One example of unsystematic risk is a company declaring bankruptcy, thereby making its stock worthless to investors.



The most common types of market risks include interest rate risk, equity risk, currency risk, and commodity risk.



Interest rate risk covers the volatility that may accompany interest rate fluctuations due to fundamental factors, such as central bank announcements related to changes in monetary policy. This risk is most relevant to investments in fixed-income securities, such as bonds. 
Equity risk is the risk involved in the changing prices of stock investments.
Commodity risk covers the changing prices of commodities such as crude oil and corn.
Currency risk, or exchange-rate risk, arises from the change in the price of one currency in relation to another. Investors or firms holding assets in another country are subject to currency risk.


   Managing Market Risk  

If you are investing, there is no single way to completely avoid market risk. But you can use hedging strategies to protect against volatility and minimize the impact that market risk will have on your investments and overall financial health. For example, you can buy put options to protect against a downside move when targeting specific securities. Or, if you want to hedge a large portfolio of stocks, you can utilize index options.



Use a variety of these strategies to manage market risk and protect your portfolio.






Dollar-cost averaging won’t protect you against market risk. But investing the same amount of money on a regular schedule can help you ride out ups and downs in the market, taking advantage of periods of both low costs and high returns.


  Study Currency Profiles  

If you are investing in foreign markets, pay attention to the currency profiles of the companies in which you invest. Industries that import more, for example, will be impacted by changes to the local currency. Industries that export more will be affected by changes to the value of the euro or dollar. Allocate your assets across a variety of industries to mitigate risk, and invest in markets and companies backed by strong currencies.


  Watch Interest Rates  

To manage interest rate risk, pay attention to monetary policy and be prepared to shift your investments to account for interest rate changes. For example, if you are heavily invested in bonds and interest rates are rising, you may want to tweak your investments to focus on shorter-term bonds.


  Maintain Liquidity  

When markets are volatile, you may have trouble selling or buying an asset within your price range, especially when you need to exit a position in a hurry. If the market is crashing, liquidity may be difficult no matter what type of stocks you buy. Under more normal conditions, though, you can maintain your liquidity by sticking with stocks that have low impact cost (the cost of a transaction for that stock) to make trading easier.


  Invest in Staples  

Some industries tend to do well even when the overall economy is poor. These tend to be utilities and businesses producing consumer staples. That’s because no matter what the economy is doing, people still need to turn their lights on, still need to eat, and still need toilet paper and toothpaste. By keeping some of your money in staples, you can still see returns in a recession or a period of high unemployment.


  Think Long Term  

No matter where you invest your money, it is impossible to fully escape market risk and volatility. But you can manage this risk, and escape much of the impact of volatile markets, by using a long-term investing strategy. You may want to make small tweaks in response to changes in the market. But don’t upend your entire investing strategy because a recession hit or a currency changed value.



In general, short-term traders are more impacted by volatility. By contrast, over time, volatility tends to even out over time. By approaching your investing systematically, and sticking with a long-term outlook and strategy, you are more likely to see your portfolio bounce back from the impact of market risks.


   Measuring Market Risk  

To measure market risk, investors and analysts often use the value-at-risk (VaR) method. VaR modeling is a statistical risk management method that quantifies a stock’s or portfolio’s potential loss as well as the probability of that potential loss occurring. While well-known and widely utilized, the VaR method requires certain assumptions that limit its precision.



For example, it assumes that the makeup and content of the portfolio being measured are unchanged over a specified period. Though this may be acceptable for short-term horizons, it may provide less accurate measurements for long-term investments.


  Value at Risk (VaR)  

VaR is a statistical measure that calculates the maximum potential loss a portfolio could experience over a given time period at a certain level of confidence. So, a VaR of 95% suggests that there is a 95% chance that the portfolio would not lose more than the calculated amount over the given time period.



The historical method for computing VaR looks at one’s prior returns history and orders them from worst losses to greatest gains—following from the premise that past returns experience will inform future outcomes.
The variance-covariance method, also called the parametric method, does not look backward but instead assumes that gains and losses are normally distributed. Potential losses are framed in terms of the number of standard deviations from the mean.
Monte Carlo simulation uses computational models to simulate projected returns over hundreds or thousands of possible iterations. Then, it estimates the chances that a loss will occur to compute the VaR—say, what the maximum loss would be 5% of the time.


  Risk Premium  

The equity risk premium (ERP) is a measure of market risk that reflects the excess return that investors demand for investing in stocks over and above the risk-free rate of return. In other words, it is the implied additional compensation that investors require to hold an investment in the broader stock market, which is inherently riskier than holding a risk-free asset like U.S. Treasuries.



The ERP is calculated by subtracting the risk-free rate of return (usually the yield on a short-term or midterm government bond) from the expected return on the stock market. For example, if the expected return on the stock market is 10% and the risk-free rate is 2%, the ERP would be 8%.



The difference between the broader market risk premium (MRP) and the equity risk premium comes down to scope. The ERP is specific to the stock market, while the MRP is the additional return that’s expected on a diversified portfolio of investments held among various asset classes that is above the risk-free rate.






Beta is another relevant risk metric that measures the relative volatility or market risk of a security or portfolio compared to the market as a whole. It is used in the capital asset pricing model (CAPM) to calculate the expected return of an asset. A beta of 1.0 indicates a stock has market risk identical to the broader S&P 500, while a beta greater than 1 means that the asset is more volatile than the market. Beta can be used to estimate the market risk of a portfolio by calculating the weighted average beta of its constituent assets.




What’s the difference between market risk and specific risk?
Market risk and specific risk make up the two major categories of investment risk.Market risk, also called systematic risk, cannot be eliminated through diversification, though it can be hedged in other ways and tends to influence the entire market at the same time.Specific risk, in contrast, is unique to a specific company or industry. Specific risk, also known as unsystematic risk, diversifiable risk or residual risk, can be reduced through diversification.




What are some types of market risk?
The most common types of market risk include interest rate risk, equity risk, commodity risk, and currency risk.Interest rate risk covers the volatility that may accompany interest rate fluctuations and is most relevant to fixed-income investments.Equity risk is the risk involved in the changing prices of stock investments.Commodity risk covers the changing prices of commodities such as crude oil and corn.Currency risk, or exchange-rate risk, arises from the change in the price of one currency in relation to another. This may affect investors holding assets in another country.




How is market risk measured?
A widely used measure of market risk is the value-at-risk (VaR) method. VaR modeling is a statistical risk management method that quantifies a stock’s or portfolio’s potential loss as well as the probability of that potential loss occurring. While well-known, the VaR method requires certain assumptions that limit its precision.Beta is another relevant risk metric that measures the relative sensitivity of an asset to broader market movements. The equity risk premium (ERP) is the implied expected return that investors demand while holding market risk in the stock market, above and beyond that of the risk-free rate of return.




Is inflation a market risk?
Inflation can contribute to market risk by impacting business performance, consumer behavior, and investor confidence. Monetary policy may be used to counter inflation through higher interest rates, which can in turn lead to a recession, causing the entire market to slow down.This is different from inflationary risk, or the possibility that the rising prices caused by inflation could outpace the returns from your investment.Inflationary risk is not a specific type of market risk because it doesn’t impact the overall performance of financial markets. However, it is a type of investing risk. Diversification, investing early to take advantage of compound interest, and investing more aggressively when you are younger can all help minimize inflationary risk.


   The Bottom Line  

Market risk is the chance of incurring losses due to factors that affect the overall performance of financial markets, such as changes in interest rates, geopolitical events, or recessions. It is referred to as systematic risk since it cannot be eliminated through diversification. Specific risk, on the other hand, is unique to a particular stock or industry sector and can be minimized through diversification.



Market risk can be measured using methods such as the value-at-risk (VaR) method, risk premia, or beta coefficient.
What Is Market Risk Premium?  

The market risk premium (MRP) is the difference between the expected return on a market portfolio and the risk-free rate.



The market risk premium is equal to the slope of the security market line (SML), a graphical representation of the capital asset pricing model (CAPM). CAPM measures the required rate of return on equity investments, and it is an important element of modern portfolio theory (MPT) and discounted cash flows (DCF) valuation.





Key Takeaways

The market risk premium is the difference between the expected return on a market portfolio and the risk-free rate.It provides a quantitative measure of the extra return demanded by market participants for the increased risk.The market risk premium is measured as the slope of the security market line (SML) associated with the CAPM model.The market risk premium is broader and more diversified than the equity risk premium, which only considers the stock market. As a result, the equity risk premium is often higher.


   Understanding the Market Risk Premium  

Market risk premium describes the relationship between returns from an asset portfolio and treasury bond yields. The risk premium reflects the required returns, historical returns, and expected returns. The historical market risk premium will be the same for all investors. The required and expected market premiums, however, will differ from investor to investor based on risk tolerance and investing styles.



Investors require compensation for risk and opportunity costs. The risk-free rate is a theoretical interest rate that is paid by an investment with zero risks. Long-term yields on U.S. Treasuries have traditionally been used as a proxy for the risk-free rate because of the low default risk and have had relatively low yields as a result of this assumed reliability.



Equity market returns are based on expected returns on a broad benchmark index such as the Standard & Poor's 500 index of the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA). Real equity returns fluctuate with the operational performance of the underlying business.



Historical return rates have fluctuated as the economy matures and endures cycles, but conventional knowledge has generally estimated a long-term potential of approximately 8% annually.






   Calculation and Application  

The market risk premium can be calculated by subtracting the risk-free rate from the expected equity market return, providing a quantitative measure of the extra return demanded by market participants for the increased risk.



Once calculated, the equity risk premium can be used in important calculations such as CAPM. Between 1926 and 2014, the S&P 500 exhibited a 10.5% compounded annual rate of return, while the 30-day Treasury bill compounded at 5.1%. This indicates a market risk premium of 5.4%, based on these parameters.



The required rate of return for an individual asset can be calculated by multiplying the asset's beta coefficient by the market coefficient, then adding back the risk-free rate. This is often used as the discount rate in discounted cash flow, a popular valuation model.




What Is the Difference Between the Market Risk Premium and Equity Risk Premium?
The market risk premium (MRP) broadly describes the additional returns above the risk-free rate that investors require when putting a portfolio of assets at risk in the market. This would include the universe of investable assets, including stocks, bonds, real estate, and so on.The equity risk premium (ERP) looks more narrowly only at the excess returns of stocks over the risk-free rate. Because the market risk premium is broader and more diversified, the equity risk premium by itself tends to be larger.




What Is the Historical Market Risk Premium?
In the U.S., the market risk premium has hovered around 5.5% over the past decade. Historical risk premiums used in practice have been estimated to be as high as 12% and as low as 3%.




What Is Used for the Risk-Free Rate When Measuring the Market Risk Premium?
In the United States, the yield on government bonds such as 2-year Treasuries are the most oft-used risk-free rate of return.


   The Bottom Line  

The market risk premium is the difference between the expected return on a market portfolio and the risk-free rate. It provides a quantitative measure of the extra return demanded by market participants for an increased risk.
What Is Market Saturation?  

Market saturation arises when the volume of a product or service in a marketplace has been maximized. At the point of saturation, a company can only achieve further growth through new product improvements by taking existing market share from competitors or increasing overall consumer demand.





Key Takeaways

Market saturation happens when the volume for a product or service is maxed out in a given market.To help combat market saturation, firms create products that wear down over time and need replacing, such as light bulbs.Companies can deal with market saturation with creativity, effective pricing, or unique marketing strategies.Smaller companies with niche products may find opportunities within saturated markets.An example of a micro-market saturation would be three ice cream parlors within a two-block radius in a town. 


   Understanding Market Saturation  

Market saturation can be both microeconomic or macroeconomic. From a micro perspective, market saturation is when a specific market is no longer providing new demand for an individual firm. This is often the case when a company faces fierce competition or reduces the market's need for its product or service.



From a macro perspective, market saturation occurs when an entire customer base has been serviced, and there are no new customer acquisition opportunities for any firm operating in the industry.



Many companies have intentionally designed their products to "wear down" or otherwise need replacement at some point to stop this phenomenon. For example, selling light bulbs that never burned out would limit consumer demand for some of General Electric's products.



Market saturation has also caused many companies to change their revenue models, especially when product sales begin to slow. IBM, for example, changed its business model toward providing recurring services once it saw saturation in the large computer server market.﻿﻿






Market saturation happens when a specific market no longer demands a product or service (microeconomic) or when the entire market has no new demand (macroeconomic).


   Special Considerations  

Even in light of market saturation, many companies choose to remain in operation. When a company operates in a saturated market, there are a few concepts and strategies that they can use to stand out, stay solvent, and possibly even increase sales. The first is creativity. A company's product or service offering has to be more innovative in a saturated market than its competitors to entice customers to buy.



The second way to stand out is through effective pricing. Companies can approach this in one of two ways. A company can choose to become the low-cost provider of a product or service or decide to operate as a premium option for the product or service. Either strategy requires competitive pricing against other companies that choose the same pricing structure; however, companies that operate in a saturated market usually end up waging price wars with each other, continuously undercutting prices to attract customers.



Using unique marketing strategies is a third way a company can stand out in a saturated market. When a market is saturated with product and service options, especially when those options are somewhat homogeneous, effective marketing is often the difference-maker for a company.


   Examples of Market Saturation  
  Real Estate Agents  

When you are a realtor and make your living selling homes, operating in a saturated real estate market can be challenging. Residential real estate markets ebb and flow depending on many factors. Still, when the market is saturated, it often rings a drop on houses, and in turn, a hit for realtors' salaries. Real estate agents in a small town or city may have to jockey for business when housing stock is limited, as well.


   Market Saturation FAQs  
  What Does Market Saturation Mean?  

Market saturation happens when products or services in a particular market are no longer in demand due to multiple offerings by competition or simply less in demand. There are two kinds of market saturation: Micro market saturation means a specific market is no longer needed due to competition or a reduction in consumer interest or desire, such as a trend or fad that winds down. Macro market saturation is when an entire customer base is covered.


  How Do You Tell If a Market is Saturated?  

A saturated market often includes a handful of major suppliers who all sell a specific product or products with potentially low-profit margins that make entering the market not as enticing to new companies. For example, if you want to sell ice cream in your town but your town already has three other ice cream stores, the market would be saturated.


  What Product Has Saturated the Market?  

Meal delivery services, e-grocers, and other commerce and cellphones are all products that have saturated their niche markets. When a specific product


  How Do You Calculate Market Saturation?  

A saturated market or oversaturated market can make it challenging to get consumers' attention. To calculate market share, which is a way to get to market saturation, you can look at the industry's total sales. For example, if you are in the pre-packaged meals e-grocery market, you would look at the entire industry's sales for those items and divide it by your company's total sales. This should show you the percentage there is available for your product to fill. Also, researching the supply versus the need for a product or service could help you calculate market saturation.


  How Do You Overcome Market Saturation?  

Creative marketing, reviewing pricing and lowering if necessary, and offering new customer service options or trying out a niche market product within the saturated market are all ways to overcome market saturation.
What Is a Market Segment?  

The term market segment refers to people who are grouped together for marketing purposes. Market segments are part of a larger market, often lumping individuals together based on one or more similar characteristics. Corporations and their marketing teams use various criteria to develop a target market for their products and services. Marketing professionals approach each segment differently, but only after they fully understand the needs, lifestyles, demographics, and personality of the target consumer.





Key Takeaways

A market segment is a group of people who share one or more similar characteristics.Corporations and marketing teams use various criteria to develop target markets for their products and services.The criteria for a market segment include homogeneity among the segment's main needs, uniqueness, and a common reaction to marketing tactics.The reaction from market segments to marketing plans or strategies is typically very predictable.Common market segment traits include interests, lifestyle, age, and gender.

   How Market Segments Work  

A market segment is a category of customers who have similar likes and dislikes in an otherwise homogeneous market. These customers can be individuals, families, businesses, organizations, or a blend of multiple types.



Market segments are known to respond somewhat predictably to a marketing strategy, plan, or promotion. This is why marketers use segmentation when deciding on a target market. As its name suggests, market segmentation is the process of separating a market into sub-groups, in which its members share common characteristics.



To meet the most basic criteria of a market segment, three characteristics must be present:



there must be homogeneity among the common needs of the segmentthere needs to be a distinction that makes the segment unique from other groupsthe presence of a common reaction or a similar and somewhat predictable response to marketing is required



Common characteristics of a market segment include interests, lifestyle, age, gender, etc. Common examples of market segmentation include geographic, demographic, psychographic, and behavioral.






Companies that understand market segments can prove themselves to be effective marketers while earning a greater return on their investments.


   Examples of Market Segments and Market Segmentation  

The banking industry provides a very good example of how a company markets to specific market segments. All commercial banks service a wide range of people, many of whom have relatable life situations and monetary goals. If a bank wants to market to baby boomers, it conducts research and may find that retirement planning is the most important aspect of their financial needs. The bank can then market tax-deferred accounts to this consumer segment.



If the same bank wants to effectively market products and services to millennials, Roth IRAs and 401(k)s may not be the best option. Instead, the bank may conduct in-depth market research and discover most millennials are planning to have a family. The bank uses that data to market college-friendly savings and investment accounts to this consumer segment.



Sometimes a company already has a product but may not yet have its target consumer segment. In this scenario, it is up to the business to define its market and cater its offering to its target group. Restaurants are a good example. If a restaurant is near a college, it can market its food in such a way as to entice college students to enjoy happy hour rather than trying to attract high-value business customers.




How Are Market Segments Used?
Commonly used in marketing strategies, market segments help companies optimize their products and services to suit the needs of a given segment. Market segments are often used to identify a target market.




How Do You Identify Market Segments?
Broadly speaking, identifying a market segment requires the following three criteria. To start, the main needs of a sub-group must be homogenous. Second, the segment must share distinct characteristics. Finally, the segment produces a similar response to marketing techniques. Prospective buyers are grouped into various segments, often based on how much value they place on a product or service.




What Is an Example of a Market Segment?
Consider a company that markets health and beauty products to both men and women. These products, such as razors or skin care, are typically more expensive for women than they are for men. The product packaging also differs—products targeted to women having pinks and floral accents that align with gender stereotypes. On the other hand, the company's male-targeted products are characterized by more rugged blacks and greys.
What Is Market Segmentation?  

Market segmentation is a marketing term that refers to aggregating prospective buyers into groups or segments with common needs and who respond similarly to a marketing action. Market segmentation enables companies to target different categories of consumers who perceive the full value of certain products and services differently from one another.





Key Takeaways

Market segmentation seeks to identify targeted groups of consumers to tailor products and branding in a way that is attractive to the group.Markets can be segmented in several ways such as geographically, demographically, or behaviorally.Market segmentation helps companies minimize risk by figuring out which products are the most likely to earn a share of a target market and the best ways to market and deliver those products to the market.With risk minimized and clarity about the marketing and delivery of a product heightened, a company can then focus its resources on efforts likely to be the most profitable.Market segmentation can also increase a company's demographic reach and may help the company discover products or services they hadn't previously considered.

   Understanding Market Segmentation  

Companies can generally use three criteria to identify different market segments:



Homogeneity, or common needs within a segmentDistinction, or being unique from other groupsReaction, or a similar response to the market



For example, an athletic footwear company might have market segments for basketball players and long-distance runners. As distinct groups, basketball players and long-distance runners respond to very different advertisements. Understanding these different market segments enables the athletic footwear company to market its branding appropriately.



Market segmentation is an extension of market research that seeks to identify targeted groups of consumers to tailor products and branding in a way that is attractive to the group. The objective of market segmentation is to minimize risk by determining which products have the best chances of gaining a share of a target market and determining the best way to deliver the products to the market. This allows the company to increase its overall efficiency by focusing limited resources on efforts that produce the best return on investment (ROI).






Market segmentation allows a company to increase its overall efficiency by focusing limited resources on efforts that produce the best return on investment (ROI).


   Types of Market Segmentation  

There are four primary types of market segmentation. However, one type can usually be split into an individual segment and an organization segment. Therefore, below are five common types of market segmentation.


  Demographic Segmentation  

Demographic segmentation is one of the simple, common methods of market segmentation. It involves breaking the market into customer demographics as age, income, gender, race, education, or occupation. This market segmentation strategy assumes that individuals with similar demographics will have similar needs.



Example: The market segmentation strategy for a new video game console may reveal that most users are young males with disposable income.


  Firmographic Segmentation  

Firmographic segmentation is the same concept as demographic segmentation. However, instead of analyzing individuals, this strategy looks at organizations and looks at a company's number of employees, number of customers, number of offices, or annual revenue.



Example: A corporate software provider may approach a multinational firm with a more diverse, customizable suite while approaching smaller companies with a fixed fee, more simple product.


  Geographic Segmentation  

Geographic segmentation is technically a subset of demographic segmentation. This approach groups customers by physical location, assuming that people within a given geographical area may have similar needs. This strategy is more useful for larger companies seeking to expand into different branches, offices, or locations.



Example: A clothing retailer may display more raingear in their Pacific Northwest locations compared to their Southwest locations.


  Behavioral Segmentation  

Behavioral segmentation relies heavily on market data, consumer actions, and decision-making patterns of customers. This approach groups consumers based on how they have previously interacted with markets and products. This approach assumes that consumers prior spending habits are an indicator of what they may buy in the future, though spending habits may change over time or in response to global events.



Example: Millennial consumers traditionally buy more craft beer, while older generations are traditionally more likely to buy national brands.


  Psychographic Segmentation  

Often the most difficult market segmentation approach, psychographic segmentation strives to classify consumers based on their lifestyle, personality, opinions, and interests. This may be more difficult to achieve, as these traits (1) may change easily and (2) may not have readily available objective data. However, this approach may yield strongest market segment results as it groups individuals based on intrinsic motivators as opposed to external data points.



Example: A fitness apparel company may target individuals based on their interest in playing or watching a variety of sports.






Other less notable examples of types of segmentation include volume (i.e. how much a consumer spends), use-related (i.e. how loyal a customer is), or other customer traits (i.e. how innovative or risk-favorable a customer is).


   How to Determine Your Market Segment  

There's no single universally accepted way to perform market segmentation. To determine your market segments, it's common for companies to ask themselves the following questions along their market segmentation journey.



Phase I: Setting Expectations/Objectives



What is the purpose or goal of performing market segmentation? What does the company hope to find out by performing marketing segmentation?Does the company have any expectations on what market segments may exist?



Phase 2: Identify Customer Segments



What segments are the company's competitors selling to? 
What publicly available information (i.e. U.S. Census Bureau data) is relevant and available to our market? 
What data do we want to collect, and how can we collect it?
Which of the five types of market segments do we want to segment by?



Phase 3: Evaluate Potential Segments



What risks are there that our data is not representative of the true market segments?Why should we choose to cater to one type of customer over another?What is the long-term repercussion of choosing one market segment over another?What is the company's ideal customer profile, and which segments best overlap with this "perfect customer"?



Phase 4: Develop Segment Strategy



How can the company test its assumptions on a sample test market?What defines a successful marketing segment strategy?How can the company measure whether the strategy is working?



Phase 5: Launch and Monitor



Who are key stakeholders that can provide feedback after the market segmentation strategy has been unveiled?
What barriers to execution exist, and how can they can be overcome?
How should the launch of the marketing campaign be communicated internally?


   Benefits of Market Segmentation  

Marketing segmentation takes effort and resources to implement. However, successful marketing segmentation campaigns can increase the long-term profitability and health of a company. Several benefits of market segmentation include;



Increased resource efficiency. Marketing segmentation allows management to focus on certain demographics or customers. Instead of trying to promote products to the entire market, marketing segmentation allows a focused, precise approach that often costs less compared to a broad reach approach.
Stronger brand image. Marketing segment forces management to consider how it wants to be perceived by a specific group of people. Once the market segment is identified, management must then consider what message to craft. Because this message is directed at a target audience, a company's branding and messaging is more likely to be very intentional. This may also have an indirect effect of causing better customer experiences with the company.
Greater potential for brand loyalty. Marketing segmentation increases the opportunity for consumers to build long-term relationships with a company. More direct, personal marketing approaches may resonate with customers and foster a sense of inclusion, community, and a sense of belonging. In addition, market segmentation increases the probability that you land the right client that fits your product line and demographic.
Stronger market differentiation. Market segmentation gives a company the opportunity to pinpoint the exact message they way to convey to the market and to competitors. This can also help create product differentiation by communicating specifically how a company is different from its competitors. Instead of a broad approach to marketing, management crafts a specific image that is more likely to be memorable and specific.
Better targeted digital advertising. Marketing segmentation enables a company to perform better targeted advertising strategies. This includes marketing plans that direct effort towards specific ages, locations, or habits via social media.






Market segmentation exists outside of business. There has been extensive research using market segmentation strategies to promote overcoming COVID-19 vaccination hesitancy and other health initiatives.


   Limitations of Market Segmentation  

The benefits above can't be achieved with some potential downsides. Here are some disadvantages to consider when considering implementing market segmentation strategies.



Higher upfront marketing expenses. Marketing segmentation has the long-term goal of being efficient. However, to capture this efficiency, companies must often spend resources upfront to gain the insight, data, and research into their customer base and the broad markets.
Increased product line complexity. Marketing segmentation takes a large market and attempts to break it into more specific, manageable pieces. This has the downside risk of creating an overly complex, fractionalized product line that focuses too deeply on catering to specific market segments. Instead of a company having a cohesive product line, a company's marketing mix may become too confusing and inconsistently communicate its overall brand.
Greater risk of misassumptions. Market segmentation is rooted in the assumption that similar demographics will share common needs. This may not always be the case. By grouping a population together with the belief that they share common traits, a company may risk misidentifying the needs, values, or motivations within individuals of a given population.
Higher reliance on reliable data. Market segmentation is only as strong as the underlying data that support the claims that are made. This means being mindful of what sources are used to pull in data. This also means being conscious of changing trends and when market segments may have shifted from prior studies.


   Examples of Market Segmentation  

Market segmentation is evident in the products, marketing, and advertising that people use every day. Auto manufacturers thrive on their ability to identify market segments correctly and create products and advertising campaigns that appeal to those segments.



Cereal producers market actively to three or four market segments at a time, pushing traditional brands that appeal to older consumers and healthy brands to health-conscious consumers, while building brand loyalty among the youngest consumers by tying their products to, say, popular children's movie themes.



A sports-shoe manufacturer might define several market segments that include elite athletes, frequent gym-goers, fashion-conscious women, and middle-aged men who want quality and comfort in their shoes. In all cases, the manufacturer's marketing intelligence about each segment enables it to develop and advertise products with a high appeal more efficiently than trying to appeal to the broader masses.




What Is Market Segmentation?
Market segmentation is a marketing strategy in which select groups of consumers are identified so that certain products or product lines can be presented to them in a way that appeals to their interests.




Why Is Market Segmentation Important?
Market segmentation realizes that not all customers have the same interests, purchasing power, or consumer needs. Instead of catering to all prospective clients broadly, market segmentation is important because it strives to make a company's marketing endeavors more strategic and refined. By developing specific plans for specific products with target audiences in mind, a company can increase its chances of generating sales and being more efficient with resources.




What Are the Types of Market Segmentation?
Types of segmentation include homogeneity, which looks at a segment's common needs, distinction, which looks at how the particular group stands apart from others, and reaction, or how certain groups respond to the market.




What Are Some Market Segmentation Strategies?
Strategies include targeting a group by location, by demographics—such as age or gender—by social class or lifestyle, or behaviorally—such as by use or response.




What Is an Example of Market Segmentation?
Upon analysis of its target audience and desired brand image, Crypto.com entered into an agreement with Matt Damon to promote their platform and cryptocurrency investing. With backdrops of space exploration and historical feats of innovation, Crypto.com's market segmentation targeted younger, bolder, more risk-accepting individuals.


   The Bottom Line  

Market segmentation is a process companies use to break their potential customers into different sections. This allows the company to allocate the appropriate resource to each individual segment which allows for more accurate targeting across a variety of marketing campaigns.
What Is Market Segmentation Theory?  

Market segmentation theory is a theory that long and short-term interest rates are not related to each other. It also states that the prevailing interest rates for short, intermediate, and long-term bonds should be viewed separately like items in different markets for debt securities.





Key Takeaways

Market segmentation theory states that long- and short-term interest rates are not related to each other because they have different investors.Related to the market segmentation theory is the preferred habitat theory, which states that investors prefer to remain in their own bond maturity range due to guaranteed yields. Any shift to a different maturity range is perceived as risky.


   Understanding Market Segmentation Theory  

This theory's major conclusions are that yield curves are determined by supply and demand forces within each market/category of debt security maturities and that the yields for one category of maturities cannot be used to predict the yields for a different category of maturities.



Market segmentation theory is also known as the segmented markets theory. It is based on the belief that the market for each segment of bond maturities consists mainly of investors who have a preference for investing in securities with specific durations: short, intermediate, or long-term.



Market segmentation theory further asserts that the buyers and sellers who make up the market for short-term securities have different characteristics and motivations than buyers and sellers of intermediate and long-term maturity securities. The theory is partially based on the investment habits of different types of institutional investors, such as banks and insurance companies. Banks generally favor short-term securities, while insurance companies generally favor long-term securities.


   A Reluctance to Change Categories  

A related theory that expounds upon the market segmentation theory is the preferred habitat theory. The preferred habitat theory states that investors have preferred ranges of bond maturity lengths and that most shift from their preferences only if they are guaranteed higher yields. While there may be no identifiable difference in market risk, an investor accustomed to investing in securities within a specific maturity category often perceives a category shift as risky.


   Implications for Market Analysis  

The yield curve is a direct result of the market segmentation theory. Traditionally, the yield curve for bonds is drawn across all maturity length categories, reflecting a yield relationship between short-term and long-term interest rates. However, advocates of the market segmentation theory suggest that examining a traditional yield curve covering all maturity lengths is a fruitless endeavor because short-term rates are not predictive of long-term rates.
What is Market Sentiment?  

Market sentiment refers to the overall attitude of investors toward a particular security or financial market. It is the feeling or tone of a market, or its crowd psychology, as revealed through the activity and price movement of the securities traded in that market. In broad terms, rising prices indicate bullish market sentiment, while falling prices indicate bearish market sentiment.





Key Takeaways

Market sentiment refers to the overall consensus about a stock or the stock market as a whole.Market sentiment is bullish when prices are rising.Market sentiment is bearish when prices are falling.Technical indicators can help investors measure market sentiment.






   Understanding Market Sentiment  

Market sentiment, also called "investor sentiment," is not always based on fundamentals. Day traders and technical analysts rely on market sentiment, as it influences the technical indicators they utilize to measure and profit from short-term price movements often caused by investor attitudes toward a security. Market sentiment is also important to contrarian investors who like to trade in the opposite direction of the prevailing consensus. For example, if everyone is buying, a contrarian would sell.



Investors typically describe market sentiment as bearish or bullish. When bears are in control, stock prices are going down. When bulls are in control, stock prices are going up. Emotion often drives the stock market, so market sentiment is not always synonymous with fundamental value. That is, market sentiment is about feelings and emotion, whereas fundamental value is about business performance.



Some investors profit by finding stocks that are overvalued or undervalued based on market sentiment. They use various indicators to measure market sentiment that help determine the best stocks to trade. Popular sentiment indicators include the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX), High-Low Index, Bullish Percent Index (BPI) and moving averages.


   Indicators to Measure Market Sentiment  
  The VIX  

﻿The VIX, also known as the fear index, is driven by option prices. A rising VIX means an increased need for insurance in the market. If traders feel the need to protect against risk, it's a sign of increasing volatility. Traders add moving averages to the VIX that help determine if it's relatively high or low.


  The High-Low Index  

The high-low index compares the number of stocks making 52-week highs to the number of stocks making 52-week lows. When the index is below 30, stock prices are trading near their lows, and investors have a bearish market sentiment. When the index is above 70, stock prices are trading toward their highs, and investors have a bullish market sentiment. Traders usually apply the indicator to a specific underlying index, such as the S&P 500, Nasdaq 100 or NYSE Composite.


  Bullish Percent Index  

The bullish percent index (BPI) measures the number of stocks with bullish patterns based on point and figure charts. Neutral markets have a bullish percentage around 50%. When the BPI gives a reading of 80% or higher, market sentiment is extremely optimistic, with stocks likely overbought. Likewise, when it measures 20% or below, market sentiment is negative and indicates an oversold market.


  Moving Averages  

Investors typically use the 50-day simple moving average (SMA) and 200-day SMA when determining a market’s sentiment.



When the 50-day SMA crosses above the 200-day SMA – referred to as a “golden cross,” it indicates that momentum has shifted to the upside, creating bullish sentiment. Conversely, when the 50-day SMA crosses below the 200-day SMA – referred to as a “death cross,” it suggests lower prices, generating bearish sentiment.


   Real World Example of Market Sentiment  

Market sentiment turned bearish in December 2018 when several factors worked together to unnerve investors. Firstly, fears grew over slowing corporate earnings. After several years of double-digit earnings growth for many companies in the S&P 500, many analysts predicted that 2019 earnings would increase by just 3–4%.



Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell stoked those fears at his monthly press conference when he said the central bank’s balance sheet runoff was on autopilot. The market viewed his comments as “hawkish” and not accommodative for a slowing economy, which further dampened market sentiment.



Finally, unresolved trade tensions between the United States and China that saw tit-for-tat tariffs imposed by the world’s two largest economies throughout 2018, as well as a U.S. government shutdown, compounded with the issues above to severely damage market sentiment over the month.



Bearish sentiment damaged investor confidence that caused the stock market to have its worst December performance since 1931. The broad-based S&P 500 index fell 9.2% for the month, while the Dow Jones Industrial Index (DJIA), comprising of 30 industrial bellwether companies, shed 8.7% over the period.



The S&P 500 High-Low index fell below 30 in late December and remained near zero until mid-January, showing the extent of bearish sentiment gripping the market at that time.

What Is Market Share?  

Market share is the percent of total sales in an industry generated by a particular company. Market share is calculated by taking the company's sales over the period and dividing it by the total sales of the industry over the same period. This metric is used to give a general idea of the size of a company in relation to its market and its competitors. The market leader in an industry is the company with the largest market share.





Key Takeaways

Market share represents the percentage of an industry, or a market's total sales, that is earned by a particular company over a specified time period.Market share is calculated by taking the company's sales over the period and dividing it by the total sales of the industry over the same period.This metric is used to give a general idea of the size of a company in relation to its market and its competitors.A market leader is a company in an industry that has the highest market share and generally wields the most influence.Ways to increase market share include implementing new technologies, generating customer loyalty, and acquiring competitors.

   Understanding Market Share  

A company's market share is its portion of total sales in relation to the market or industry in which it operates. To calculate a company's market share, first determine a period you want to examine. It can be a fiscal quarter, year, or multiple years.



Next, calculate the company's total sales over that period. Then, find out the total sales of the company's industry. Finally, divide the company's total revenues by its industry's total sales. For example, if a company sold $100 million in tractors last year domestically, and the total amount of tractors sold in the U.S. was $200 million, the company's U.S. market share for tractors would be 50%.



The calculation for market share is usually done for specific countries or regions, e.g. companies will report their North American or Canadian market share. Investors can obtain market share data from various independent sources, such as trade groups and regulatory bodies, and often from the company itself; however, some industries are harder to measure with accuracy than others.


  Formula for Market Share  

Market Share = Total Company Sales / Total Industry Sales


   Benefits of Market Share  

Investors and analysts monitor increases and decreases in market share carefully as this can be a sign of the relative competitiveness of the company's products or services. As the total market for a product or service grows, a company that is maintaining its market share is growing revenues at the same rate as the total market. A company that is growing its market share will be growing its revenues faster than its competitors.






Gains or losses in market share can have a significant impact on a company's stock performance, depending on industry conditions.



Market share increases can allow a company to achieve greater scale with its operations and improve profitability. A company can try to expand its share of the market, either by lowering prices, using advertising, or introducing new or different products. In addition, it can also grow the size of its market share by appealing to other audiences or demographics. 


   Market Share Impact  

Changes in market share have a larger impact on the performance of companies in mature or cyclical industries where there is low growth. In contrast, changes in market share have less impact on companies in growth industries. In these industries, the total pie is growing, so companies can still be growing sales even if they are losing market share. For companies in this situation, the stock performance is more affected by sales growth and margins than other factors.



In cyclical industries, competition for market share is brutal. Economic factors play a larger role in the variance of sales, earnings, and margins, more than other factors. Margins tend to be low and operations run at maximum efficiency due to competition. Since sales come at the expense of other companies, they invest heavily in marketing efforts or even loss leaders to attract sales.



In these industries, companies may be willing to lose money on products temporarily to force competitors to give up or declare bankruptcy. Once they gain greater market share and competitors are ousted, they attempt to raise prices. This strategy can work, or it can backfire, compounding their losses; however, this is the reason why many industries are dominated by a few big players, such as discount wholesale retail with stores including Sam's Club, BJ's Wholesale Club, and Costco.


   How Can Companies Increase Market Share?  

A company can increase its market share by offering its customers innovative technology, strengthening customer loyalty, hiring talented employees, and acquiring competitors.


  New Technology  

Innovation is one method by which a company may increase market share. When a firm brings to market a new technology its competitors have yet to offer, consumers wishing to own the technology buy it from that company, even if they previously did business with a competitor. Many of those consumers become loyal customers, which adds to the company's market share and decreases market share for the company from which they switched.


  Customer Loyalty  

By strengthening customer relationships, companies protect their existing market share by preventing current customers from jumping ship when a competitor rolls out a hot new offer. Better still, companies can grow market share using the same simple tactic, as satisfied customers frequently speak of their positive experience to friends and relatives who then become new customers. Gaining market share via word of mouth increases a company's revenues without concomitant increases in marketing expenses.


  Talented Employees  

Companies with the highest market share in their industries almost invariably have the most skilled and dedicated employees. Bringing the best employees on board reduces expenses related to turnover and training, and enables companies to devote more resources to focus on their core competencies. Offering competitive salaries and benefits is one proven way to attract the best employees; however, employees in the 21st century also seek intangible benefits such as flexible schedules and casual work environments.


  Acquisitions  

Lastly, one of the surest methods to increase market share is acquiring a competitor. By doing so, a company accomplishes two things. It taps into the newly acquired firm's existing customer base, and it reduces the number of firms fighting for a slice of the same pie by one. Shrewd executives, whether in charge of small businesses or large corporations, always have their eye out for a good acquisition deal when their companies are in a growth model.


   Market Share Example  

All multinational corporations measure success based on the market share of specific markets. China has been an important market for companies, as it is still a fast-growing market for many products. Apple Inc., for example, uses its market share numbers in China as a key performance indicator for the growth of its business.



Apple's market share for China's smartphone market was tied for second place in Q4 2020 with Vivo and Oppo at 17%. At the time, 29% of China's mobile phone market was made up of many other brands. Over the course of Q1 to Q3, Apple saw its market share in China drop to 12%, losing out to Vivo and Oppo. In Q4 2021, Apple experienced a bounce back to 22%. In Q1 2022 it remained at 18%.




What Is Market Share?
Market share shows the size of a company, a useful metric in illustrating a company’s dominance and competitiveness in a given field. Market share is calculated as the percentage of company sales compared to the total share of sales in its respective industry over a time period. A company’s market share can influence its operations significantly, namely, its share performance, scalability, and prices that it can offer for its product or services. 




Why Is Market Share Important?
Simply put, market share is a key indicator of a company’s competitiveness. When a company increases its market share, this can improve its profitability. This is because as companies increase in size, they too can scale, therefore offering lower prices and limiting their competitors' growth.In some cases, companies may go so far as operating at a loss in some divisions in order to push out the competitors or force them into bankruptcy. After this point, the company may increase its market share, and further increase prices. In financial markets, market share can greatly affect stock prices, especially in cyclical industries when margins are narrow and competition is fierce. Any marked difference in market share may trigger weakness or strength in investor sentiment. 




What Strategies Are Used to Gain Market Share?
To gain greater market share, a company may apply one of many strategies. First, it may introduce new technology to attract customers that may have otherwise purchased from their competitor. Second, nurturing customer loyalty is a tactic that can result in both a solid existing customer base and expansion through word of mouth. Third, hiring talented employees prevents costly employee turnover expenses, allowing the company to instead prioritize its core competencies. Finally, with an acquisition, a company can both reduce the number of competitors and acquire their base of customers. 




How Do You Measure Market Share?
To determine a company's market share, you take the total sales of a company and divide it by its industry's total sales over a given period. For example, if a company sold $2 million worth of dishwashing liquid and the industry's total sales were $15 million, the company would have a market share of 2/15 = 13.3%




What Is a Low Market Share?
A low market share is considered to be a market share that is less than half of the market share of the industry leader. So if the industry leader has a market share of 40% and another company has a market share of 10%, that company would be considered to have a low market share as 10% is less than 20% (half of 40%).


   The Bottom Line  

Market share is the percent of total industry sales that a company has. The higher the market share, the more sales a company has than its competitors in their given industry. Market share is an indicator of how large a company is and the amount of influence it has in its industry. It can also be an indicator of growth and success.



Companies generally seek to increase their market share. Ways to do this are by implementing new technologies, delivering a higher quality product, implementing good marketing, acquiring competitors, and generating customer loyalty.
What Is Market Timing?  

Market timing is the act of moving investment money in or out of a financial market—or switching funds between asset classes—based on predictive methods. If investors can predict when the market will go up and down, they can make trades to turn that market move into a profit.



Timing the market is often a key component of actively managed investment strategies, and is almost always a basic strategy for traders. Predictive methods for guiding market timing decisions may include fundamental, technical, quantitative, or economic data.



Many investors, academics, and financial professionals believe it is impossible to time the market. Other investors—particularly, active traders—believe strongly in market timing. Whether successful market timing is possible is a matter for debate, though nearly all market professionals agree that doing so for any substantial length of time is a difficult task.





Key Takeaways

Market timing is the act of moving investment money in or out of a financial market—or switching funds between asset classes—based on predictive methods.If investors can predict when the market will go up and down, they can make trades to turn that market move into a profit.Market timing is the opposite of a buy-and-hold strategy, where investors buy securities and hold them for a long period, regardless of market volatility.While feasible for traders, portfolio managers, and other financial professionals, market timing can be difficult for the average individual investor.For the average investor who does not have the time or desire to watch the market daily—or in some cases hourly—there are good reasons to avoid market timing and focus on investing for the long run.


   Understanding Market Timing  

Market timing is not impossible to do. Short-term trading strategies have been successful for professional day traders, portfolio managers, and full-time investors who use chart analysis, economic forecasts, and even gut feelings to decide the optimal times to buy and sell securities. However, few investors have been able to predict market shifts with such consistency that they gain any significant advantage over the buy-and-hold investor.



Market timing is sometimes considered to be the opposite of a long-term buy-and-hold investment strategy. However, even a buy-and-hold approach is subject to some degree of market timing as a result of investors shifting needs or attitudes. The key difference is whether or not the investor expects market timing to be a pre-defined part of their strategy.


   Advantages and Disadvantages of Market Timing  

For the average investor who does not have the time or desire to watch the market daily—or in some cases hourly—there are good reasons to avoid market timing and focus on investing for the long run. Active investors would argue that long-term investors miss out on gains by riding out volatility rather than locking in returns via market-timed exits. However, because it is extremely difficult to gauge the future direction of the stock market, investors who try to time entrances and exits often tend to underperform investors who remain invested.



Proponents of the strategy say the method allows them to realize larger profits and minimize losses by moving out of sectors before a downturn. By always seeking calmer investing waters they avoid the volatility of market movements when they are holding volatile equities.






For the average individual investor, market timing is likely to be less effective and produce smaller returns than buy-and-hold or other passive strategies.



However, for many investors, the real costs are almost always greater than the potential benefit of shifting in and out of the market.



"Quantitative Analysis of Investor Behavior," a report available for purchase from Boston research firm Dalbar, shows that an investor who remained fully invested in the Standard & Poor’s (S&P) 500 Index between 1995 and 2014 would have earned a 9.85% annualized return. However, if they missed only 10 of the best days in the market, the return would have been 5.1%. Some of the biggest upswings in the market occur during a volatile period when many investors fled the market.



Mutual fund investors who move in and out of funds and fund groups trying to time the market or chase surging funds underperform the indices by as much as 3%—largely due to the transaction costs and commissions they incur, especially when investing in funds with expense ratios greater than 1%.



Buying low and selling high, if done successfully, generates tax consequences on the profits. If the investment is held less than a year, the profit is taxed at the short-term capital gains rate or the investor's ordinary income tax rate, which is higher than the long-term capital gains rate.





Advantages of Market Timing

Bigger profits
Curtailed losses
Avoidance of volatility
Suited to short-term investment horizons



Disadvantages of Market Timing

Daily attention to markets required
More frequent transaction costs, commissions
Tax-disadvantaged short-term capital gains
Difficulty in timing entrances and exits





   Criticism of Market Timing  

A landmark study, called "Likely Gains From Market Timing," published in the Financial Analyst Journal by Nobel Laureate William Sharpe in 1975, attempted to find how often a market timer must be accurate to perform as well as a passive index fund tracking a benchmark. Sharpe concluded that an investor employing a market timing strategy must be correct 74% of the time to beat the benchmark portfolio of similar risk annually.



And not even the professionals get it right. A 2017 study from the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College found that target-date funds that attempted market timing underperformed other funds by as much as 0.14 percentage points—a 3.8% difference over 30 years.



According to research by Morningstar, actively managed funds have generally failed to survive and beat their benchmarks, especially over longer time horizons. In fact, only 23% of all active funds surpassed the average of their passive rivals over the 10-year period ended June 2019. For foreign-stock funds and bond funds, long-term success rates were generally higher. Success rates were lowest among U.S. large-cap funds. 


   Market Timing FAQs  
  What Is Efficient Market Hypothesis?  

The efficient market hypothesis (EMH) states that asset prices reflect all available information. According to the EMH, it is impossible to "beat the market" consistently on a risk-adjusted basis since market prices should only react to new information.


  What Are Some Disadvantages of Market Timing?  

While market timing has many benefits, there are some drawbacks that should be kept in mind while adopting this approach. In order to be successful at market timing, it is necessary to keep a continuous check on the movement of securities, funds, and asset classes. This daily attention to the markets can be tedious, time-consuming, and draining.



Each time you enter or exit the market, there are transaction costs and commission expenses. Investors and traders who employ market timing strategies will have elevated transaction and commission costs.



Market timing can also result in a higher tax rate because when stocks are bought and sold within a year, the profit earned is taxed according to either the usual income tax rate or the short-term capital gains rate. Finally, market timing is a complex task. Determining the right entry and exit point can be challenging because the market and its trends keep changing constantly.


  Who Said, "Time in the Market, Not Timing the Market?"  

Keith Banks, Vice Chairman of Bank of America, said “The reality is, it’s time in the market, not timing the market" on CNBC’s “Squawk Box" in March 2020.


  Is It Really Impossible to Time the Market?  

Timing the market is a strategy that involves buying and selling stocks based on expected price changes. Prevailing wisdom says that timing the market doesn't work; most of the time, it is very challenging for investors to earn big profits by correctly timing buy and sell orders just before prices go up and down.



Investors often make investment decisions based on emotions. They may buy when a stock price is too high only because others are buying it. Alternatively, they may sell on one piece of bad news. For these reasons, most investors who are trying to time the market end up underperforming the broad market.


  What Is the Biggest Risk of Market Timing?  

The biggest risk of market timing is usually considered not being in the market at critical times. Investors who try to time the market run the risk of missing periods of exceptional returns.



It is very hard for investors to accurately pinpoint a market high or low point until after it has already occurred. For this reason, if an investor moves their money out of stocks during a market downturn, they risk not moving their money back in time to take advantage of gains from an upswing.
What Is Mark to Market (MTM)?  

Mark to market (MTM) is a method of measuring the fair value of accounts that can fluctuate over time, such as assets and liabilities. Mark to market aims to provide a realistic appraisal of an institution's or company's current financial situation based on current market conditions.



In trading and investing, certain securities, such as futures and mutual funds, are also marked to market to show the current market value of these investments.





Key Takeaways

Mark to market can present a more accurate figure for the current value of a company's assets, based on what the company might receive in exchange for the asset under current market conditions.However, during unfavorable or volatile times, MTM may not accurately represent an asset's true value in an orderly market.Mark to market is an alternative to historical cost accounting, which maintains an asset's value at the original purchase cost.In futures trading, accounts in a futures contract are marked to market on a daily basis. Profit and loss are calculated between the long and short positions.

   Understanding Mark to Market (MTM)  
  Mark to Market in Accounting  

Mark to market is an accounting practice that involves adjusting the value of an asset to reflect its value as determined by current market conditions. The market value is determined based on what a company would get for the asset if it was sold at that point in time.



At the end of the fiscal year, a company's balance sheet must reflect the current market value of certain accounts. Other accounts will maintain their historical cost, which is the original purchase price of an asset.


  Mark to Market in Financial Services  

Companies in the financial services industry may need to make adjustments to their asset accounts in the event that some borrowers default on their loans during the year. When these loans have been identified as bad debt, the lending company will need to mark down its assets to fair value through the use of a contra asset account such as the "allowance for bad debts."



A company that offers discounts to its customers in order to collect quickly on its accounts receivables (AR) will have to mark its AR to a lower value through the use of a contra asset account.



In this situation, the company would record a debit to accounts receivable and a credit to sales revenue for the full sales price. Then, using an estimate of the percentage of customers expected to take the discount, the company would record a debit to sales discount, a contra revenue account, and a credit to "allowance for sales discount," a contra asset account.


  Mark to Market in Personal Accounting  

In personal accounting, the market value is the same as the replacement cost of an asset.



For example, homeowner's insurance will list a replacement cost for the value of your home if there were ever a need to rebuild your home from scratch. This usually differs from the price you originally paid for your home, which is its historical cost to you.


  Mark to Market in Investing  

In securities trading, mark to market involves recording the price or value of a security, portfolio, or account to reflect the current market value rather than book value.



This is done most often in futures accounts to ensure that margin requirements are being met. If the current market value causes the margin account to fall below its required level, the trader will be faced with a margin call.



Mutual funds are also marked to market on a daily basis at the market close so that investors have a better idea of the fund's net asset value (NAV).


   Examples of Mark to Market  

An exchange marks traders' accounts to their market values daily by settling the gains and losses that result due to changes in the value of the security. There are two counterparties on either side of a futures contract—a long trader and a short trader. The trader who holds the long position in the futures contract is usually bullish, while the trader shorting the contract is considered bearish.



If at the end of the day, the futures contract entered into goes down in value, the long margin account will be decreased and the short margin account increased to reflect the change in the value of the derivative.



An increase in value results in an increase in the margin account holding the long position and a decrease in the short futures account.



For example, to hedge against falling commodity prices, a wheat farmer takes a short position in 10 wheat futures contracts on November 21st. Since each contract represents 5,000 bushels, the farmer is hedging against a price decline on 50,000 bushels of wheat. If the price of one contract is $4.50 on Nov. 21st. the wheat farmer's account will be recorded as $4.50 x 50,000 bushels = $225,000.

Because the farmer has a short position in wheat futures, a fall in the value of the contract will result in an increase in their account. Likewise, an increase in value will result in a decrease in account value. For example, on Day 2, wheat futures increased by $4.55 - $4.50 = $0.05, resulting in a loss for the day of $0.05 x 50,000 bushels = $2,500. While this amount is subtracted from the farmer's account balance, the exact amount will be added to the account of the trader on the other end of the transaction holding a long position on wheat futures.



The daily mark to market settlements will continue until the expiration date of the futures contract or until the farmer closes out his position by going long on a contract with the same maturity.






Note that the Account Balance is marked daily using the Gain/Loss column. The Cumulative Gain/Loss column shows the net change in the account since day 1.


   Special Considerations  

Problems can arise when the market-based measurement does not accurately reflect the underlying asset's true value. This can occur when a company is forced to calculate the selling price of its assets or liabilities during unfavorable or volatile times, as during a financial crisis.



For example, if the asset has low liquidity or investors are fearful, the current selling price of a bank's assets could be much lower than the actual value.



This issue was seen during the financial crisis of 2008–09 when the mortgage-backed securities (MBS) held as assets on banks' balance sheets could not be valued efficiently as the markets for these securities had disappeared.



In April of 2009, however, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) voted on and approved new guidelines that would allow for the valuation to be based on a price that would be received in an orderly market rather than a forced liquidation, starting in the first quarter of 2009.




How Does One Mark Assets to Market?
Mark to market is an accounting standard governed by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), which establishes the accounting and financial reporting guidelines for corporations and nonprofit organizations in the United States. FASB Statement of Interest "SFAS 157–Fair Value Measurements" provides a definition of "fair value" and how to measure it in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Assets must then be valued for accounting purposes at that fair value and updated on a regular basis.




Are All Assets Marked to Market?
Marking to market is the standard for the financial industry. It is used primarily to value financial assets and liabilities, which fluctuate in value. The accounting thus reflects both their gains and their losses in value.Other major industries such as retailers and manufacturers have most of their value in long-term assets, known as property, plant, and equipment (PPE), as well as assets like inventory and accounts receivable. All of these are recorded at historic cost and then impaired as circumstances indicate. Correcting for a loss of value for these assets is called impairment rather than marking to market.




What Are Mark to Market Losses?
Mark-to-market losses are paper losses generated through an accounting entry rather than the actual sale of a security.Mark-to-market losses occur when financial instruments held are valued at the current market value, which is lower than the price paid to acquire them.
What Is Market Value?  

Market value (also known as OMV, or "open market valuation") is the price an asset would fetch in the marketplace, or the value that the investment community gives to a particular equity or business.



Market value is also commonly used to refer to the market capitalization of a publicly traded company, and is calculated by multiplying the number of its outstanding shares by the current share price.



Market value is easiest to determine for exchange-traded instruments such as stocks and futures, since their market prices are widely disseminated and easily available, but is a little more challenging to ascertain for over-the-counter instruments like fixed income securities. However, the greatest difficulty in determining market value lies in estimating the value of illiquid assets like real estate and businesses, which may necessitate the use of real estate appraisers and business valuation experts respectively.


   Understanding Market Value  

A company’s market value is a good indication of investors’ perceptions about its business prospects. The range of market values in the marketplace is enormous, ranging from less than $1 million for the smallest companies to hundreds of billions for the world’s biggest and most successful companies.



Market value is determined by the valuations or multiples accorded by investors to companies, such as price-to-sales, price-to-earnings, enterprise value-to-EBITDA, and so on. The higher the valuations, the greater the market value.





Key Takeaways

Market value is the price an asset fetches in the market and is commonly used to refer to market capitalization. ﻿Market values are dynamic in nature because they depend on an assortment of factors, from physical operating conditions to economic climate to the dynamics of demand and supply.






   The Dynamic Nature of Market Values  

Market value can fluctuate a great deal over periods of time and is substantially influenced by the business cycle. Market values plunge during the bear markets that accompany recessions and rise during the bull markets that happen during economic expansions.



Market value is also dependent on numerous other factors, such as the sector in which the company operates, its profitability, debt load, and the broad market environment. For example, Company X and Company B may both have $100 million in annual sales, but if X is a fast-growing technology firm while B is a stodgy retailer, X’s market value will generally be significantly higher than that of Company B.



In the example above, Company X may be trading at a sales multiple of 5, which would give it a market value of $500 million, while Company B may be trading at a sales multiple of 2, which would give it a market value of $200 million.



Market value for a firm may diverge significantly from book value or shareholders’ equity. A stock would generally be considered undervalued if its market value is well below book value, which means the stock is trading at a deep discount to book value per share. This does not imply that a stock is overvalued if it is trading at a premium to book value, as this again depends on the sector and the extent of the premium in relation to the stock’s peers.



The book value is also known as the explicit value, and it can heavily influence a company's implicit value (i.e., the personal perceptions and research of investors and analysts), which in turn affects whether a company's stock price rises or drops.
What Is Market Value Added?  

Market value added (MVA) is a calculation that shows the difference between the market value of a company and the capital contributed by all investors, both bondholders and shareholders. In other words, it is the market value of debt and equity minus all capital claims held against the company. It is calculated as:



MVA = V - K



where MVA is the market value added of the firm, V is the market value of the firm, including the value of the firm's equity and debt (its enterprise value), and K is the total amount of capital invested in the firm.



MVA is closely related to the concept of economic value added (EVA), representing the net present value (NPV) of a series of EVA values.





Key Takeaways

MVAs are representations of value created by the actions and investments of a company's management.A high MVA is evidence that the value of management's actions and investments is greater than the value of the capital contributed by shareholders, whereas a low MVA means just the opposite.MVAs should not be considered a reliable indication of management performance during strong bull markets when stock prices rise in general.

   Understanding Market Value Added (MVA)  

When investors want to look under the hood to see how a company performs for its shareholders, they first look at MVA. A company’s MVA is an indication of its capacity to increase shareholder value over time. A high MVA is evidence of effective management and strong operational capabilities. A low MVA can mean the value of management’s actions and investments is less than the value of the capital contributed by shareholders. A negative MVA means the management's actions and investments have diminished and reversed the value of capital contributed by shareholders.

   MVA Reflects Commitment to Shareholder Value  

Companies with a high MVA are attractive to investors not only because of the greater likelihood they will produce positive returns but also because it is a good indication they have strong leadership and sound governance. MVA can be interpreted as the amount of wealth that management has created for investors over and above their investment in the company.



Companies that are able to sustain or increase MVA over time typically attract more investment, which continues to enhance MVA. The MVA may actually understate the performance of a company because it does not account for cash payouts, such as dividends and stock buybacks, made to shareholders. MVA may not be a reliable indicator of management performance during strong bull markets when stock prices rise in general.


   Examples of MVA  

Companies with high MVA can be found across the investment spectrum.



Alphabet Inc., (GOOGL) the parent of Google, is among the most valuable companies in the world with high growth potential. Its stock returned 1,293% in its first 10 years of operation. While much of its MVA in the early years can be attributed to market exuberance over its shares, the company has managed to more than double it from 2015 to 2019. Alphabet’s MVA has grown from $354.25 billion in 2015 to $606.20 billion in December 2017 to $809.01 billion in December 2019 to $1.19 trillion in 2020.



On the other end of the spectrum is one of the most established companies in the S&P 500 index, the Coca-Cola Company (KO). Coca-Cola is one of Warren Buffett’s favorite stock holdings because its management is so effective at increasing shareholder value. At the end of the year 2019, the company's MVA was $219.66 billion, up from $158.52 billion in 2017 and $150.41 billion in 2015, and that does not include the roughly $6 billion annually in dividend payments to shareholders. As of 2019, Coca-Cola has increased its dividends each year for the last five years by an average of 5.3% per year.
What is Market Value Of Equity?  

Market value of equity is the total dollar value of a company's equity and is also known as market capitalization. This measure of a company's value is calculated by multiplying the current stock price by the total number of outstanding shares. A company's market value of equity is therefore always changing as these two input variables change. It is used to measure a company's size and helps investors diversify their investments across companies of different sizes and different levels of risk.



Investors looking to calculate market value of equity can find the total number of shares outstanding by looking to the equity section of a company's balance sheet.


   Understanding Market Value Of Equity  

A company's market value of equity can be thought of as the total value of the company decided by investors. The market value of equity can shift significantly throughout a trading day, particularly if there are significant news items like earnings. Large companies tend to be more stable in terms of market value of equity owing to the number and diversity of investors they have. Small, thinly-traded companies can easily see double digit shifts in the market value of equity because of a relatively small number of transactions pushing the stock up or down. This is also why small companies can be targets for market manipulation.





Key Takeaways

Market value of equity represents how much investors think a company is worth today.Market value of equity is the same as market capitalization and both are calculated by multiplying the total shares outstanding by the current price per share.Market value of equity changes throughout the trading day as the stock price fluctuates.


   Calculating Market Value of Equity  

Market value of equity is calculated by multiplying the number of shares outstanding by the current share price. For example, on March 28, 2019, Apple stock was trading at $188.72 per share. As of this date, the company's stock buy back program has lowered the shares outstanding from over 6 billion to 4,715,280,000. So the market equity of capitalization is calculated as follows:



Stock Price ($188.72) x Shares Outstanding (4,715,280,000) = $889,867,641,600



For simplicity, people usually quote the above market value of equity as $889.9 billion.


   The Difference Between Market Value of Equity, Enterprise Value and Book Value  

Market value of equity can be compared to other valuations like book value and enterprise value. A company's enterprise value incorporates its market value of equity into the equation along with total debt minus cash and cash equivalents to provide a rough idea of a company's takeover valuation.



The market value of equity is also distinct from the book value of equity. The book value of equity is based on stockholders' equity, which is a line item on the company's balance sheet. A company's market value of equity differs from its book value of equity because the book value of equity focuses on owned assets and owed liabilities. The market value of equity is generally believed to price in some of the company's growth potential beyond its current balance sheet. If the book value is above the market value of equity, however, it may be due to market oversight. This means the company is a potential value buy.


   Market Value of Equity and Market Profile  

In general, there are three different levels of market capitalization, and each level has its own profile. Companies with a market capitalization of less than $2 billion are considered small capitalization, or small caps. Companies with a market capitalization of between $2 billion and $10 billion are considered medium capitalization stocks, also referred to as mid-caps. Companies with a market capitalization over $10 billion are considered large capitalization, or large caps.



Each level has a profile that can help investors gain insights into the behavior of the company. Small caps are generally young companies in the growth stage of development. They are risky, but have higher growth potential. Large caps are mature companies; they may not offer the same growth potential, but they can offer stability. Mid-caps offer a hybrid of the two. By owning stocks in each category, investors ensure a certain amount of diversification in assets, sales, maturity, management, growth rate, growth prospects and market depth.
What Are Marketable Securities  

Marketable securities are liquid financial instruments that can be quickly converted into cash at a reasonable price. The liquidity of marketable securities comes from the fact that the maturities tend to be less than one year, and that the rates at which they can be bought or sold have little effect on prices.





Key Takeaways

Marketable securities are assets that can be liquidated to cash quickly. These short-term liquid securities can be bought or sold on a public stock exchange or a public bond exchange.These securities tend to mature in a year or less and can be either debt or equity. Marketable securities include common stock, Treasury bills, and money market instruments, among others.

   Understanding Marketable Securities  

Businesses typically hold cash in their reserves to prepare them for situations in which they may need to act swiftly, such as taking advantage of an acquisition opportunity that comes up or making contingent payments. However, instead of holding on to all the cash in its coffers which presents no opportunity to earn interest, a business will invest a portion of the cash in short-term liquid securities. This way, instead of having cash sit idly, the company can earn returns on it. If a sudden need for cash emerges, the company can easily liquidate these securities. Examples of a short-term investment products are a group of assets categorized as marketable securities.



Marketable securities are defined as any unrestricted financial instrument that can be bought or sold on a public stock exchange or a public bond exchange. Therefore, marketable securities are classified as either marketable equity security or marketable debt security. Other requirements of marketable securities include having a strong secondary market that can facilitate quick buy and sell transactions, and having a secondary market that provides accurate price quotes for investors. The return on these types of securities is low, due to the fact that marketable securities are highly liquid and are considered safe investments.



Examples of marketable securities include common stock, commercial paper, banker's acceptances, Treasury bills, and other money market instruments.


   Special Considerations  

Marketable securities are evaluated by analysts when conducting liquidity ratio analysis on a company or sector. Liquidity ratios measure a company's ability to meet its short-term financial obligations as they come due. In other words, this ratio assesses whether a company can pay its short-term debts using its most liquid assets. Liquidity ratios include:

​Cash Ratio=Current LiabilitiesMCS​where:MCS=Market Value of Cash and Marketable Securities​﻿



The cash ratio is calculated as the sum of the market value of cash and marketable securities divided by a company's current liabilities. Creditors prefer a ratio above 1 since this means that a firm will be able to cover all its short-term debt if they came due now. However, most companies have a low cash ratio since holding too much cash or investing heavily in marketable securities is not a highly profitable strategy.

​Current Ratio=Current LiabilitiesCurrent Assets​​﻿



The current ratio measures a company's ability to pay off its short-term debts using all its current assets, which includes marketable securities. It is calculated by dividing current assets by current liabilities.

​Quick Ratio=Current LiabilitiesQuick Assets​​﻿



The quick ratio factors in only quick assets into its evaluation of how liquid a company is. Quick assets are defined as securities that can be more easily converted into cash than current assets. Marketable securities are considered quick assets. The formula for the quick ratio is quick assets / current liabilities.


   Types of Marketable Securities  
  Equity Securities  

Marketable equity securities can be either common stock or preferred stock. They are equity securities of a public company held by another corporation and are listed in the balance sheet of the holding company. If the stock is expected to be liquidated or traded within one year, the holding company will list it as a current asset. Conversely, if the company expects to hold the stock for longer than one year, it will list the equity as a non-current asset. All marketable equity securities, both current and non-current, are listed at the lower value of cost or market.



If, however, a company invests in another company's equity in order to acquire or control that company, the securities aren't considered marketable equity securities. The company instead lists them as a long-term investment on its balance sheet.


  Debt Securities  

Marketable debt securities are considered to be any short-term bond issued by a public company held by another company. Marketable debt securities are normally held by a company in lieu of cash, so it's even more important that there is an established secondary market. All marketable debt securities are held at cost on a company's balance sheet as a current asset until a gain or loss is realized upon the sale of the debt instrument.



Marketable debt securities are held as short-term investments and are expected to be sold within one year. If a debt security is expected to be held for longer than one year, it should be classified as a long-term investment on the company's balance sheet.
What Is Marketing?  

Marketing refers to activities a company undertakes to promote the buying or selling of a product or service. Marketing includes advertising, selling, and delivering products to consumers or other businesses. Some marketing is done by affiliates on behalf of a company.



Professionals who work in a corporation's marketing and promotion departments seek to get the attention of key potential audiences through advertising. Promotions are targeted to certain audiences and may involve celebrity endorsements, catchy phrases or slogans, memorable packaging or graphic designs, and overall media exposure.





Key Takeaways

Marketing refers to all activities a company does to promote and sell products or services to consumers.Marketing makes use of the "marketing mix," also known as the four Ps—product, price, place, and promotion.Marketing used to be centered around traditional marketing techniques including television, radio, mail, and word-of-mouth strategies.Though traditional marketing is still prevalent, digital marketing now allows companies to engage in newsletter, social media, affiliate, and content marketing strategies.At its core, marketing seeks to take a product or service, identify its ideal customers, and draw the customers' attention to the product or service available.


   What Is the Goal of Marketing?  

Marketing as a discipline involves all the actions a company undertakes to draw in customers and maintain relationships with them. Networking with potential or past clients is part of the work too and may include writing thank you emails, playing golf with prospective clients, returning calls and emails quickly, and meeting with clients for coffee or a meal.



At its most basic level, marketing seeks to match a company's products and services to customers who want access to those products. Matching products to customers ultimately ensures profitability.





Formal Definition:

"Marketing is the activity, set of institutions, and processes for creating, communicating, delivering, and exchanging offerings that have value for customers, clients, partners, and society at large. "—Official definition from the American Marketing Association, approved 2017.


   What Are the 4 P's of Marketing?  

Product, price, place, and promotion are the Four Ps of marketing. The Four Ps collectively make up the essential mix a company needs to market a product or service. Neil Borden popularized the idea of the marketing mix and the concept of the Four Ps in the 1950s.

  Product  

Product refers to an item or items the business plans to offer to customers. The product should seek to fulfill an absence in the market, or fulfill consumer demand for a greater amount of a product already available. Before they can prepare an appropriate campaign, marketers need to understand what product is being sold, how it stands out from its competitors, whether the product can also be paired with a secondary product or product line, and whether there are substitute products in the market.


  Price  

Price refers to how much the company will sell the product for. When establishing a price, companies must consider the unit cost price, marketing costs, and distribution expenses. Companies must also consider the price of competing products in the marketplace and whether their proposed price point is sufficient to represent a reasonable alternative for consumers.


  Place  

Place refers to the distribution of the product. Key considerations include whether the company will sell the product through a physical storefront, online, or through both distribution channels. When it's sold in a storefront, what kind of physical product placement does it get? When it's sold online, what kind of digital product placement does it get?


  Promotion  

Promotion, the fourth P, is the integrated marketing communications campaign. Promotion includes a variety of activities such as advertising, selling, sales promotions, public relations, direct marketing, sponsorship, and guerrilla marketing.



Promotions vary depending on what stage of the product life cycle the product is in. Marketers understand that consumers associate a product’s price and distribution with its quality, and they take this into account when devising the overall marketing strategy.






Marketing refers to any activities undertaken by a company to promote the buying or selling of a service. If there is a limited quantity of a product, a company may market itself in an attempt to be better positioned as one of the few who get to buy something.


   Types of Marketing Strategies  

Marketing is comprised of an incredibly broad and diverse set of strategies. The industry continues to evolve, and the strategies below may be better suited for some companies over others.


  Traditional Marketing Strategies  

Before technology and the internet, traditional marketing was the primary way companies would market their goods to customers. The main types of traditional marketing strategies includes:



Outdoor Marketing: This entails public displays of advertising external to a consumer's house. This includes billboards, printed advertisements on benches, sticker wraps on vehicles, or advertisements on public transit.
Print Marketing: This entails small, easily printed content that is easy to replicate. Traditionally, companies often mass produced printed materials, as the printed content was the same for all customers. Today, more flexibility in printing processes means that materials can be differentiated.
Direct Marketing: This entails specific content delivered to potential customers. Some print marketing content could be mailed. Otherwise, direct marketing mediums could include coupons, vouchers for free goods, or pamphlets.
Electronic Marketing: This entails use of TV and radio for advertising. Though short bursts of digital content, a company can convey information to a customer through visual or auditory media that may grab a viewer's attention better than a printed form above.
Event Marketing: This entails attempting to gather potential customers at a specific location for the opportunity to speak with them about products or demonstrate products. This includes conferences, trade shows, seminars, roadshows, or private events.


  Digital Marketing  

The marketing industry has been forever changed with the introduction of digital marketing. From the early days of pop-up ads to targeted placements based on viewing history, there are now innovating ways companies can reach customers through digital marketing.



Search Engine Marketing: This entails companies attempting to increase search traffic through two ways. First, companies can pay search engines for placement on result pages. Second, companies can emphasize search engine optimization (SEO) techniques to organically place highly on search results.
E-mail Marketing: This entails companies obtaining customer or potential customer e-mail addresses and distributing messages or newsletters. These messages can include coupons, discount opportunities, or advance notice of upcoming sales.
Social Media Marketing: This entails building an online presence on specific social media platforms. Like search engine marketing, companies can place paid advertisements to bypass algorithms and obtain a higher chance of being seen by viewers. Otherwise, a company can attempt to organically grow by posting content, interacting with followers, or uploading media like photos and videos.
Affiliate Marketing: This entails using third-party advertising to drive customer interest. Often, an affiliate that will get a commission from a sale will do affiliate marketing as the third-party is incentivized to drive a sale for a good that is not their own original product.
Content Marketing: This entails creating content, whether eBooks, infographics, video seminars, or other downloadable content. The goal is to create a product (often free) to share information about a product, obtain customer information, and encourage customers to continue with the company beyond the content.






In 1978, Gary Thuerk sent a message to roughly 400 people using ARPANET, the first public packet-switched computer network. With that message, the first ever recorded spam e-mail message had been sent.


   What Are the Benefits of Marketing?  

Well-defined marketing strategies can benefit a company in several ways. It may be challenging in developing the right strategy or executing the plan; when done well, marketing can yield the following results:



Audience Generation. Marketing allows a company to target specific people it believes will benefit from its product or service. Sometimes, people know they have the need. Other times, they don't realize it. Marketing enables a company to connect with a cohort of people that fit the demographic of who the company aims to serve.
Inward Education. Marketing is useful for collecting information to be processed internally to drive success. For example, consider market research that finds a certain product is primarily purchased by women aged 18-34 years old. By collecting this information, a company can better understand how to cater to this demographic, drive sales, and be more efficient with resources.
Outward Education. Marketing can also be used to communicate with the world what your company does, what products you sell, and how your company can enrich the lives of others. Campaigns can be educational, informing those outside of your company why they need your product. In addition, marketing campaigns let a company introduce itself, its history, its owners, and its motivation for being the company it is.
Brand Creation. Marketing allows for a company to take an offensive approach to creating a brand. Instead of a customer shaping their opinion of a company based on their interactions, a company can preemptively engage a customer with specific content or media to drive certain emotions or reactions. This allows a company to shape its image before the customer has ever interacted with its products.
Long-lasting. Marketing campaigns done right can have a long-lasting impact on customers. Consider Poppin' Fresh, also known as the Pillsbury Doughboy. First appearing in 1965, the mascot has helped create a long-lasting, warm, friendly brand for Pillsbury.
Financial Performance. The ultimate goal and benefit of marketing is to drive sales. When relationships with customers are stronger, well-defined, and positive, customers are more likely to engage in sales. When marketing is done right, customers turn to your company, and you gain a competitive advantage over your competitors. Even if both products are exactly the same, marketing can create that competitive advantage for why a client picks you over someone else.






According to MarTech, a digital marketing provider, the world will spend $4.7 trillion on marketing by 2025. This estimate includes an increase of $1.1 trillion from 2021 to 2025.


   What Are the Limitations of Marketing?  

Though there are many reasons a company embarks on marketing campaigns, there are several limitations to the industry.



Oversaturation. Every company wants customers to buy its product and not its competitors. Therefore, marketing channels can be competitive as companies strive to garner more positive attention and recognition. If too many companies are competing, a customer's attention may be strongly diluted, resulting in any form of advertising not being effective.
Devaluation. When a company promotes a price discount or sale, the public may psychologically eventually see that product as worth less in the future. If a campaign is so strong, customers may even wait to purchase a good knowing or remembering what the sale price was from before. For example, some may intentionally hold off buying goods if Black Friday is approaching.
No Guaranteed Success. Marketing campaigns may incur upfront expenses that hold no promise of future success. This is also true of market research studies, where time, effort, and resources are poured into a study that may yield no usable or helpful results.
Customer Bias. Loyal, long-time customers need no enticing to buy a company's brand or product. However, newer, uninitiated customers may. Marketing naturally is biased towards non-loyal patrons as those who already support the company would be better served by further investment in product improvement.
Cost. Marketing campaigns may be expensive. Digital marketing campaigns may be labor-intensive to set up and costly to maintain the scheduling, implementation, and execution of the plan. Don't forget about the headlines that promote Super Bowl commercial expenses in the millions.
Economy-Dependent. Marketing is most successful when people have capital to spend. Though marketing can create non-financial benefits such as brand loyalty and product recognition, the ultimate goal is to drive sales. During unfavorable macroeconomic conditions when unemployment is high or recession concerns are elevated, consumers may be less like to spend no matter how great a market campaign may be.




What Is Marketing?
Marketing is a division of a company, product line, individual, or entity that promotes its service. Marketing attempts to encourage market participants to buy their product and commit loyalty to a specific company.




Why Is Marketing So Important?
Marketing is important for a few reasons. First, marketing campaigns may be the first time a customer interacts or is exposed to a company's product. A company has the opportunity to educate, promote, and encourage potential buyers. Marketing also helps shape the brand image a company wants to convey. For example, an outdoor camping gear company that wants to be known for its rugged, tough goods can embark on specific campaigns that embody these traits and make these emotions memorable to prospective customers.




What Is the Purpose of Marketing?
An important goal of marketing is propelling a company’s growth. This can be seen through attracting and retaining new customers.  Companies may apply a number of different marketing strategies to achieve these goals. For instance, matching products with customers' needs could involve personalization, prediction, and essentially knowing the right problem to solve.  Another strategy is creating value through the customer experience. This is demonstrated through efforts to elevate customer satisfaction and remove any difficulties with the product or service.




What Are the 4 Ps of Marketing?
A commonly used concept in the marketing field, the Four Ps of marketing looks at four key elements of a marketing strategy. The Four Ps consist of product, price, place, and promotion. 




What Are the Types of Marketing?
There are dozens of types of marketing, and the types have proliferated with the introduction and rise of social media, mobile platforms, and technological advancements. Before technology, marketing might have been geared towards mail campaigns, word-of-mouth campaigns, billboards, delivery of sample products, TV commercials, or telemarketing. Now, marketing encompasses social media, targeted ads, e-mail marketing, inbound marketing to attract web traffic, and more.
What Is a Marketing Campaign?  

Marketing campaigns promote products through different types of media, such as television, radio, print, and online platforms. Campaigns are not solely reliant on advertising and can include demonstrations, video conferencing, and other interactive techniques. Businesses operating in highly competitive markets and franchisees may initiate frequent marketing campaigns and devote significant resources to generating brand awareness and sales.





Key Takeaways

Marketing campaigns promote products through different types of media, such as television, radio, print, and online platforms.Defining a campaign's goal usually dictates how much marketing is needed and what media are most effective for reaching a specific segment of consumers.﻿Companies that lose sales due to major negative press often use marketing campaigns to rehabilitate their image.


   Understanding Marketing Campaigns  

Marketing campaigns can be designed with different goals in mind, including building a brand image, introducing a new product, increasing sales of a product already on the market, or even reducing the impact of negative news. Defining a campaign's goal usually dictates how much marketing is needed and what media are most effective for reaching a specific segment of the population.






Businesses operating in highly competitive markets may initiate frequent marketing campaigns and devote significant resources to generating brand awareness and sales.


   Types of Marketing Campaign Activities  

There are many ways to market products and services to customers, from mailing brochures to coordinating a social media blitz. Small companies can email invitations to a special sale and offer a free product to every customer who brings the invitation. Larger companies can use paid advertising and professional agencies to reach a wider audience.



Whatever the size of the company, it's important that someone is dedicated to handling the influx of traffic a marketing campaign generates. If you are prompting customers to sign up for your email list, you must make sure that the list is managed well and that new customers receive welcoming messages. If visits to your website increase, you must continually update your content to convert this traffic to profitable sales.



Companies that lose sales due to major negative press often use marketing campaigns to rehabilitate their image. One example is Chipotle Mexican Grill, which was investigated by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention after dozens of customers became sick in 2015 from food safety issues related to E. coli and norovirus. Chipotle's sales dropped 30% in the first quarter of 2016, and to regain customer interest, the company offered coupons for free food via direct mail and texts. Chipotle also used online video to announce a $10 million grant to support local farmers.


   Examples of Successful Marketing Campaigns  

The long-running Aflac duck campaign is one example of a campaign that significantly raised brand recognition. The company's brand-recognition rate was just 12% when it launched the campaign in 2000, and more than a decade of advertising boosted recognition to 90%.﻿﻿



Lay's launched its first "Do Us a Flavor" campaign in 2012, asking customers to suggest new potato-chip flavors through texts and social media. The company's sales increased 12%, and its volume of social media followers tripled.﻿﻿
What Is a Marketing Mix?  

A marketing mix includes multiple areas of focus as part of a comprehensive marketing plan. The term often refers to a common classification that began as the four Ps: product, price, placement, and promotion.



Effective marketing touches on a broad range of areas as opposed to fixating on one message. Doing so helps reach a wider audience, and by keeping the four Ps in mind, marketing professionals are better able to maintain focus on the things that really matter. Focusing on a marketing mix helps organizations make strategic decisions when launching new products or revising existing products.

Key Takeaways

A marketing mix refers to a framework that uses the four Ps of product, price, placement, and promotion.This concept traces back to 1960, when marketing professor E. Jerome McCarthy first published it in a book entitled Basic Marketing: A Managerial Approach.The different elements of a marketing mix work in conjunction with one another with the ultimate purpose of generating higher sales.In addition to the 4 Ps, three approaches can also be integrated that include people, process, and physical evidence to reinforce a consumer-centric type of marketing strategy.This type of strategy extends beyond a product-focused marketing approach.


   What Are the 4 Ps of a Marketing Mix?  

The four Ps classification for developing an effective marketing strategy was first introduced in 1960 by marketing professor and author E. Jerome McCarthy. It was published in the book entitled Basic Marketing: A Managerial Approach. Depending on the industry and the target of the marketing plan, marketing managers may take various approaches to each of the four Ps. Each element can be examined independently, but in practice, they often are dependent on one another. 


  Product  

This represents an item or service designed to satisfy customer needs and wants. To effectively market a product or service, it's important to identify what differentiates it from competing products or services. It's also important to determine if other products or services can be marketed in conjunction with it.


  Price  

The sale price of the product reflects what consumers are willing to pay for it. Marketing professionals need to consider costs related to research and development, manufacturing, marketing, and distribution—otherwise known as cost-based pricing. Pricing based primarily on consumers' perceived quality or value is known as value-based pricing.






Value-based pricing plays a key role in products that are considered to be status symbols.


  Placement  

When determining areas of distribution, it's important to consider the type of product sold. Basic consumer products, such as paper goods, often are readily available in many stores. Premium consumer products, however, typically are available only in select stores.


  Promotion  

Joint marketing campaigns are called a promotional mix. Activities might include advertising, sales promotion, personal selling, and public relations. One key consideration is the budget assigned to the marketing mix. Marketing professionals carefully construct a message that often incorporates details from the other three Ps when trying to reach their target audience. Determination of the best mediums to communicate the message and decisions about the frequency of the communication also are important.


   What Are Other Marketing Tools?  

Not all marketing is product-focused. Customer service businesses are fundamentally different than those based primarily on physical products, so they often will take a consumer-centric approach that incorporates additional elements to address their unique needs.



Three additional Ps tied to this type of marketing mix might include people, process, and physical evidence. "People" refers to employees who represent a company as they interact with clients or customers. "Process" represents the method or flow of providing service to clients and often incorporates monitoring service performance for customer satisfaction. "Physical evidence" relates to an area or space where company representatives and customers interact. Marketers take into consideration elements such as furniture, signage, and layout.



Additionally, marketers often study consumers in order to refine or update strategies related to services or products. This requires a strategy for communicating with consumers in order to obtain feedback and define the type of feedback being sought.



Traditionally, marketing commences with identifying consumers' needs and ceases with the delivery and promotion of a final product or service. Consumer-centric marketing is more cyclical. Its goals include reassessing customers' needs, communicating frequently, and developing strategies to build customer loyalty.




What Are the Four Elements of a Marketing Mix?
The four primary elements of a marketing mix are product, price, placement, and promotion. This framework aims to create a comprehensive plan to distinguish a product or service from competitors that creates value for the customer. Often, these elements are dependent on each other.Product refers to a good or service that meets a customer's needs. Here, companies focus on features that differentiate it from its competitors. An organization may also consider complementary products that fit within its suite of product or service offerings.Price represents the price point or price range for the product or service. Ultimately, the goal is to maximize profit margins and return on investment while considering the price that customers are willing to pay.Placement refers to distribution channels. Specifically, where is this product being promoted, and how can you get it in front of your target audience?Promotion focuses on creating brand awareness around your product or service. Importantly, it looks at how utilizing certain channels can drive sales.




What Are the 7 Ps in a Marketing Mix?
Sometimes, the marketing mix can extend beyond the classic four Ps of product, price, placement, and promotion established by professor E. Jerome McCarthy in 1960. These additional categories include people, physical evidence, and process.In this way, people represent the employees who interact with customers. A company may consider company culture as it relates to its brand strategy. This may include customer relationship management (CRM), which aims to increase brand loyalty among customers.Physical evidence might include the packaging or the layout of a physical store, which can reinforce a brand and create more value to the customer.Finally, the process identifies areas, often from a logistical standpoint, that enable the customer to have the most seamless experience possible with a product or service. This may include everything from delivery logistics and shipping to managing third-party retailers.




What Is the Purpose of a Marketing Mix?
At its core, a marketing mix is focused on promoting a product or service to generate revenue for a company. On the whole, it integrates key marketing strategies that create brand awareness, build customer loyalty, and drive product sales.


   The Bottom Line  

The development of a comprehensive, effective marketing plan takes into consideration a marketing mix that includes several areas of focus. Typically, the marketing mix refers to the four Ps: product or service, its price, placement, and promotion. This concept was developed in 1960, when marketing professor E. Jerome McCarthy first published it in a book entitled Basic Marketing: A Managerial Approach.



However, because not all marketing is focused on products, customer-service businesses rely on other marketing tools that might include three additional Ps: the people who interact with customers, the process that creates a seamless customer experience, and physical evidence, or the area where customers and company representatives interact.



All of these tools are used to promote a product or service and build brand awareness and customer loyalty in order to generate revenue for a business.
What Is a Marketing Plan?  

A marketing plan is an operational document that outlines an advertising strategy that an organization will implement to generate leads and reach its target market. A marketing plan details the outreach and PR campaigns to be undertaken over a period, including how the company will measure the effect of these initiatives. The functions and components of a marketing plan include the following:



Market research to support pricing decisions and new market entries
Tailored messaging that targets certain demographics and geographic areas
Platform selection for product and service promotion: digital, radio, Internet, trade magazines, and the mix of those platforms for each campaign
Metrics that measure the results of marketing efforts and their reporting timelines



A marketing plan is based on a company’s overall marketing strategy.





Key Takeaways

The marketing plan details the strategy that a company will use to market its products to customers.The plan identifies the target market, the value proposition of the brand or the product, the campaigns to be initiated, and the metrics to be used to assess the effectiveness of marketing initiatives.The marketing plan should be adjusted on an ongoing basis based on the findings from the metrics that show which efforts are having an impact and which are not.Digital marketing shows results in near real-time, whereas TV ads require rotation to realize any level of market penetration.A marketing plan is part of a business plan, which describes all of the important aspects of a business, such as its goals, values, mission statement, budget, and strategies.


   Understanding Marketing Plans  

The terms marketing plan and marketing strategy are often used interchangeably because a marketing plan is developed based on an overarching strategic framework. In some cases, the strategy and the plan may be incorporated into one document, particularly for smaller companies that may only run one or two major campaigns in a year. The plan outlines marketing activities on a monthly, quarterly, or annual basis while the marketing strategy outlines the overall value proposition.


   Types of Marketing Plans  

There are a variety of different marketing plans that suit different businesses and different business needs.



New Product Launch: This is a marketing plan that outlines how a new product will enter the market, who it will target, and in what way advertising will be done.



Social Media: A social media marketing plan focuses on the advertising strategies on different social media platforms and how to engage with the users on these platforms.



Time-Based: Time-based marketing plans, such as those that are executed quarterly or annually, focus on the time of the year, the current condition of the business, and the best strategies in that period.


   How to Write a Marketing Plan  
  Mission and Value Proposition  

A marketing plan considers the value proposition of a business. The value proposition is the overall promise of value to be delivered to the customer and is a statement that appears front and center of the company website or any branding materials.



The value proposition should state how a product or brand solves the customer's problem, the benefits of the product or brand, and why the customer should buy from this company and not another. The marketing plan is based on this value proposition to the customer.


  Set KPIs  

Establishing your key performance indicators (KPIs) will allow you to measure the success of your marketing plan in relation to your company's value proposition. For example, if your goal is to engage with a certain demographic in a certain region, you can track social media and website visits.





Fast Fact

The most effective digital marketing techniques in 2020 according to marketers are content marketing and marketing automation.


  Identify Your Target Market  

The marketing plan identifies the target market for a product or brand. Market research is often the basis for a target market and marketing channel decisions. For example, whether the company will advertise on the radio, on social media, through online ads, or on regional TV. 



Knowing who you want to sell to and why is an extremely critical component of any business plan. It allows you to focus your business and measure its success. Different demographics have different tastes and needs, knowing what your target market is will help you market to them.


  Strategy and Execution  

The marketing plan includes the rationale for these decisions. The plan should focus on the creation, timing, and placement of specific campaigns and include the metrics that will measure the outcomes of marketing efforts. For example, will you advertise on the radio or on social media? What time will you air advertisements if they are on the radio or TV?


  Set Your Budget  

A marketing plan costs money. Knowing your budget for a marketing plan will allow you to create a suitable plan within that context, stick to it, and prevent runaway costs. It will also help you allocate to different areas of your marketing plan.


  Adjust Your Plan  

A marketing plan can be adjusted at any point based on the results from the metrics. If digital ads are performing better than expected, for example, the budget for a campaign can be adjusted to fund a higher-performing platform or the company can initiate a new budget. The challenge for marketing leaders is to ensure that every platform has sufficient time to show results.






Without the correct metrics to assess the impact of outreach and marketing efforts, an organization will not know which campaigns to repeat and which ones to drop; maintaining ineffective initiatives will unnecessarily increase marketing costs.



Digital marketing shows results in near real-time, whereas TV ads require rotation to realize any level of market penetration. In the traditional marketing mix model, a marketing plan would fall under the category of "promotion," which is one of the four Ps, a term coined by Neil Borden to describe the marketing mix of product, price, promotion, and place.


   Marketing Plan vs. Business Plan  

A business plan details how a business will operate and function in its entirety. A business plan is a roadmap for a business. It will cover the goals, missions, values, financials, and strategies that the business will use in day-to-day operations and in the achievement of its objectives.



A business plan will include an executive summary, the products and services sold, a marketing analysis, a marketing strategy, financial planning, and a budget, to name but a few items.



As mentioned, a business plan will include a marketing plan, which focuses on creating a marketing strategy on how to bring awareness to the public of the company's product or service, how to reach the target market, and generate sales.


   Example of a Marketing Plan  

John came up with a new business idea that he believes is a niche offering in the market. He decides to start a business and his first step is creating a business plan that outlines all of the objectives, goals, values, pitfalls, and finances of his company.



John is able to raise enough capital from friends and family to get started, hires a few employees, and eventually creates his product. He now has to start selling his product and generate sales to keep his business operating.



To achieve this, John, with the help of a marketing company, creates a marketing plan. The marketing plan consists of market research that details the target market for John's product, which is recently retired men.



The marketing plan then comes up with the best methods of reaching this target market. The marketing plan stresses radio and television as opposed to social media as older, retired men use social media less than traditional forms of media, according to the market research that was conducted.



The ads are tailored to the target market, showing how John's product will benefit their lives, particularly when compared to market alternatives. Once the marketing plan has been executed, the marketing team analyzes how the efforts translate into sales.




What Is a Marketing Plan Template?
A marketing plan template is a document that an individual can use to create a marketing plan. The marketing plan template will contain all the important elements and the various needed language with blank sections. A user can insert their own information related to their business in the blank sections to ultimately create their own marketing plan.




What Is an Executive Summary in a Marketing Plan?
The executive summary of a marketing plan provides a brief overview of the entire marketing plan. The executive summary will contain the key findings of the market research, the company's objectives, marketing goals, an overview of the marketing trends, the description of the product or service being marketed, information on the target market, and how to financially plan for the marketing plan.




What Is a Top-Down Marketing Strategy?
A top-down marketing strategy is a traditional marketing strategy. This is where a business determines who it should sell to and how, and the customer base is largely passive and spurred to take action once they hear the advertisement. For example, a top-down marketing strategy would include ads on radio or television. Top-down marketing strategies are usually determined by the executives of a firm. It usually consists of what a firm desires to do and then determining a way to do it.




What Is a Bottom-Up Marketing Strategy?
A bottom-up marketing strategy focuses on discovering a workable strategy and then building on that strategy to create an impactful advertising campaign. Today's consumer wants to relate to a product or service in a meaningful way and a bottom-up marketing strategy is better suited to this. A bottom-up marketing strategy should focus on the target market and how better to create value for them.




How Much Does a Marketing Plan Cost?
The cost of a marketing plan will vary based on the company, the complexity, and the length of the overall strategy. The cost can range anywhere from $10,000 to $40,000.


   The Bottom Line  

A marketing plan is the advertising strategy that a business will implement to sell its product or service. The marketing plan will help determine who the target market is, how best to reach them, at what price point the product or service should be sold, and how the company will measure its efforts.



Constantly monitoring and adjusting a market plan is an important part of running a business as it shows what are the best and worst ways to generate sales. Without a successful marketing plan, a business may not be able to continue operating for very long.
What Is a Marketing Strategy?  

A marketing strategy refers to a business’s overall game plan for reaching prospective consumers and turning them into customers of their products or services. A marketing strategy contains the company’s value proposition, key brand messaging, data on target customer demographics, and other high-level elements.



A thorough marketing strategy covers the four Ps of marketing: product, price, place, and promotion.





Key Takeaways

A marketing strategy is a business’s game plan for reaching prospective consumers and turning them into customers of their products or services.Marketing strategies should revolve around a company’s value proposition.The ultimate goal of a marketing strategy is to achieve and communicate a sustainable competitive advantage over rival companies.


   Understanding Marketing Strategies  

A clear marketing strategy should revolve around the company’s value proposition, which communicates to consumers what the company stands for, how it operates, and why it deserves their business.



This provides marketing teams with a template that should inform their initiatives across all of the company’s products and services. For example, Walmart (WMT) is widely known as a discount retailer with “everyday low prices,” whose business operations and marketing efforts are rooted in that idea.


   Marketing Strategies vs. Marketing Plans  

The marketing strategy is outlined in the marketing plan—a document that details the specific types of marketing activities that a company conducts and contains timetables for rolling out various marketing initiatives.



Marketing strategies should ideally have longer life spans than individual marketing plans because they contain value propositions and other key elements of a company’s brand, which generally hold constant over the long haul. In other words, marketing strategies cover big-picture messaging, while marketing plans delineate the logistical details of specific campaigns.



For example, a marketing strategy might say that a company aims to increase authority in niche circles where their clients visit. The marketing plan puts that in action by commissioning thought leadership pieces on LinkedIn.


   Benefits of a Marketing Strategy  

The ultimate goal of a marketing strategy is to achieve and communicate a sustainable competitive advantage over rival companies by understanding the needs and wants of its consumers. Whether it’s a print ad design, mass customization, or a social media campaign, a marketing asset can be judged based on how effectively it communicates a company’s core value proposition.



Market research can help chart the efficacy of a given campaign and can help identify untapped audiences to achieve bottom-line goals and increase sales.


   How to Create a Marketing Strategy  

Creating a marketing strategy requires a few steps. HubSpot, a digital marketing resource, offers insight into how to create your strategy.



Identify your goals: While sales are the ultimate goal for every company, you should have more short-term goals such as establishing authority, increasing customer engagement, or generating leads. These smaller goals offer measurable benchmarks for the progress of your marketing plan. Think of strategy as the high-level ideology and planning as how you accomplish your goals.Know your clients: Every product or service has an ideal customer, and you should know who they are and where they hang out. If you sell power tools, you’ll choose marketing channels where general contractors may see your messaging. Establish who your client is and how your product will improve their lives.Create your message: Now that you know your goals and who you’re pitching to, it’s time to create your messaging. This is your opportunity to show your potential clients how your product or service will benefit them and why you’re the only company that can provide it.Define your budget: How you disperse your messaging may depend on how much you can afford. Will you be purchasing advertising? Hoping for a viral moment on social media organically? Sending out press releases to the media to try to gain coverage? Your budget will dictate what you can afford to do.Determine your channels: Even the best message needs the appropriate venue. Some companies may find more value in creating blog posts for their website. Others may find success with paid ads on social media channels. Find the most appropriate venue for your content.Measure your success: To target your marketing, you need to know whether it is reaching its audience. Determine your metrics and how you’ll judge the success of your marketing efforts.




Why does my company need a marketing strategy?
A marketing strategy helps a company direct its advertising dollars to where it will have the most impact. Compared with the data from 2018, the correlation between organization and success in marketers jumped from being almost four times more likely to almost seven times more likely in 2022.




What do the four Ps mean in a marketing strategy?
The four Ps are product, price, promotion, and place. These are the key factors that are involved in the marketing of a good or service. The four Ps can be used when planning a new business venture, evaluating an existing offer, or trying to optimize sales with a target audience. It also can be used to test a current marketing strategy on a new audience.




What does a marketing strategy look like?

Is a marketing strategy the same as a marketing plan?
The terms “marketing plan” and “marketing strategy” are often used interchangeably because a marketing plan is developed based on an overarching strategic framework. In some cases, the strategy and the plan may be incorporated into one document, particularly for smaller companies that may only run one or two major campaigns in a year. The plan outlines marketing activities on a monthly, quarterly, or annual basis, while the marketing strategy outlines the overall value proposition.
What Is the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID)?  

The Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID) is a European regulation that increases the transparency across the European Union's financial markets and standardizes the regulatory disclosures required for firms operating there.



MiFID implemented new measures, such as pre- and post-trade transparency requirements, and set out the standards of conduct to be followed by financial firms. MiFID has a defined scope that primarily focuses on stocks. The directive was drafted in 2004 and has been in force across the European Union (EU) since 2007. MiFID was replaced by MiFID II in 2018.





Key Takeaways

The goal of the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID) is to increase transparency across EU financial markets and to standardize regulatory disclosures for firms.MiFID is part of the regulatory changes sweeping the EU that impact all financial firms' compliance departments.MiFID has been in force across the European Union since 2007.MiFID was replaced by an updated regulatory directive, MiFID II, in 2018.Stocks are the primary focus of MiFID, but the product scope has been expanded under MiFID II and more recent amendments.


   Understanding the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID)  

The stated aim of MiFID is for all EU members to share a common, robust regulatory framework that protects investors. MiFID came into effect a year before the 2008 financial crisis, but changes were made following it that took shape in MiFID II. One issue in the original drafts was that the regulatory approach in dealing with countries outside of the European Union was left up to each member state. This meant that some firms outside of the EU could have a competitive advantage over firms inside the union because of the easier regulatory oversight.



This issue was addressed through MiFID II (implemented in January 2018), which harmonized the rules for all firms with EU clients. MiFID focused primarily on stocks, which was seen as a limitation because it did not include the vast amount of financial products available in the market, such as over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives.



OTC transactions are done between two parties without any exchange in the middle to act as a supervisor. As a result, there was less regulatory oversight and transparency for the parties engaging in an OTC trade. Implementing MiFID II brought many more financial products under its purview. The Markets in Financial Instruments Regulation (MiFIR) works in conjunction with MiFID and MiFID II as a regulation rather than a directive to extend the codes of conduct beyond stocks to other types of assets.






The European Union began enforcing the Markets in Crypto-Asset Regulation (MiCA) in July 2023, which complements the 2022 MiFID II amendment that added crypto-assets, Regulation 2022/858.


   Client Classifications Under the MiFID  

One of the key aspects of MiFID is the classification of clients into specific client types. There are three client types: professional clients, retail clients, and eligible counterparties. The goal for the classifications is that the regulatory protection for the clients should reflect the different levels of risks for each client type.



The idea is that different types of clients, or investors, will have different levels of financial knowledge and should be given different levels of protection when dealing with a financial body, such as a bank. Eligible counterparties are provided the least protection, and retail clients are provided the highest.



Depending on the client type, they are provided with different levels of information necessary for their understanding of the specific risks, overall explanations, and details of that transaction.


   European Union Regulatory Harmonization  

MiFID is just one part of the regulatory changes sweeping the EU and impacting the financial firms' compliance departments, e.g., insurers, mutual fund providers, and banks operating there. Taken together with other regulatory initiatives, like the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and MiFIR, the EU is following through on its vision of a transparent market with clear rights and protections for EU citizens. 



As with any regulatory framework, many rules are tweaks to existing regulations, such as the requirements for disclosure where a conflict of interest exists. However, several best practices, like appointing a single officer to protect client interests from inside the firm, are now explicit requirements for firms that want to access the EU market.


   MiFID II  

In 2018, the European Commission enacted a revised directive called MiFID II. First proposed in 2012, the revised directive was intended to restore confidence in the markets following the 2008 market crash.



While MiFID was limited to equity stocks, MiFID II extended the requirements to issuers of all types of securities, including debt securities, derivatives, and structured instruments. The new regulation enhanced the transparency and reporting requirements of securities trades, reducing the use of dark pools and OTC trading. It also extended investor protection for all types of securities trades, whether the investor was located inside or outside of the European Union.



In 2022, MiFID II was amended to include tokenized securities, crypto-assets, and other distributed ledger-based instruments.




How Did MiFID II Affect Investment Banks?
For banks that provide asset management or investment services, MiFID II requires financial instruments to be traded only in multilateral and regulated trading platforms, or those that adhere to the transparency requirements of OTC trading. These rules are intended to protect investors and eliminate dark trading of securities.




What Is the Difference Between MiFID and MiFID II?
MiFID II enhanced the transparency and reporting requirements of the older MiFID regulation. One key difference is the expansion of its scope: while MiFID applied largely to equities markets, MiFID II applies to all types of securities and derivatives.




How Does Brexit Affect MiFID II?
After the United Kingdom left the European Union, the two economies had two substantially similar regulatory regimes, but they lost their ability to trade easily. British firms lost their license to provide financial services to EU clients and vice versa. It also created duplicate reporting requirements for the two areas.


   The Bottom Line  

MiFID, or the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive, was a set of European regulations governing equities markets in the European Union. It was intended to enhance transparency and reporting requirements to protect European investors. These rules were replaced by the revised MiFID II regulation in 2018 and the amendment of 2022.
What Is a Markup?  

A markup is the difference between an investment's lowest current offering price among broker-dealers and the price charged to the customer for said investment. Markups occur when brokers act as principals, buying and selling securities from their own accounts at their own risk rather than receiving a fee for facilitating a transaction. Most dealers are brokers, and vice versa, and so the term broker-dealer is common.



Markups also appear in retail settings, where retailers mark-up the selling price of merchandise by a certain amount or percentage in order to earn a profit. A pricing method whereby a retailer establishes a selling price by adding a markup to total variable costs is called the variable cost-plus pricing method.





Key Takeaways

A markup is the difference between the market price of a security personally held by a broker-dealer and the price paid by a customer.Markups are a legitimate way for broker-dealers to make a profit on the sale of securities.Dealers, however, are not always required to disclose the markup to customers.In retail settings, markups occur when retailers increase the selling price of merchandise by a certain amount or percentage in order to earn a profit.


   Understanding Markups  

Markups occur when certain marketable securities are available for purchase by retail investors from dealers who sell the securities directly from their own accounts. The dealer's only compensation comes in the form of the markup, the difference between the security's purchase price and the price the dealer charges to the retail investor. The dealer assumes some risk as the market price of the security could drop before being sold to investors.



In business, the markup is the price spread between the cost to produce a good or service and its selling price. In order to ensure a profit and recover the costs to create a product or service, producers must add a markup to their total costs. They will express the markup as either a fixed amount or a percentage over the cost.


   Markups vs. Markdowns  

A markdown, on the other hand, occurs when a broker purchases a security from a customer at a price lower than its market value. Markdowns also occur when a dealer charges a customer a lower price for a security than the current bid price among dealers. Dealers might offer lower prices to customers in order to stimulate additional buying, which will offset their initial losses by earning them extra commissions.



For retailers, a price markdown is a deliberate reduction in the selling price of a good. There are several reasons why a retailer may decide to markdown its goods. For seasonal merchandise, the retailer may be eager to clear the shelves of old merchandise to make room for the next season's goods. They may slash prices to do so, even if it means they take a loss on the sale. Some manufacturers may come out with new models of products each year or every few years, in which case they will offer markdowns on older products rather than risk being stuck with obsolete inventory.


   Benefits of Markups  

Markups are a legitimate way for broker-dealers to make a profit on the sale of securities. Securities, such as bonds, bought or sold on the market are offered with a spread. The spread is determined by the bid price, what someone is willing to pay for the bonds, and the ask price, which is what someone is willing to accept for the bonds.



When a dealer acts a principal in the transaction, he can mark up the bid price, which creates a wider bid-ask spread. The difference between the market spread and the dealer’s marked-up spread is the profit.






In lieu of charging a flat fee, brokers acting as principals can be compensated from the markup (gross profits) of securities held and later sold to customers.


   Special Considerations for Markups  

The dealer is only required to disclose the transaction fee, which is typically a nominal cost. In doing so, the buyer isn’t privy to the dealer’s original transaction or the markup. From the buyer’s perspective, the only cost for the bond purchase is the small transaction fee. Should bond buyers try to immediately sell the bonds on the open market, they would have to make up the dealer’s markup on the spread or incur a loss. The lack of transparency places the burden on the bond buyers to determine whether they are receiving a fair deal.



Dealers compete with each other by reducing the amount of their markups. It is possible for bond buyers to compare the price the dealer paid for the bond with its actual price. Bond buyers can have access to bond transaction details through various sources, such as Investinginbonds.com, which reports all information related to bond transactions daily.
What Is Married Filing Jointly?  

Married filing jointly is a filing status for married couples, allowing them to file joint tax returns. When filing taxes under married filing jointly status, a married couple can record their respective incomes, deductions, credits, and exemptions on the same tax return.



Married filing jointly is often the best choice when only one spouse has an income or the most significant income; however, if both spouses work and the income and itemized deductions are large and very unequal, it may be more advantageous to file separately.





Key Takeaways

Married filing jointly is an income tax filing status available to any couple who has wed as of December 31 of the tax year.Taxpayers are required to choose one tax filing status by checking off the appropriate box at the top of the first page of Form 1040.This tax filing status is often the best choice when one spouse earns significantly more money than the other.Married filing jointly allows a couple to use only one tax return.Both spouses are equally responsible for the return and any taxes and penalties owed.


   How Married Filing Jointly Works  

Taxpayers are required to indicate their tax filing status on the top of the first page of From 1040 by checking off the appropriate box. The options include:



SingleMarried filing jointlyMarried filing separatelyHead of householdQualifying surviving spouse 



Married couples filing jointly generally have access to more tax benefits. When using the married filing jointly filing status, both spouses are equally responsible for the return and the taxes. If either one of the spouses understates the taxes due, both are equally liable for the penalties, unless the other spouse can prove they were unaware of the mistake and did not benefit from it.


   Married Filing Jointly vs. Married Filing Separately  

When using married filing jointly status, your total combined tax liability is often lower than the sum of your and your spouse’s individual tax liabilities if you were filing separately. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) encourages couples to file together by offering them various tax benefits that don’t apply to other filing statuses.



Couples who file together qualify for multiple tax credits, including the:



Earned Income Credit (EIC)
child and dependent care credit
American opportunity tax credit (AOTC)
lifetime learning credit (LLC)
saver's tax credit



A joint tax return often provides a bigger tax refund or a lower tax liability. However, this is not always the case. A couple may want to investigate their options by calculating the refund or balance due when filing jointly and separately. Then use the one that provides the biggest refund or the lowest tax liability.






Taxes can get pretty technical and tricky, so if a couple has trouble determining tax liability they should talk to an experienced tax preparer.


   Married Filing Jointly Requirements  

You can use the married filing jointly status if both of the following statements are true:



You were married on the last day of the tax year. In other words, if you were married on December 31, then you are considered to have been married all year. If you were unmarried, divorced, or legally separated (according to state law) on December 31, then you are considered unmarried for the year. There is an exception to this rule for the death of a spouse.
You and your spouse both agree to file a joint tax return.






Before filing taxes, married couples should run some calculations to determine whether it makes more sense financially for them to file jointly or separately. Filing jointly is usually more rewarding, although not always.



If you were not divorced or legally separated on December 31, you are considered unmarried if all of the following apply:



You lived apart from your spouse for the last six months of the tax year (not including temporary absences for reasons such as business, medical care, school, or military service)
You file your tax return separately from your spouse's
You paid over half the cost of keeping up your home during the tax year
Your home was the main home of your child, stepchild, or foster child for more than half of the tax year




Is There a Benefit to Filing Taxes as Married Filing Jointly?
That depends on your personal circumstances. Married couples often find that filing jointly makes sense financially. Other than saving time, filing jointly tends to offer more generous tax breaks.




When Should Married Couples File Taxes Separately?
Despite the many benefits of filing jointly, there are instances in which filing separately may be more beneficial. This may be the case, for example, if either you or your spouse has significant miscellaneous deductions or medical expenses to claim.




What Is the Standard Deduction for Married Filing Jointly?
The standard deduction for married couples filing jointly in the 2022 tax year is $25,900. This is the amount that is not subject to taxation. This threshold increases to $27,700. Remember, you file 2022 taxes in 2023 and taxes for the 2023 tax year will be filed in 2024.


   The Bottom Line  

Married filing jointly is one of the statuses that taxpayers can choose from when they file their annual tax returns. This status is used by married couples who decide to file a single return together even if one spouse doesn't have any income. The couple must include their total income, deductions, and credits on that return. Filing jointly as a married couple may come with certain advantages, such as a lower tax bill and/or a higher refund. But it's always a good idea to prepare separate and joint returns to see which one makes more sense.
What Is Married Filing Separately?  

Married filing separately is a tax status for married couples who choose to record their respective incomes, exemptions, and deductions on separate tax returns.



The alternative to married filing separately is married filing jointly. Usually, it makes sense financially for married couples to file jointly. However, when one spouse has significant medical expenses or miscellaneous itemized deductions, or when both spouses have about the same amount of income, it might be wiser to file separately.





Key Takeaways

Married filing separately is a tax status used by married couples who choose to record their incomes, exemptions, and deductions on separate tax returns.Some couples might benefit from filing separately, especially when one spouse has significant medical expenses or miscellaneous itemized deductions.However, filing separately means potentially not being able to take advantage of certain tax benefits offered exclusively to joint filers.


   How It Works  

The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) gives taxpayers five tax filing status options when they submit their annual tax returns: single, married filing jointly, married filing separately, head of household, or qualifying widow(er).



Anyone who files as married in either category—filing separately or filing jointly—must be married as of the last day of that tax year. In other words, someone who filed taxes for the year 2022 as married must have been married no later than Dec. 31, 2022.



Using the married filing separately status may be appealing and offer financial advantages to certain couples. Combining incomes and filing jointly might push them into a higher tax bracket and thus increase their tax bill.



When couples file separately, they must include their spouse’s information on their returns. According to the IRS, if you and your spouse file separate returns and one of you itemizes deductions, then the other spouse will have a standard deduction of zero. Therefore, the other spouse should also itemize deductions.






Although there are financial advantages to filing separately, couples miss out on tax credits meant for couples who file jointly.


   Standard Deduction for Married Filing Separately  

As a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) of 2017, the standard deduction rose substantially in the 2018 tax year.



A standard deduction is the portion of income that’s not subject to tax, thereby reducing taxable income. The IRS allows tax filers to take a standard deduction. However, the deduction amount is dependent on your filing status, age, and whether you are disabled or claimed as a dependent on someone else’s tax return.



For the 2022 tax year, the standard deduction for single taxpayers and married couples filing separately is $12,950. For heads of households, the deduction is $19,400, while for married couples filing jointly, it is $25,900.For the 2023 tax year, the standard deduction for single taxpayers and married couples filing separately is $13,850. For heads of households, the deduction is $20,800, while for married couples filing jointly, it is $27,700.



As a result, one spouse must have significant miscellaneous deductions or medical expenses for the couple to gain any advantage from filing separately.






If you and your spouse both generated taxable income, calculate your tax bill as a joint and separate filer before filing, to determine which of the two will save you more money.


   Married Filing Separately vs. Married Filing Jointly  

Married filing jointly offers the most tax savings, especially when spouses have different income levels. If you use the married filing separately status, then you may be unable to take advantage of a number of potentially valuable tax breaks, such as the following:


  Child and Dependent Care Credit  

The Child and Dependent Care Credit is a nonrefundable tax credit used by taxpayers to claim unreimbursed childcare expenses. Childcare can include fees paid for babysitters, daycare, summer camps—provided that they aren’t overnight—and other care providers for children under the age of 13 or dependents of any age who aren’t physically or mentally able to care for themselves.


  American Opportunity Tax Credit (AOTC)  

The American Opportunity Tax Credit (AOTC) helps offset costs for post-secondary education. It was introduced in 2009 and requires that couples filing jointly have a modified adjusted gross income (MAGI) of no more than $160,000 to be eligible for full credit. Couples who make $160,000 to $180,000, meanwhile, can apply for a partial AOTC.



The maximum reward is an annual credit of $2,500 on qualified educational expenses for the first four years that a student attends an approved postsecondary institution.


  Lifetime Learning Credit (LLC)  

The Lifetime Learning Credit (LLC) allows parents to claim the amount spent on tuition and receive a 20% tax credit on the first $10,000 of qualified education expenses, resulting in savings of up to $2,000 on each tax return. Qualifying tuition includes undergraduate, graduate, or professional degree courses.



There is an income limit to qualify for the LLC. The MAGI is $80,000 for 2022 and 2023 for single filers and $160,000 for married couples filing jointly.






A couple who files a separate tax return can also take deductions for their contributions to a traditional individual retirement account (IRA), but the income limits for taking them as a deduction if they or their spouse has a retirement plan at work are much lower than for those who file jointly. The maximum contribution permitted in both years is $6,000 ($7,000 for those aged 50 and over) in 2022, increasing to $6,500 (and $7,500) in 2023.
Any expenses related to the adoption of a qualifying child can be taken if couples file jointly, but probably not if they file separately (check with a tax expert). The maximum credit allowed for adoptions is the total amount of qualified adoption expenses up to $14,890 for 2022 and $15,950 in 2023.


   Benefits of Married Filing Separately  

Tax bills aside, there is one scenario in which married filing separately may be especially wise. If you don’t want to be liable for your spouse’s taxes and suspect that they are hiding income or claiming deductions or credits falsely, then filing separately is probably the best option.



Signing a joint return means that both spouses are responsible for the accuracy of the return and for any tax liabilities or penalties that may apply. By signing your own return and not a joint one, you are only responsible for the accuracy of your own information and for any tax liability and penalties that may ensue.


   State Rules Vary  

If you live in community property states—Arizona, California, Idaho, Louisiana, Nevada, New Mexico, Texas, Washington, and Wisconsin—you may need to see a tax professional, because the rules about separate incomes can be tricky.



In most cases, it makes sense for married couples to file jointly, especially since the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) of 2017 was passed. However, there are exceptions, including when one spouse has significant miscellaneous deductions or medical expenses.




Do You Need Your Spouse’s Income for Married Filing Separately?
It’s not necessary for married couples to declare their spouse’s income when filing separately—unless they live in a community property state.




Can You File Separately After Filing Jointly?
Yes, married couples are permitted to file jointly one year and separately the next year.
What Is a Married Put?  

Married put is the name given to an options trading strategy where an investor, holding a long position in a stock, purchases an at the money put option on the same stock to protect against depreciation in the stock's price.



The benefit is that the investor can lose a small but limited amount of money on the stock in the worst price drop scenario, yet still can participate in any gains from price appreciation. The downside is that the put option costs a premium and it is usually significant.



In terms of downside protection, a married put may be compared with a covered call.





Key Takeaways

A married put options strategy protects an investor from a drastic drop in the price of the underlying stock.The cost of the option can make this strategy prohibitively expensive if used often.Put options vary in price, depending on the volatility of the underlying stock, the strike price compared to the stock price, and the time until expiration.The strategy might work well for low-volatility stocks where investors are worried about a surprise announcement that could affect the stock price negatively.Long-term investors probably don't need married puts because they shouldn't be concerned with short-term price fluctuations.


   How a Married Put Works  

A married put works similarly to an insurance policy. It is a bullish strategy used when the investor is concerned about potential near-term uncertainties in the stock price.



By owning the stock with a protective put option, the investor receives the benefits of stock ownership, such as dividends and the right to vote. In contrast, just owning a call option, while equally as bullish as owning the stock, does not confer the same benefits of stock ownership.

A married put behaves synthetically like a long call, and as a result will have unlimited profit potential, as there is no ceiling on the price appreciation of the underlying stock.



However, profit is always lower than it would be by owning just the stock. It's decreased by the cost or premium of the put option. Reaching breakeven for the strategy occurs when the underlying stock rises by the amount of the options premium paid. Anything above that amount is profit.



The benefit of a married put is that there is now a floor under the stock, limiting downside risk. The floor is the difference between the price of the underlying stock at the time the married put was bought and the strike price of the put.



Put another way, when an investor purchased the option, if the underlying stock traded exactly at the strike price, the loss for the strategy is capped at exactly the price paid for the option.



A married put is also considered a synthetic long call since it has the same profit profile. The strategy is similar to buying a regular call option (without the underlying stock) because the same dynamic is true for both: limited loss, unlimited potential for profit.



The difference between these strategies is simply how much less capital is required to buy a long call.






A put is considered married when the stock and the put option are bought at the same time. The trader would instruct the broker that the stock will be delivered if the put is exercised.


   Married Put Example  

Let's say a trader chooses to buy 100 shares of XYZ stock for $20 per share and one XYZ $17.50 put for $0.50 (100 shares x $0.50 = $50). With this combination, they have purchased a stock position with a cost of $20 per share but have also bought a form of insurance to protect themselves in case the stock declines below $17.50 before the put's expiration.



So, say the stock price drops unexpectedly to $15 per share. The trader's loss of $5 per share on the long position could be partially offset by the put's profit of $2.50.


   When to Use a Married Put  

Rather than a pure profit-making strategy, a married put is a capital-preserving strategy. The downside loss potential is limited. Bear in mind that the premium paid for the put is a built-in cost that reduces the strategy's savings potential.



Therefore, investors typically use a married put as an insurance policy against near-term uncertainty in an otherwise bullish stock, or as protection against an unforeseen price breakdown.



Newer investors can benefit from knowing that their losses in the stock will be limited. This can give them confidence as they learn more about different investing strategies.



Of course, this protection comes at a cost, which includes the price of the option, commissions, and possibly other fees.




What's a Married Put Option?
A married put option is a put option purchased at the same time an investor buys the underlying asset. It's also known as a protective put option.




How Does a Married Put Help Investors?
A married put provides a hedge against loss. Essentially, owning the actual stock and owning a put option means that an investor has opposite positions at the same time in the same stock. So, if the stock price goes down, the trader will lose money on the one hand but gain money on the other. So, a loss can be at least partially offset. What's more, while the loss potential is limited, the upside price potential of the stock is unlimited.




Who Uses Married Puts?
Married puts can be used by short-term traders or investors who believe that an asset's price will rise but at the same time want to protect against unexpected, near-term losses. Married puts aren't usually used by people investing for the long term who don't care about short-term market aberrations.
What Is Martial Law?  

Martial law is the substitution of a civil government by military authorities with unlimited powers to suspend the ordinary legal protections of civilian rights. A state of martial law may be declared in response to a crisis or imposed during a coup.



In times of disaster or civil unrest, a declaration of emergency is more common than a declaration of martial law because it is easier to reverse. An emergency declaration allows the government to expand its powers temporarily to deal with a crisis, suspending some civil liberties but avoiding military control.





Key Takeaways:

Martial law is law administered by the military rather than by a civilian government, typically to restore order.Martial law is declared in an emergency, in a response to a crisis, or to control occupied territory.When martial law is declared, civil liberties—such as the right to free movement, free speech, protection from unreasonable searches, and habeas corpus laws—may be suspended.


   Understanding Martial Law  

The declaration of martial law is a rare and momentous decision for a civilian government to make and for good reason. When martial law is declared, civilian control of some or all aspects of government operations is ceded to the military.



This means that, in the case of elected governments, the representatives chosen by the voting population are no longer in power. Civilians have ceded control of the country in exchange for the potential restoration of order, with the possibility that control may not be reclaimed in the future.



When martial law is declared, civil liberties—such as the right to free movement, free speech, or protection from unreasonable searches—can be suspended. The justice system that typically handles issues of criminal and civil law is replaced with a military justice system, such as a military tribunal.



Civilians may be arrested for violating curfews or for offenses that, in normal times, would not be considered serious enough to warrant detention. Laws relating to habeas corpus that are designed to prevent unlawful detention may also be suspended, allowing the military to detain individuals indefinitely without the possibility of recourse.


  Declaring Martial Law  

Considering the negative ramifications martial law can have on a country and its citizens, declaring martial law is a last resort reserved for situations where law and order are rapidly deteriorating. For example, in 1892, the governor of Idaho instituted martial law after a group of rebellious mine workers blew up a mill, which leveled a four-story building and killed several people.



Martial law may be declared to reign in protests, civil unrest, coup d’états, or insurrections. It may also be declared when a country’s military occupies foreign territory, such as at the end of a war.



Typically, the power to declare martial law rests with a nation's president or other top civilian leader. The circumstances in which it may be declared and other limiting factors, such as the amount of time it may be left in effect, are governed by legislation or a country’s constitution.



For example, a president may be authorized to declare martial law during a time of violent civil unrest, but only for 60 days. International laws may also limit the scope and duration of martial law if a country has signed onto a multilateral treaty.


   Special Considerations: States of Emergency vs. Martial Law  

The use of martial law in the wake of natural disasters is less common than during situations of civil unrest or disorder. Rather than declaring martial law and handing over power to the military in the case of a hurricane or earthquake, governments are much more likely to declare a state of emergency.



When a state of emergency is declared, the government may expand its powers or limit the rights of its citizens. The government does not, however, have to hand power over to its military. In some cases, a government may invoke a state of emergency specifically to suppress dissent or opposition groups.
What Is Marxian Economics?  

Marxian economics is a school of economic thought based on the work of 19th-century economist and philosopher Karl Marx.



Marxian economics, or Marxist economics, focuses on the role of labor in the development of an economy and is critical of the classical approach to wages and productivity developed by Adam Smith. Marx argued that the specialization of the labor force, coupled with a growing population, pushes wages down, adding that the value placed on goods and services does not accurately account for the true cost of labor.

Marxian economics is a school of economic thought based on the work of 19th-century economist and philosopher Karl Marx.Marx claimed there are two major flaws in capitalism that lead to exploitation: the chaotic nature of the free market and surplus labor.He argued that the specialization of the labor force, coupled with a growing population, pushes wages down, adding that the value placed on goods and services does not accurately account for the true cost of labor.Eventually, he predicted that capitalism will lead more people to get relegated to worker status, sparking a revolution and production being turned over to the state.


   Understanding Marxian Economics  

Much of Marxian economics is drawn from Karl Marx's seminal work "Das Kapital," his magnum opus first published in 1867. In the book, Marx described his theory of the capitalist system, its dynamism, and its tendencies toward self-destruction.



Much of Das Kapital spells out Marx’s concept of the “surplus value” of labor and its consequences for capitalism. According to Marx, it was not the pressure of labor pools that drove wages to the subsistence level but rather the existence of a large army of unemployed, which he blamed on capitalists. He maintained that within the capitalist system, labor was a mere commodity that could gain only subsistence wages.



Capitalists, however, could force workers to spend more time on the job than was necessary to earn their subsistence and then appropriate the excess product, or surplus value, created by the workers. In other words, Marx argued that workers create value through their labor but are not properly compensated. Their hard work, he said, is exploited by the ruling classes, who generate profits not by selling their products at a higher price but by paying staff less than the value of their labor.






Marx claimed there are two major flaws inherent in capitalism that lead to exploitation: the chaotic nature of the free market and surplus labor.


   Marxian Economics vs. Classical Economics  

Marxian economics is a rejection of the classical view of economics developed by economists such as Adam Smith. Smith and his peers believed that the free market, an economic system powered by supply and demand with little or no government control, and an onus on maximizing profit, automatically benefits society.



Marx disagreed, arguing that capitalism consistently only benefits a select few. Under this economic model, he argued that the ruling class becomes richer by extracting value out of cheap labor provided by the working class.



In contrast to classical approaches to economic theory, Marx’s favored government intervention. Economic decisions, he said, should not be made by producers and consumers and instead ought to be carefully managed by the state to ensure that everyone benefits.



He predicted that capitalism would eventually destroy itself as more people get relegated to worker status, leading to a revolution and production being turned over to the state.


   Special Considerations  

Marxian economics is considered separate from Marxism, even if the two ideologies are closely related. Where it differs is that it focuses less on social and political matters. More broadly, Marxian economic principles clash with the virtues of capitalist pursuits.



During the first half of the twentieth century, with the Bolshevik revolution in Russia and the spread of communism throughout Eastern Europe, it seemed the Marxist dream had finally and firmly taken root.



However, that dream collapsed before the century had ended. The people of Poland, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, East Germany, Romania, Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, Albania, and the USSR rejected Marxist ideology and entered a remarkable transition toward private property rights and a market-exchange based system.
What Is Marxism?  

Marxism is a social, political, and economic philosophy named after the 19th-century German philosopher and economist Karl Marx. His work examines the historical effects of capitalism on labor, productivity, and economic development, and argues that a worker revolution is needed to replace capitalism with a communist system.



Marxism posits that the struggle between social classes—specifically between the bourgeoisie, or capitalists, and the proletariat, or workers—defines economic relations in a capitalist economy and will lead inevitably to a communist revolution.





Key Takeaways

Marxism is an economic and political theory that examines the flaws inherent in capitalism and seeks to identify an alternative, which he called "utopian socialism."Marxist theories were influential in the development of socialism, which requires shared ownership by workers of the means of production.Communism outright rejects the concept of private ownership, mandating that "the people," in fact the government, collectively own and control the production and distribution of all goods and services.


   Understanding Marxism  

Marxism is both a social and political theory, and encompasses Marxist class conflict theory and Marxian economics. Marxism was first publicly formulated in 1848 in the pamphlet The Communist Manifesto by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, which lays out the theory of class struggle and revolution.



Marxian economics focuses on criticism of capitalism, detailed by Marx in his book Das Kapital, published in 1867.



Generally, Marxism argues that capitalism as a form of economic and social reproduction is inherently flawed and will ultimately fail.



Capitalism is defined as a mode of production in which business owners (the capitalists) own all of the means of production (the factory, the tools and machinery, the raw materials, the final product, and the profits earned from their sale). Workers (labor) are hired for wages and have no ownership stake and no share in the profits.



Moreover, the wages paid to workers are lower than the economic value that their work creates for the capitalist. This is the source of capitalists' profits and it is at the root of the inherent class struggle between labor and capital.






Another theory developed by Marx is historical materialism. This theory proposes that society at any given point in time is ordered by the type of organization and technology used in the processes of production. In the modern era of industrial capitalism, capitalists organize labor in factories or offices where they work for wages using modern tools and machines.


   Marxian Economics  

Like other classical economists, Karl Marx believed in a labor theory of value (LTV) to explain relative differences in market prices. This theory stated that the value of a product can be measured objectively by the average number of hours of labor required to produce it. In other words, if a table takes twice as long to make as a chair, then the table should be considered twice as valuable. What Marx added to this theory was the conclusion that this labor value represented the exploitation of workers.



Marx claimed that there are two major flaws in capitalism that lead to the exploitation of workers by employers: the chaotic nature of free market competition and the extraction of surplus labor.



Marx predicted that capitalism would eventually destroy itself as more people become relegated to working-class status, inequality rises, and competition drives corporate profits to zero. This would lead, he surmised, to a revolution after which production would be turned over to the working class as a whole.


   Class Conflict and the Demise of Capitalism  

Marx’s class theory portrays capitalism as one step in a historical progression of economic systems that follow one another in a natural sequence. They are driven, he posited, by vast impersonal forces of history that play out through the behavior and conflict among social classes. According to Marx, every society is divided into social classes, whose members have more in common with one another than with members of other social classes.



The following are some key elements of Marx’s theories of how class conflict would play out in a capitalist system:



Capitalist society is made up of two classes: the bourgeoisie, or business owners, who control the means of production, and the proletariat, or workers, whose labor transforms raw commodities into goods that have market value.
Ordinary laborers, who do not own the means of production, such as factories, buildings, and materials, have little power in the capitalist economic system. Workers are also readily replaceable in periods of high unemployment, further devaluing their perceived worth.
To maximize profits, business owners have to get the most possible work out of their laborers while paying them the lowest possible wages. This creates an imbalance between owners and laborers, whose work is exploited by the owners for their own gain.
Since workers have little personal stake in the process of production, Marx believed they would become alienated from their work, and even from their own humanity, and turn resentful toward business owners.
The bourgeoisie are able to leverage social institutions, including government, media, academia, organized religion, and the banking and financial systems, as tools and weapons against the proletariat with the goal of maintaining their positions of power and privilege.
Ultimately, the inherent inequalities and exploitative economic relations between these two classes will lead to a revolution in which the working class rebels against the bourgeoisie, takes control of the means of production, and abolishes capitalism.



Thus, Marx thought that the capitalist system contained the seeds of its own destruction. The alienation and exploitation of the proletariat that are fundamental to capitalist relations would inevitably drive the working class to rebel against the bourgeoisie and seize control of the means of production.



This revolution would be led by enlightened leaders, known as “the vanguard of the proletariat,” who understood the class structure of society and would unite the working class by raising awareness and class consciousness.



After the revolution, Marx predicted, private ownership of the means of production would be replaced by collective ownership, first under socialism and then under communism. 



In the final stage of human development, social classes and class struggle would no longer exist.






Karl Marx believed that the proletariat would overthrow capitalism in a violent revolution.


   Communism vs. Socialism vs. Capitalism  

Marx and Engels' ideas laid the groundwork for the theory and practice of communism, which advocates for a classless system in which all property and wealth are communally (rather than privately) owned.



China, Cuba, Laos, North Korea, and Vietnam are the only nations that have communist systems today. Notably, most of these nations have relaxed some of their most rigid policies in the name of economic progress and global trade.



The Soviet Union was an experiment in communism that was created in 1921 and collapsed in 1991, leaving behind 15 former Soviet Socialist Republics to rebuild their economies from scratch. None chose communism as a model.


  Socialism  

Socialism predates communism by several decades. Its early adherents called for a more egalitarian distribution of wealth, solidarity among workers, better working conditions, and common ownership of land and manufacturing equipment.



Socialism is based on the concept of public ownership and regulation of the means of production, but individuals may still own property. Rather than rising out of a class revolution, socialist reform has taken place within existing social and political structures, whether they are democratic, technocratic, oligarchic, or totalitarian.


  Capitalism  

Both communism and socialism oppose capitalism, an economic system characterized by private ownership and a system of laws that protect the right to own or transfer private property.



In a capitalist economy, private individuals or the companies they create own the means of production and the right to profit from them.



Communism and socialism aim to right the wrongs of capitalism’s free-market system. These include worker exploitation, inequities between classes, and outright poverty.


   Critiques of Marxism  

Marx inspired multitudes of followers, but many of his predictions have not come to pass. Marx believed that increasing competition would not produce better goods for consumers but would lead to bankruptcies and the rise of monopolies, with control of production in fewer and fewer hands.



Bankrupt former capitalists, he thought, would join the proletariat, eventually creating an army of the unemployed. In addition, the market economy, which by its nature is unplanned, would experience crippling supply-and-demand problems and cause severe economic depressions.



Capitalism has not collapsed, but it has changed since Marx's time. Governments in many capitalist countries, including the U.S., have the power to crack down on monopolies and monopolistic business practices. Governments set minimum wages and regulatory agencies set standards for worker protection.



It is not the Utopian ideal. Economic inequality has increased in many capitalist societies. There have been recessions periodically as well as one Great Depression, but they are not thought to be an inherent feature of free markets.



Indeed, a society entirely without competition, money, or private property has not materialized in the modern world, and recent history suggests it is unlikely to emerge in the future.




What Kind of Philosophy Is Marxism?
Marxism is a philosophy developed by Karl Marx in the second half of the 19th century that unifies social, political, and economic theory. It is mainly concerned with the consequences of a society divided between an ownership class and a working class and proposes a new system of shared ownership of the means of production as a solution to the inevitable inequality that capitalism fosters.




What Did Marx Predict for the Future?
Marx thought that the capitalistic system would inevitably self-destruct. Competition would grow so fierce that most businesses would fold and be absorbed into unwieldy monopolies. Workers would reject a system that exploited them. The oppressed workers would ultimately overthrow the owners to take control of the means of production, ushering in a classless society of shared ownership.




Was Karl Marx Right?
Not so far. Since the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, the most successful of the few remaining communist countries, notably China and Vietnam, have reformed some of their most rigid practices. None has been able to entirely eliminate personal property, money, and class systems in the way that Karl Marx envisioned.In 2021, capitalism, in its various forms, remains the dominant economic system. But it has changed, too, since Marx's time, with some of the worst excesses addressed. Worker safety standards, child labor laws, minimum wage laws, and anti-poverty programs are all examples.




Is Marxism the Same Thing As Communism?
Marxism is a philosophy, while communism is a system of government based on Marxist principles. Marx envisioned a society in which workers owned the means of production. In real-world communism, governments own the means of production.


   The Bottom Line  

Marxism is the social and economic theory developed by Karl Marx in the 19th century. Marxian economics describes the capitalist system of production as inherently unfair to the workers, who represent most of the population.



Marx's social theories connected these flaws of capitalism with a growing class conflict between labor and business owners, ultimately leading to a revolution that would empower the working class and create communal ownership of the means of production.



His theories have been tested in the real world. The communist experiment in the Soviet Union ended in 1991. It continues to be tested in China, which is creating a hybrid social and economic system that Marx might not recognize.
What Is Mass Customization?  

Mass customization is the process of delivering market goods and services that are modified to satisfy a specific customer's needs. Mass customization is a marketing and manufacturing technique that combines the flexibility and personalization of custom-made products with the low unit costs associated with mass production. Other names for mass customization include made-to-order or built-to-order.





Key Takeaways

Mass customization is a process that allows a customer to personalize certain features of a product while still keeping costs at or near mass production prices.Innovative manufacturing techniques help companies produce interchangeable parts that can be combined in a variety of ways to build a cost-effective product that satisfies a specific customer's needs.The four primary types of mass customization are collaborative customization, adaptive customization, transparent customization, and cosmetic customization.Various companies employ mass customization techniques, including retail companies, software creators, financial services companies, and modular home builders.Companies that offer mass customization can give themselves a competitive advantage over other companies that only offer generic products.


   Understanding Mass Customization  

Mass customization allows a customer to design certain made-to-order features of a product while still keeping costs closer to that of mass-produced products. In some cases, the components of the product are modular. This flexibility allows the client to mix-and-match options to create a semi-custom final product.



Mass customization may apply to many fields, but many connect it to the retail industry. Software creators may use this method to include software-based product configurations that enable end-users to add or change specific functions of a core product. Even the financial services industry embraces mass customization through the growth of independent, fee-only advisory firms.


   The Growth of Mass Customization  

B. Joseph Pine II looked at the growth of the American economy due to mass production. In his book, Mass Customization: The New Frontier in Business Competition (Harvard Business Review Press, 1992), he describes four primary types of mass customization which took the concept of mass production to a new level:



Collaborative customization: companies work in partnership with clients to offer products or services uniquely suited to each clientAdaptive customization: companies produce standardized products which the end-user may customizeTransparent customization: companies provide unique products to individual clients without overtly stating the products are customizedCosmetic customization: companies produce standardized products but market them in different ways to various customers



Pine focused on the concept of creating a small number of interchangeable pieces. The individual parts may be combined in a variety of ways producing a cost-efficient production model and still allows consumers to choose how the pieces go together.


   Examples of Mass Customization  

Fee-only, independent financial advisors allow their clients to customize their portfolio holdings to match their unique situations. The consumer may choose products that match their investment risk tolerance, time horizon, investment style, and future goals.



Certain furniture companies offer mass customization by providing multiple options for various components or features. This flexibility may include different fabrics, furniture legs, or pieces that combine in numerous configurations. Also, modular home builders use mass-customization models by allowing customers to make changes to the base home package.


   Benefits of Mass Customization  

Mass customization enables manufacturers to delay the step of product differentiation until the final phase of manufacturing. Rather than the manufacturer deciding on the features that make the product unique, mass customization allows the consumer to make these decisions. For some consumers, the ability to customize a product is enough to sway their buying decision in favor of one company over another.



Mass customization can then become part of a lucrative marketing strategy for a company. Companies that offer customization can give themselves a competitive advantage over their rivals. They can tout their ability to produce a semi-custom product at a reasonable price to consumers who are looking for an upgrade over a generic product. As long as the company is able to deliver a product that does not compromise on quality, they have an opportunity to increase sales, profits, and brand loyalty for their one-of-a-kind products.



Mass customization can also help a company with the costs associated with excess inventory. Implementing a just-in-time (JIT) approach to manufacturing can assist companies in minimizing inventory and increasing efficiency. Companies that take a JIT approach to mass customization will need reliable suppliers and an inventory replenishment system that notifies them exactly when new materials need to be ordered.
What Is Mass Production?  

Mass production is the manufacturing of large quantities of standardized products, often using assembly lines or automation technology. Mass production facilitates the efficient production of a large number of similar products.



Mass production is also referred to as flow production, repetitive flow production, series production, or serial production.



In mass production, mechanization is used to achieve high volume, detailed organization of material flow, careful control of quality standards, and division of labor. An early example of the demand for standardized products in large quantities came from military organizations and their need for uniforms and other supplies. Precision machining equipment has led to large-scale demand for mass-produced products created cheaply with small workforces.





Key Takeaways

Mass production is the manufacturing of large quantities of standardized products, often using assembly lines or automation technology.Mass production has many advantages, such as producing a high level of precision, lower costs from automation and fewer workers, higher levels of efficiency, and prompt distribution and marketing of an organization’s products.Henry Ford, the founder of Ford Motor Co., developed the assembly line technique of mass production in 1913.


   Understanding Mass Production  

Henry Ford, founder of Ford Motor Co. (F), developed the assembly line technique of mass production. In 1913, he pioneered the moving assembly line for production of the Ford Model T automobile. The reduced manufacturing time for parts allowed the company to apply the same method to chassis assembly and drastically reduced the time it took to build the Model T automobile.



Ford continued to refine the process, even hiring someone who studied the way people moved most efficiently. From 1908 to 1927, Ford built more than 15 million Model T cars. As a result of Ford’s mass production, cars became something that the general public could afford, rather than a luxury item that only a limited number of people had access to. Since then, Ford’s concept of time- and space-efficient production has been adopted by most industries, lowering the costs of everyday items.


   Advantages of Mass Production  

Mass production has many advantages. If production is stringently monitored, mass production can result in a high level of precision because production line machines have preset parameters. Mass production also results in lower costs because the automated assembly line production process requires fewer workers.



In addition, mass production can create higher levels of efficiency because mass-produced items can be assembled at a quicker rate through automation. Rapid assembly aids the prompt distribution and marketing of an organization’s products that, in turn, can create a competitive advantage and higher profits for a company. For example, McDonald’s (MCD) has a competitive advantage in the fast-food industry because of the speed at which it can produce a meal for time-conscious customers.


   Disadvantages of Mass Production  

However, not everything about mass production is beneficial. Establishing an automated assembly line is capital-intensive and requires a significant up-front investment of time and resources. If there is an error in the production design, an extensive investment of time and money may be necessary to redesign and rebuild mass production processes. 



A revision of the mass production processes may be required for reasons other than errors. For example, if a pharmaceutical company has a comprehensive assembly line in place for the production of a popular drug, it would be time-consuming and expensive for them to respond to a U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulatory change requiring a different production process.



While an advantage of mass production is that it can reduce labor costs, employees who remain part of an assembly line may lack motivation because their tasks are repetitive. The boredom caused by repetitive work can lead to low employee morale and increased levels of turnover.






Manufacturers are experimenting with the integration of three-dimensional (3D) printers in the mass production of everyday products.


   Example of Mass Production  

Mass production now touches most of what American consumers buy, from cars to clothing to toothbrushes. For example, in 1953, every marshmallow Peep took 27 hours to make by hand. With the introduction of the assembly line, this time requirement had been reduced to six minutes per Peep, and an average of 4.2 million Peeps were made every day in 2003.



Ford took its assembly lines one step further, introducing robots that could unload a die-casting press in 1961. Now robotics play a major part in much mass production, with humans standing in as quality assurance.




Does mass production mean lower wages for workers?
In some areas, factory workers are paid less and work in dismal conditions. However, this does not have to be the case. Workers in the United States tend to make higher wages and often have unions to advocate for better working conditions. Elsewhere, mass production jobs may come with poor wages and working conditions.




Is mass production expensive to set up?
Creating a mass production system can be expensive to set up and even more expensive to alter if changes need to be made after the production has already started. The cost of setup is generally offset by the efficiency with which products are made once the system is up and running.




Does mass production produce quality items?
It can. As Henry Ford proved, very complex products can be made successfully using assembly line techniques. However, if there are unforeseen problems with an element of your product, that issue can be replicated thousands of times before it may be noticed. This is why product recalls are frequent among mass-produced items.


   The Bottom Line  

Mass production, also known as flow production, repetitive flow production, series production or serial production, is a manufacturing process where goods are produced in large quantities using standardized designs, machinery, and assembly line techniques. The goal of mass production is to produce goods at a lower cost, making them more affordable and accessible to consumers. This is achieved by dividing the production process into smaller, specialized tasks that can be performed by unskilled or semi-skilled workers using specialized machinery. It should be noted that mass production is capital intensive. Mass production has revolutionized many industries, including automotive, electronics, and consumer goods, and has enabled the production of large quantities of goods quickly and efficiently.
What Is a Master-Feeder Structure?  

A master-feeder structure is a device commonly used by hedge funds to pool taxable and tax-exempt capital raised from investors in the United States and overseas into a master fund. Separate investment vehicles, otherwise known as feeders, are established for each group of investors.



Investors put capital into their respective feeder funds, which ultimately invest assets into a centralized vehicle known as the master fund. The master fund is responsible for making all portfolio investments and conducting all trading activity. Management and performance fees are paid at the feeder-fund level.





Key Takeaways

In a master-feeder structure, investment funds are formed from investor capital; these feeder funds, in turn, invest in a centralized master fund.Hedge funds commonly use master-feeder structures to accommodate both U.S. and non-U.S. investors.The master-feeder structure allows funds to benefit from economies of scale and favorable "pass-through" tax treatment.


   How the Master-Feeder Structure Works  

The master-feeder structure begins with the investors, who deposit capital into the feeder fund. The feeder fund, containing all the limited partnership/shareholder capital, then purchases "shares" of the master fund, much like it would buy shares of any company’s stock. The primary difference, of course, is that a feeder fund—by buying into the master fund—receives all of the master fund’s income attributes, including interest, gains, tax adjustments, and dividends.



Although this two-tiered structure can exist in a variety of forms like "funds of funds" mutual funds the master-feeder structure is especially common among hedge funds catering to both U.S. and offshore or overseas investors. The use of the master-feeder fund structure allows asset managers to benefit from a large capital pool while also being able to fashion investment funds that cater to niche markets.


   Composition of Master-Feeders  

The average master-feeder structure involves one offshore master fund with one onshore feeder and one offshore feeder. Feeder funds investing in the same master fund have the option of choice and variation. In other words, the feeders may differ in investor type, fee structures, investment minimums, net asset values, and various other operational attributes.



In this way, the feeder funds do not have to adhere to a specific master fund but can function legally as independent entities with the ability to invest in various master funds.



For example, if feeder fund A's $100 contribution and feeder fund B's $200 contribution provided the total investments to a master fund, then fund A would receive one-third of the master fund returns while fund B would receive two-thirds of the returns.


   Advantages of the Master-Feeder Structure  

One significant advantage of the master-feeder structure is the consolidation of various portfolios into one entity. Consolidation allows for reductions of operation and trading costs. A larger portfolio has the benefit of economies of scale. Also, because of its size, the portfolio has better options when it comes to service and more favorable terms offered by prime brokers and other institutions.





Pros

Economies of scale
Tax-advantaged partnership status
Convenient for both domestic and international investors



Cons

Dividends subject to witholding tax (if offshore)
Difficulty of setting universal investment strategy





   Disadvantages of the Master-Feeder Structure  

The primary drawback to the master-feeder structure is that funds held offshore are typically subjected to a 30% withholding tax on U.S. dividends. There is another disadvantage inherent in the structure, as it pools together a combination of investors that often have a wide spectrum of characteristics as well as investment priorities.



Often, the battle to find a middle ground is uphill, if not entirely impossible, as investments and strategies that are suitable to one specific type of investor will be unsuited, if not oppositional, to the requirements of a different type of investor.


   Real-World Example of Master-Feeder Structure  

Relationships between a master fund and its feeder funds can be complex, as a 2018 court case showed. At issue was how redemptions by a feeder fund from a master fund are treated in a liquidation scenario.



The Ardon Maroon Asia Dragon Feeder Fund was a feeder fund to the Ardon Maroon Asia Master Fund. The same people served as directors of two funds. Also, both funds appointed the same investment manager, administrator, and transfer agent.



In 2014, one of the feeder fund's investors submitted a redemption notice. The feeder fund, which held no assets of its own, assumed the master fund would automatically satisfy the redemption request—something called a "back-to-back redemption." However, both funds went into liquidation a few months later. When the original investor submitted a proof of debt, seeking to collect their money, it was rejected by the liquidators of the Ardon Maroon Asia master fund, on the basis that Asia Dragon had never officially submitted a separate redemption request notice to it.



A lawsuit ensued, filed in the Cayman Islands, where the funds were based. In mid-2018, the Grand Court of the Cayman Islands decided in favor of the master fund. Although back-to-back redemptions are common industry practices, the court noted that the constitutional documents of Ardon Maroon Asia did require a written notice of redemption from its feeder funds.



So Asia Dragon had been remiss in not separately notifying its master fund even though the same people served as directors of two funds, and both appointed the same investment manager, administrator, and transfer agent.
What Is a Master Limited Partnership (MLP)?  

A master limited partnership (MLP) is a business venture in the form of a publicly traded limited partnership. It combines the tax benefits of a private partnership with the liquidity of a publicly traded company.



A master limited partnership trades on national exchanges. MLPs generally experience cash flow stability and are required by the partnership agreement to distribute a set amount of cash to investors. Their structure can also help reduce the cost of capital in capital-intensive businesses, such as the energy sector.



The first MLP was organized in 1981; however, by 1987, Congress effectively limited the use of them to the real estate and natural resources sectors. These limitations were put into place out of concern over too much lost corporate tax revenue. MLPs do not pay federal income taxes.





Key Takeaways

A master limited partnership (MLP) is a company organized as a publicly traded partnership.MLPs combine a private partnership's tax advantages with a stock's liquidity.MLPs have two types of partners: general partners, who manage the MLP and oversee its operations, and limited partners, who are investors in the MLP.Investors receive tax-sheltered distributions from the MLP.MLPs are considered low-risk, long-term investments, providing a slow but steady income stream.


   Understanding Master Limited Partnerships (MLPs)  

The MLP is a hybrid legal entity that combines elements of two business structures—a partnership and a corporation. First of all, it is considered the aggregate of its partners rather than a separate legal entity (as is the case with a corporation).



Second, it technically has no employees. The general partners are responsible for providing all necessary operational services. General partners usually hold an approximate 2% stake in the venture and have the option to increase their ownership.



An MLP issues units instead of shares. However, these units are often traded on national stock exchanges. As a result, they are a liquid security. Traditional partnerships cannot offer the same level of liquidity.



Since an MLP's publicly traded units are not stock shares, those who invest in MLPs are commonly referred to as unitholders, rather than shareholders. Those who buy into an MLP are called limited partners. These unitholders are allocated a share of the MLP's income, deductions, losses, and credits.



MLPs have two classes of partners:



Limited partners are investors who purchase shares in the MLP and provide the capital for the entity's operations. They receive periodic distributions from the MLP, typically every quarter. Limited partners are also known as silent partners.
General partners are the owners who are responsible for managing the day-to-day operations of the MLP. They receive compensation based on the partnership's business performance.


   Tax Treatment of MLPs  
  Pass-Through Tax Consequences  

An MLP is treated as a limited partnership for tax purposes, which is a significant tax advantage for investors. A limited partnership has a pass-through, or flow-through, tax structure. This means that all profits and losses are passed through to the limited partners. The MLP itself pays no taxes on its revenues, as most incorporated businesses do. Instead, the limited partners pay income taxes only on their portions of the MLP's earnings.



Further, deductions, such as depreciation and depletion, also pass through to the limited partners. Limited partners can use these deductions to reduce their taxable income.



To maintain its pass-through status, at least 90% of the MLP's income must be qualifying income. Qualifying income includes income realized from the exploration, production, or transportation of natural resources or real estate.



In other words, to qualify as a master limited partnership, a company must generate all but 10% of its revenues from natural resources or real estate activities. This definition of qualifying income reduces the sectors in which MLPs can operate.


  Deferred Taxes and the Capital Gains Tax Rate  

Quarterly distributions from the MLP are not unlike quarterly stock dividends. However, a portion of a distribution is treated as a return of capital (ROC) as opposed to dividend income. So, the unitholder does not pay income tax on the distribution. Instead, the distribution reduces the cost basis of units.



The distributions remain tax-deferred until unitholders sell their interests in the MLP. Then, the difference between the cost basis and sale price is taxed at a combination of the ordinary income tax rate (on the return of capital distribution) and the capital gains tax rate (on the appreciation of the units since purchase). This offers a significant, additional tax benefit.






MLPs are taxed as partnerships, not corporations. So their profits are not subject to the double taxation that corporations face. Corporations pay corporate tax and then the shareholders must pay personal taxes on the income from their holdings.


   Advantages and Disadvantages of MLPs  

Like any investment, MLPs have their pros and cons. MLPs may not work for all investors. An investor must weigh the disadvantages against the benefits of holding units of MLPs before they invest.


  Advantages  

MLPs are known for offering slow yet steady investment returns. The slow returns stem from the fact that MLPs are often in slow-growing industries, like pipeline construction. This slow and steady growth means MLPs are low risk. They earn a stable income often based on long-term service contracts. MLPs offer steady cash flows and consistent cash distributions.
The cash distributions of MLPs usually grow slightly faster than inflation. For limited partners, 80% to 90% of the distributions are often tax-deferred. Overall, this lets MLPs offer attractive income yields—often substantially higher than the average dividend yield of equities. Also, with the flow-through entity status (and the absence of double taxation), more capital is available for future projects. The availability of capital keeps the MLP competitive in its industry. 
Further, for the limited partner, cumulative cash distributions could exceed the portion taxed at the capital gains rate once units are sold.
Limited partners' liability for an MLP's debts and obligations is limited to the amount of their capital contribution.
Until the 2017 tax cuts act benefit expires in 2025, investors can deduct 20% of their distributions from their taxable income, reducing the tax they would otherwise pay.
There are benefits to using MLPs for estate planning, as well. When unitholders gift or transfer the MLP units to beneficiaries, both unitholders and beneficiaries avoid paying taxes during the time of transfer. The cost basis will readjust based on the market price during the time of the transfer if the transfer happens because of death. There is no step-up in basis if the MLP's units are gifted. Should the unitholder die and the investment pass to their heirs, the units pass tax-free, and the fair market value is determined to be the value as of the date of death.


  Disadvantages  

MLPs are extremely tax-efficient for investors. However, the filing requirements for this business structure are complex. An MLP’s income, deductions, credits, and other items are detailed each year on an Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Schedule K-1 form that is sent to the investor. The K-1 can be complicated and create extra work for investors (or the tax professionals they hire).
MLP investors are required to pay state income taxes on their allocated portion of income in each state in which the MLP operates (which can be more than one). This can increase their costs.
Another tax-related disadvantage of MLPs is that you cannot use a net loss (more losses than profits) to offset other income. However, net losses may carry forward to the following year. When you eventually sell all of your units, a net loss can then be used as a deduction against other income.
MLPs have limited upside potential. However, this might be expected from an investment that should produce a gradual yet reliable income stream over several years.





Pros

Steady income
Relatively low risk
Tax-advantaged treatment
Liquidity
Limited liability for debts



Cons

Complex tax-filing
Limited capital appreciation
Limited to a few sectors





   Examples of MLPs  

Currently, most MLPs operate in the energy industry. An energy master limited partnership (EMLP) typically provides and manages resources for other energy-based businesses. Examples might include firms that provide pipeline transportation, refinery services, and supply and logistics support services for oil companies.



Many oil and gas firms will organize MLPs instead of issuing shares of stock. Using the MLP structure, they can both raise capital from investors and maintain a stake in operations.



Some corporations may own a sizable interest in their MLPs. They may also set up separate stock-issuing companies whose role is to own units of the corporation's MLP. This structure allows them to redistribute the passive income through the corporation as regular dividends.


  Linn Energy Inc.  

An example of this structure was Linn Energy Inc., which had both an MLP (LINE) and a corporation that owned an interest in the MLP (LNCO). Investors had the option to choose—for tax purposes—how they would like to receive the income the company generated.



The firm was dissolved in 2017 after filing for bankruptcy in 2016. It was reorganized in 2018 as two new companies: Riviera Resources and Roan Resources, both of which exist today. Investors in LINE were given an exchange offer to convert their units into shares of the new entities.



As many MLPs operate in the resources sector, their fortunes are determined by volatile energy and commodities prices (as evidenced by Linn Energy's bankruptcy).



The Alerian MLP Index, the leading gauge of energy infrastructure MLPs, measured an annualized five-year return of 6.2% for the period ending June 30, 2023. Electricity prices were in a slight upward trend over most of that period; however, with crude oil prices rebounding approximately 74% from 2022 to 2023, the Alerian MLP Index surged 30% over that three-year period.



An investor interested in buying MLPs could consider investing in a portfolio of MLPs that is diversified across sectors in order to reduce risk.



For example, Brookfield Asset Management, a leading global alternative asset manager with approximately $850 billion of assets under management, has MLPs in the real estate, infrastructure, and renewable energy sectors.




What's a Master Limited Partnership?
A master limited partnership or MLP is a publicly traded limited partnership focused on the real estate or natural resources sector. Investors can buy units of an MLP on national exchanges. MLPs can offer steady income as well as a variety of tax advantages. They are not without risk, however, due to their concentrated exposure to a single industry.




Does a Master Limited Partnership (MLP) Offer Tax Advantages?
Yes. For limited partners, they offer a pass-through tax structure. Distributions aren't taxed when received. Instead, they remain tax-deferred until units are sold. MLP units (up to a certain amount) can pass to heirs tax-free upon the death of the unitholder. Also, the tax reform act passed in 2017 allows investors to deduct 20% of their distribution immediately from income (until the expiration of the provision in 2025).




What Are Some Examples of Master Limited Partnerships?
In general, master limited partnerships are companies that engage in the exploration, development, processing, or transportation of natural resources. They may also focus on real estate. An MLP could own and operate oil and gas pipelines. Or, it might focus on exploring for and producing crude oil. You could also find MLPs that gather and process natural gas.


   The Bottom Line  

Master limited partnerships (MLPs) carry the best of both private partnerships (tax benefits) and publicly traded companies (liquidity). General partners provide all operational services and MLPs are low-risk, long-term investments.
What Is a Master of Business Administration (MBA)?  

A master of business administration (MBA) is a graduate degree that provides theoretical and practical training for business or investment management. An MBA is designed to help graduates gain a better understanding of general business management functions.



An MBA degree can have a general focus or a specific focus in fields such as accounting, finance, or marketing, and relationship management.





Key Takeaways

An MBA is a graduate business degree focused on management, business, and entrepreneurship.MBA students can also focus on other aspects of business, like finance or risk management.Many schools now offer specialty programs, like sports management, the entertainment business, or healthcare management.Executive MBA programs are available for experienced professionals who cannot commit to a full-time schedule.MBA programs may be full-time, part-time, online, or international, and each program usually has a varying degree of requirements for acceptance.


   How a Master of Business Administration (MBA) Works  

A master of business administration (MBA) is a level up from an undergraduate business degree and generally places the graduate well above those with only undergraduate degrees. Most major universities and colleges provide MBA programs, which usually last two years. To get into an MBA program, an applicant needs to take the Graduate Management Admission Test (GMAT) and be accepted by the program based on its selection criteria.



MBA programs typically include core classes in accounting, management, finance, marketing, and business law. Management training is at the heart of any MBA curriculum, with a focus on leadership, planning, business strategy, organizational behavior, and the more human sides of running a large or small business.



Increasingly, MBA programs are broadening their focus to include training in international business and to focus on the responsibilities and corporate accountability of businesses within their communities.



The MBA degree is seen as essential to enter certain fields, including strategic planning, hedge funds, and private equity firms. Other financial services fields, however, may no longer consider an MBA an entry-level degree to get started.






It is not uncommon to gain professional experience before applying to an MBA program. Many programs require a work resume and demonstration of real world experience prior to joining the program, while other programs may be suitable for candidates straight out of college.


   Types of MBA Programs  

MBA programs will vary between disciplines, specialties, and schools. It is highly likely that MBA candidates are able to find a solution that works for their schedule, interests, and time commitment restraints.


  Two-Year Full-Time  

One of the most common types of MBA programs is a two-year commitment in which candidates attend school full-time. During the first year of the program, MBA candidates may learn more fundamental business skills such as strategy or communication. It's more common for candidates to choose more specific electives during the candidate's second year.



Although requiring a substantial amount of time, a two-year program allows candidates to pursue an internship between the years. The longer duration is also intended to help foster relationships with classmates and give candidates more time to absorb materials.


  One-Year Full-Time  

Accelerated programs crunch a two-year program into a single year. Better for candidates that don't want to spend too much time away from work, this type of MBA program is more intensive, faster paced, and often must sacrifice content quantity.



During a one-year full-time MBA program, candidates may still learn general business skills while selecting specialized electives. However, less time may be dedicated to either group due to the condensed nature of the coursework. One-year programs are often chosen by students trying to accelerate on their current career path as opposed to jumping to a different career path.


  Part-Time  

Students not looking to leave work and willing to attend school for a longer time may pursue a part-time MBA program. This type of program often has greater flexibility on how many courses can be taken at once and how quickly a student must move through the MBA program.



Part-time programs may be more favorable for candidates wanting to study at their own pace. In addition, part-time programs may be better suited based on lifestyle demands (i.e. a single parent may only be able to attend classes during a certain time of the day). Part-time programs may offer the flexibility of evening or weekend classes, allowing candidates to balance part-time, freelance, or gig economy work.


  Online  

One type of MBA program that overlaps with the options above is an online MBA. Often a two-year, one-year, or part-time option, an online MBA allows students to attend school remotely. This type of MBA program grants candidates even greater flexibility around when they take classes and how they attend school. Online programs may also have different approaches on how to foster collaboration compared to in-person options.


  International  

Some MBA programs focus on global operations. Candidates interested in a wider focus wanting to branch out from just domestic companies or segments of a company can help candidates build an international network and foster opportunities around the world. International MBA candidates may be more diverse than traditional or domestic MBAs, especially if the international MBA offers online classes. In addition, international MBA programs may be better suited to prepare candidates for working in a multinational corporation.


  Executive  

Specialized MBA programs are also available for students whose lives and careers do not permit them to attend school full time. For example, executive MBA programs are designed for working professionals hoping to add to their credentials and qualifications. These courses of study typically schedule classes for nights and weekends, sometimes also requiring short residencies of intensive coursework.



Executive MBA programs are typically only open to candidates who already have substantial professional experience, and they thus tend to focus on more advanced topics such as leadership development.


  Specialized  

While MBA candidates can focus on one of the core disciplines of the degree, such as management or finance, many MBA programs allow students to develop concentrations in specific industries. For example, an MBA student might specialize in sports management, entrepreneurship, the entertainment business, or healthcare management.



Even within a management specialty, MBA degrees can allow a concentration on information technology, hospitality, education, or criminal justice. Some MBA programs team up with various professional healthcare programs, such as nursing schools, to offer joint degrees.






MBA programs will have varying length requirements. For example, a degree at Franklin University typically requires 60 credit hours, while the University of Nebraska Omaha program is comprised of 33 credit hours.


   Special Considerations  

The most prestigious MBA programs are nicknamed "M7 MBA Programs". These schools include:



Harvard Business School.Stanford Graduate School of Business.MIT Sloan School of Management.Northwestern University's Kellogg School of Management.University of Chicago's Booth School of Business.Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania.Columbia Business School.



Acceptance into an M7 school is considered more difficult than obtaining acceptance at non-M7 schools. In addition, tuition is substantially higher at M7 schools, though there is usually financial aid, fellowships, or sponsorships available.


  MBA Degrees Uses  

Broadly speaking, an MBA gives degree holders two uses: accelerated advancement in the career they are already pursuing or a strong pivot in a new direction with a newfound skillset.



The Wharton MBA through the University of Pennsylvania communicates the following benefits and uses of an MBA to its prospective candidates:



Greater Awareness of a Global Market. Candidates can use their MBA to better understand what is going on in different areas of the world.
Improve Communication Skills. MBA candidates often must communicate with other professionals, write research papers, and give formal presentations. MBA candidates can use their coursework to improve their ability to connect with others and build relationships.
Expand Professional Network. An MBA degree can be used for the people met along the way. Meeting others, forging relationships, and building a network is a central benefit of an MBA program. In addition to the knowledge obtained, the MBA program can be used to connect with others with the prospect of mutual long-term benefit with your peers. Through formal or informal networking, you can exchange information or ideas with like-minded individuals.
Increased Job Opportunities. MBA candidates are often more desirable compared to other candidates based on their proven skillset and dedication to their profession. In addition, advancement or higher positions may become available to candidates that would otherwise not be considered for roles.
Better Time Management. MBA candidates may have to juggle school, work, family, and life obligations. An often overlooked use of an MBA program is the soft skill practice of managing priorities, meeting deadlines, and organizing one's time to meet all expectations.






Over the past decade, more Americans are prioritizing higher education. In 2021, 24.1 million U.S. citizens age 25 and over held a Masters (not necessarily MBA) degrees. This is an increase of over 8 million citizens compared to 2011.


  MBA Degree Candidate Requirements  

Every MBA program will have different requirements. More prestigious programs or schools will have more competition, and these programs will often require more of candidates before accepting them into the school. For example, the following list is taken from the University of Washington (Bothell)'s MBA program admission requirements:



Two or more years of full-time, professional-level work experience.Two (or more) short application essays.Two professional referees.Official 4-year Bachelor's degree transcript.Demonstration of English Language Proficiency (program and candidate dependent)Minimum 3.0-grade point average for the past 90 quarter credits or 60-semester credits.Interview with admissions committee before acceptance or decision.



Some programs may require submission of a GMAT/GRE score. Other programs like UW-Bothell may temporarily have waived the requirement.


  MBA Degree Cost  

As programs offer different services and benefits, the cost of an MBA will widely vary between program and school. Top-tier MBA programs will often be more expensive than local, smaller options.



In 2022, the first-year budget for the Wharton MBA program was almost $119,000. This includes $85,000 for tuition, $23,000 for room and board, $7,000 for books and supplies, and $4,000 for health insurance. Wharton offers many Fellowship Programs to alleviate the financial burden of the program. Other two-year, full-time programs may yield similar expenses; an estimated two-year program at the University of Chicago cost almost $156,000.



Shorter-term or online programs may be substantially cheaper. For example, an online MBA at the Eller College of Management through the University of Arizona will cost $51,525. The program is promoted as completable in as little as 14 months.


  MBA Salary Benefits  

The result of an MBA is often to have greater skills, capabilities, and professional competency that will lead to a more successful career. Though an MBA results in a material short-term expense, the intention is to often recover this cover over time with a higher salary.



According to Glassdoor, an MBA at the end of 2021 received an average annual compensation package of roughly $106,000. Salary has historically been skewed towards degree holders with experience. Individuals with one year or less of experience earned less than $104,000 per year, while individuals with greater than 15 years of experience earned more than $144,000.



By comparison, MBA holders often make substantially more than undergraduate business majors. A 2019 study by William & Mary found MBA holders' salary was twice as high as Bachelor's degree holders.




What Does MBA Mean?
MBA stands for Masters of Business Administration. An MBA is an advanced degree that provides theoretical and practical training in business principles and leadership skills. MBA recipients obtain this postgraduate degree to further enhance their marketability as a professional.




What Is the Salary of an MBA?
As of December 2021, an MBA earns an estimated total pay of $106,000 per year. Pay is widely contingent on the industry, company, and underlying position occupied by the degree hold er. For example, the same salary data indicates a possible salary range between $45,000 to $518,000 per year for an MBA.




What Is an MBA Good for?
An MBA is good for two primary purposes. First, business professionals that obtain an MBA undergo a rigorous set of classes that improve the candidate's skillset. At the end of an MBA program, the MBA candidate should have learned new skills, expanded their network, better understand how to strategically approach problems, and be a more competent professional.In turn, the second primary benefit of an MBA is a higher degree of desirability with one's employer. Armed with a greater skillset, MBA candidates often have an advantage during job searches and may command higher pay. In general, possessing an MBA often makes an employee more desirable for a company to hire and retain.




What Are the Disadvantages of an MBA?
Obtaining an MBA is considered a very strenuous endeavor. For starters, MBAs are usually more difficult to get into. Candidates may find it demanding to compile a resume impressive enough to be accepted into their goal program. MBA programs may also be expensive. Not only is there is a considerable financial burden, MBA candidates may have to scale back or step away from work as they pursue their degree. Though an MBA carries substantial long-term value, there are several short-term hurdles a candidate must overcome.
What Is a Master of Public Administration (MPA)?  

A master of public administration (MPA) is a master's degree in public affairs that prepares recipients to serve in executive positions in municipal, state, and federal government and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs).



The program's focus centers on principles of public administration, policy development and management, and implementation of policies. It also prepares the candidate to deal with specific challenges faced in public administration.





Key Takeaways

An MPA is a master's degree in public affairs that prepares recipients of the degree to serve in executive-level government positions and nongovernmental organizations.The Master of Public Administration (MPA) is the public sector equivalent of an MBA.If you are interested in working globally, an MPA is a good choice.MPA candidates must possess a bachelor's degree from an accredited college or university.MPA graduates will often find jobs in upper-level management positions.


   Understanding the Master of Public Administration (MPA)  

A master of public administration (MPA) is considered the public sector equivalent of a master of business administration (MBA) degree in the private sector. It is also closely related to the more theoretical masters in public policy (MPP) degree. The MPP focuses on policy analysis and design, while the MPA focuses on program implementation. Many graduate schools offer a combined J.D. (law degree) and MPA; a few offer combined MBA/MPA programs.



As a professional level degree, the MPA requires students first to have an undergraduate level degree from eligible universities. Students enrolled in an MPA program are expected to possess above-average leadership skills and competence in economic and quantitative analysis, among other skill requirements.



Graduating with an MPA degree allows students to apply for work in various upper-management positions in the federal government, nonprofits, global NGOs, and private companies. MPA holders may find employment as public policy advocates and researchers, as well.


   Course Requirements  

MPA students are required to have a bachelor's degree from an accredited college or university; many graduate schools also require applicants to take the graduate records exam (GRE) before applying. Programs are interdisciplinary and include classes in economics, sociology, law, anthropology, and political science.



Most programs require two years for completion. Some executive MPA programs designed for experienced, mid-career professionals can be completed in one year. Also, a limited number of programs grant a doctor of public administration (D.P.A.), which is a terminal degree usually intended for research. The D.P.A. is considered on par with a Ph.D.






The pay for MPA-required jobs varies. For example, according to PayScale, the average starting salary for someone with an MPA is approximately $68,599. However, employment as a political scientist, which often requires an MPA, starts at an annual median salary of $122,510, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.


   Career Applications  

Graduates with an MPA degree are primed for leadership roles within private, public, and nonprofit agencies. Those who earn an MPA are often well-rounded in various areas, including policy, law, business, finance, and management.



Often, newly minted MPA graduates start as analysts, researchers, grant writers, and program managers, but these entry-level positions usually become executive positions. For those with experience and an MPA, there is a likelihood of being directly hired at a senior level.



Because MPA graduates usually possess a keen knowledge of policy and public affairs, plus an understanding of how policies impact business and economics, there are plenty of job opportunities in the private and nonprofit sectors.



Having an MPA offers opportunities to work with human rights groups, schools, nonprofit medical centers, charitable organizations, public media, such as radio and broadcasting, development groups, and international organizations, to name a few career paths.


   Advantages and Disadvantages of a Master of Public Administration  

Getting an MPA, like any advanced degree, takes time and money. If you decide to get an MPA, you will most likely take a variety of exciting courses. Unlike some master's programs, you don't need any particular undergraduate degree to be accepted into an MPA program.



Individuals with MPAs may graduate with multiple job opportunities in a broad spectrum of career paths. There are many advantages to getting an MPA beyond money and prestige, and earning an MPA often means enrolling in a variety of interesting courses, from international affairs to environmental law,



However, these jobs may be highly competitive, and public administrators may find themselves in high-stress jobs with low turnover rates. Executive positions are often not vacated until someone retires, especially if the pay and profile are high. High-profile positions in public administration mean working one-on-one with individuals and groups, so these jobs may be challenging for those who prefer to work independently or without drawing attention to themselves.





Pros

Provides entry into a variety of careers, including overseas
High-paying jobs
Studying for an MPA often means Interesting coursework.
You don't need a specific undergraduate degree to apply to an MPA program.




Cons

Getting your MPA may be expensive depending on the program.
Jobs that call for an MPA may mean long hours and high stress.
Highly competitive
Coursework to earn an MPA can be challenging.






   History of the Master of Public Administration  

The first master's degree program in public administration was established at the University of Michigan in 1914 as part of the Department of Political Science. The goal was to improve efficiency in municipal government and eliminate corruption. The program was developed by department chair Jesse S. Reeves, who later served as a technical adviser to the League of Nations Hague Conference in 1930. The program has since expanded to a full graduate school known as the Gerald R. Ford School of Public Policy.



The John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University and the Woodrow Wilson School of Government at Princeton University were founded in the middle of the Great Depression as part of a broader move to give the government and social services a scientific and professional grounding.



The New Deal programs of President Franklin Delano Roosevelt significantly increased the scope of the US government and its programs, creating a need for skilled, professional managers.


   MPA vs. MBA  

Trying to decide between getting an MPA versus an MBA degree will depend on whether or not you prefer studying business or public policy, although there is some crossover. Most graduates with an MBA work in finance in the private sector, and MPA graduates often end up in executive roles in nonprofits and government.



MBA graduates don't usually work on the policy side of finance and economics. In contrast, an MPA holder may work in the private sector studying the policies behind financial markets and why they succeed or fail. MPAs tend to work in organizations focused on improving the world, like nonprofits or non-governmental organizations.



Both MPA and MBA holders may find work abroad and will have (most likely) earned the credentials to work for global companies. Neither is a better degree than the other, and both can be useful in many different industries and job markets.




What Is the Salary of an MPA Degree?
The salary of someone who has an MPA degree depends on their job, but according to PayScale and Northeastern University, the average salary for someone with an MPA degree is $68,599.




What Jobs Do MPA Grads Get?
A graduate with an MPA will qualify for a job at a nonprofit, working for a federal or state government agency, a nongovernmental organization, or a private institution.




How Many Years Does It Take To Get an MPA?
It usually takes two years to earn an MPA degree. Some programs offer qualified and motivated students the option to complete an MPA in just one year.




What Is Taught In an MPA?
An MPA program often consists of coursework in law, international affairs, political theory, urban planning, nonprofit organizations, and public service leadership, among other subjects.


   The Bottom Line  

The Master of Public Administration (MPA) degree is a professionally-oriented graduate degree intended for students who wish to work in government agencies, nonprofits, NGOs, and other policy-related institutions. Coursework typically is centered around policy-making and analysis, public administration, organizational leadership, financial accounting, and research methods. MPA degrees are often a prerequisite for certain high-level policy or government jobs, and MPA programs are now offered by many of the top universities.
What Is Mastercard?  

Mastercard is the second-largest payments network, ranked behind Visa, in the global payments industry. Other major payments networks include American Express and Discover. Mastercard partners with member financial institutions all over the world to offer Mastercard-branded network payment cards.



Mastercard uses its proprietary global payments network, which it refers to as its core network, to facilitate payment transactions, which usually involve the Mastercard account holder and a merchant, along with their respective financial institutions. Payments can be made via credit, debit, or prepaid cards.





Key Takeaways

Mastercard is a payment network processor.Mastercard partners with financial institutions that issue Mastercard payment cards processed exclusively on the Mastercard network.Mastercard’s primary source of revenue comes from the fees that it charges issuers based on each card’s gross dollar volume.


   Mastercard Explained  

Mastercard itself is a financial services business that primarily generates revenue from gross dollar volume fees. Mastercard cards are issued by member banks with the Mastercard logo and are characterized as open loop. This means that the card can be used anywhere that the Mastercard brand is accepted.



Across the payments industry, there are four major payment card processors: Mastercard, Visa, American Express, and Discover. Each company operates a payments network and partners with a variety of institutions for card offerings.



All electronic payment cards have cardholder numbers that begin with an issuer identification number (IIN) that distinguishes the network processor for electronic payments. The IIN can help to identify the card brand if a logo is not visible.


   The Mastercard Business  

In 2020, Mastercard reported $6.3 trillion worth of gross dollar volume, which shows the amount of money comprehensively transacted on all of its card offerings. The company partners with a variety of institutions to offer several types of cards. Comprehensively, its card offerings include credit, debit, and prepaid cards. The majority of Mastercard’s business is through partnerships with financial institutions and their organizational co-brand partners to offer open-loop credit card options.



Mastercard does not have a banking division, as discussed in its 2020 Form 10-K filing:



We do not issue cards, extend credit, determine or receive revenue from interest rates or other fees charged to account holders by issuers, or establish the rates charged by acquirers in connection with merchants’ acceptance of our products.


  Branded and co-branded cards through financial institutions  

Mastercard partners with member financial institutions that, in turn, issue Mastercard-branded cards to consumers, students, and small businesses. Member financial institutions often partner with organizations in co-branded relationships to issue Mastercard-branded rewards cards to their customer bases. These organizations can include airlines, hotels, and retailers.



When Mastercard partners with a financial institution, the institution serves as the issuer. That institution determines the terms and benefits that a cardholder can receive on their card. A financial institution may choose to partner for the issuance of a credit card, debit card, or prepaid card.



To attract different types of consumers, financial institutions offer numerous features on Mastercard-branded cards. Some popular credit card features may include no annual fee, issuer-branded or custom organization–branded rewards points, cash back, and 0% introductory rates.



When credit, debit, and prepaid Mastercard cards are issued through partners, the financial institution is primarily responsible for all of the underwriting and issuance of the card.


   Mastercard Network Processing and Fees  

Cards within the Mastercard network have different relationship maps depending on the type of card offered and the agreements in place. Regardless, Mastercard charges fees for usage of each Mastercard.



Typically, the five entities involved in a transaction are the cardholders, merchants, acquiring banks, issuers, and Mastercard as the network processor. Fees can vary, depending on card and merchant agreements.



As a network processing service provider, Mastercard is responsible for the processing of a transaction. Mastercard may charge the issuer of a Mastercard a switching fee at the time of a card authorization, but generally, most fees involved with the transaction process are known as interchange fees and are negotiated between the issuer and the acquirer.


  Merchant discounts and issuers  

To accept Mastercard electronic payments, a merchant must have their own (acquiring) bank that is capable of receiving electronic payments on the Mastercard network. When a cardholder uses their Mastercard, the funds are routed from the cardholder’s (Mastercard-issuing) bank to the merchant’s bank account. The merchant pays the issuer a fee on each transaction, known as the merchant discount.



For Mastercard, the majority of the company’s revenue is generated from transaction fees charged to issuers and acquirers, which pay Mastercard based on gross dollar volume (GDV). The GDV fee is a percentage of the total GDV. Issuers also may be required to pay Mastercard a fee based on the co-branded card agreement. Each co-branded card agreement has different terms for fees, but in general, the GDV fee is a basic standard. Mastercard may also charge the issuer a switching fee for each card authorization, which can be a factor in determining the issuer’s interchange fee for the merchant.
What Are Matching Orders?  

Matching orders is the process by which a securities exchange pairs one or more unsolicited buy orders to one or more sell orders to make trades. This can be contrasted with requests for a quote (RFQ) in a security to proceed with a trade.



If one investor wants to buy a quantity of stock and another wants to sell the same quantity at the same price, their orders match, and a transaction is effected. The work of pairing these orders is the process of order matching whereby exchanges identify buy orders, or bids, with corresponding sell orders, or asks, to execute them. Over the past decade, this process has become almost entirely automated.





Key Takeaways

Matching orders is the process of identifying and effecting a trade between equal and opposite requests for a security (i.e., a buy and a sale at the same price).Order matching is how many exchanges pair buyers and sellers at compatible prices for efficient and orderly trading.Over the past decade, this process has become almost entirely automated.


   How Matching Orders Works  

Matching the orders of buyers and sellers is the primary work of specialists and market makers in the exchanges. The matches happen when compatible buy orders and sell orders for the same security are submitted in close proximity in price and time.



Generally, a buy order and a sell order are compatible if the maximum price of the buy order matches or exceeds the minimum price of the sell order. From there, the computerized, order-matching systems of different exchanges use a variety of methods to prioritize orders for matching.






Today, most exchanges match orders using computer algorithms; but historically, brokers matched orders through face-to-face interactions on a trading floor in an open-outcry auction.



Quick, accurate order matching is a critical component of an exchange. Investors, particularly active investors and day traders, will look for ways to minimize inefficiencies in trading from every possible source. A slow order-matching system may cause buyers or sellers to execute trades at less-than-ideal prices, eating into investors’ profits. If some order-matching protocols tend to favor buyers, and others favor sellers, these methods become exploitable.



This is one of the areas where high-frequency trading (HFT) was able to improve efficiency. Exchanges aim to prioritize trades in a way that benefits buyers and sellers equally so as to maximize order volume—the lifeblood of the exchange.


   Popular Algorithms for Matching Orders  

All major markets have transitioned to electronic matching. Each securities exchange uses its own specific algorithm to match orders. Broadly, they fall under two categories: first-in-first-out (FIFO) and pro-rata.


  FIFO  

Under a basic FIFO algorithm, or price-time-priority algorithm, the earliest active buy order at the highest price takes priority over any subsequent order at that price, which in turn takes priority over any active buy order at a lower price. For example, if a buy order for 200 shares of stock at $90 per share precedes an order for 50 shares of the same stock at the same price, the system must match the entire 200-share order to one or more sell orders before beginning to match any portion of the 50-share order.


  Pro-Rata  

Under a basic pro-rata algorithm, the system prioritizes active orders at a particular price, proportional to the relative size of each order. For example, if both a 200-share buy order and a 50-share buy order at the same price are active when a compatible 200-share sell order arrives, the system will match 160 shares to the 200-share buy order and 40 shares to the 50-share buy order.



Since the sell order is not large enough to fulfill both buy orders, the system will partially fill both. In this case, the pro-rata matching algorithm fills 80 percent of each order.
What Are Material Participation Tests?  

Material participation tests are a set of Internal Revenue Services (IRS) criteria that evaluate whether a taxpayer has materially participated in a trade, business, rental, or other income-producing activity. A taxpayer materially participates if they pass one of the seven material participation tests. However, passive activity rules limit the deductibility of losses when taxpayer participation fails to meet at least one of the seven material participation tests.





Key Takeaways

Material participation tests help determine whether a taxpayer has materially participated in business, rental, or other income-producing activity. A material participant can deduct the full amount of losses on their tax returns.Only one requirement of the seven material participation tests need to be met in order to qualify.Passive activity rules limit the deductibility of any passive loss.


   Understanding Material Participation Tests  

Material participation in an income-producing activity is, generally speaking, an activity that is regular, continuous, and substantial. Income-producing actions, in which the taxpayer materially participates is an active income or loss. An active loss is deductible but subject to at-risk rules or other limitations imposed by the Internal Revenue Code (IRC).



Passive activity rules apply to participation that fails to meet one of the material participation tests. A passive participation in an income-producing venture is participation that is not regular, continuous, and substantial. Income-producing actions, in which the taxpayer passively participates is passive income and loss. Passive activity rules limit the deductibility of any passive loss.






Material participation may or may not be worse than passive participation in any given situation. It is recommended that a financial advisor assists in making that decision.


   Types of Material Participation Tests  

For any tax year, a taxpayer, or their spouse, qualifies as materially participating in a venture if they satisfy any one of the seven material participation tests.



Test one: Participation for more than 500 hours.Test two: Activity that constituted all participation substantially.Test three: Involvement for more than 100 hours and no less than the participation of any other individual.Test four: Which is a significant participation activity, combined with all significant participation activities, for more than 500 hours. A significant participation activity is a business in which the taxpayer participates, without qualifying for any of the other six tests, for more than 100 hours.Test five: Participation during any five of the preceding ten taxable years.Test six: Which is a personal service activity for any three prior taxable years. Personal service activities are activities in which capital is not a material income-producing factor, such as health, law, engineering, architecture, accounting, actuarial science, performing arts, or consulting.Test seven: Partaking for more than 100 hours and based on all the facts and circumstances, on a regular, continuous, and substantial basis.


   Pros and Cons of Material Participation Tests  

Not all time spent in certain activities will count toward the 100-hour or 500-hour thresholds of Tests one, three, four, or seven.



Time spent as an investor will not count unless they can show direct involvement in the day-to-day management of the activity.﻿﻿ Work not customarily done by an owner is not counted towards material participation hours, nor is time spent commuting. Work undertaken for the primary purpose of avoiding the disallowance of losses under the passive loss rule is not material participation. And finally, participation in a purely managerial activity where other managers receive no compensation cannot be counted.



The participation of limited partners in enterprises owned by them is passive participation unless they pass material participation tests one, five, or six. When a taxpayer participates in two enterprises operated through the same pass-through entity, at least one of the seven tests for each venture must be met to be considered to have materially participated in both activities.


   Special Considerations for Material Participation Tests  

Taxpayers with an ownership interest in a venture receive participation credit for work done for it. By identifying the hours spent and the nature of work done, a taxpayer establishes their participation. A taxpayer bases participation on records they maintain, such as appointment books, calendars, narrative summaries, or any other reasonable means.




How Does the IRS See Active vs. Passive Participation In Generating Income?
So-called material participation in an activity that generates income is identified as active as it is determined to be regular, continuous, and substantial. This kind of participation must pass the material participation tests devised by the IRS. Passive participation that generates income is characterized as the opposite of active -- it's activity that is not regular, continuous, and substantial.




How Do You Verify Material Participation?
Taxpayers need to keep records of the number of hours of material participation in an activity, and be able to provide written evidence if need be. Tasks an investor might typically undertake, like reviewing stock charts, would not meet the participation burden, unless that taxpayer was substantially involved in the management of a particular activity. 




How Does Material Participation Impact Taxes?
A taxpayer who is materially participating in an activity is allowed to deduct the total amount of losses on their taxes. Under passive activity rules, a taxpayer who is passively participating in an income-generating activity is limited in the deductibility of losses.
What Is Material Requirements Planning (MRP)?  

Material requirements planning (MRP) is a software-based integrated inventory and supply management system designed for businesses.



Companies use MRP to estimate quantities of raw materials, maintain inventory levels, and schedule production and deliveries.





Key Takeaways

Material requirements planning (MRP) is the earliest computer-based inventory management system.MRP helps develop a production plan for finished goods by defining inventory requirements for components and raw materials.MRP assures that materials and components will be available when needed, minimizes inventory levels, reduces customer lead times, and improves customer satisfaction.MRP relies on data accuracy, has a high cost to implement, and maintains a strict production schedule.






   How Material Requirements Planning (MRP) Works  

MRP helps businesses and manufacturers define what is needed, how much is needed, and when materials are needed and works backward from a production plan for finished goods.



MRP converts a plan into a list of requirements for the subassemblies, parts, and raw materials needed to produce a final product within the established schedule. MRP helps manufacturers get a grasp of inventory requirements while balancing both supply and demand.



Using MRP, managers can determine their need for labor and supplies and improve their production efficiency by inputting data into the MRP scheme such as:



Item Name or Nomenclature: The finished good title, sometimes called Level "0" on BOM.Master Production Schedule (MPS): How much is required to meet demand? When is it needed?Shelf life of stored materials.Inventory Status File (ISF): Materials available that are in stock and materials on order from suppliers.Bills of materials (BOM): Details of materials and components required to make each product.Planning data: Restraints and directions like routing, labor and machine standards, quality and testing standards, and lot sizing techniques.


   MRP and Manufacturing  

Manufacturers manage the types and quantities of materials they purchase strategically and cost-effectively to ensure that they can meet current and future customer demand. MRP helps companies maintain appropriate levels of inventory so that manufacturers can better align their production with rising and falling demand.





BOM

A bill of materials (BOM) is an extensive list of raw materials, components, and assemblies required to construct, manufacture or repair a product or service.



The MRP process:



• Estimates demand and required materials. After determining customer demand and utilizing the bill of materials, MRP breaks down demand into specific raw materials and components.



• Allocates Inventory of materials. MRP allocates inventory into the exact areas as needed.



• Schedules Production. Time and labor requirements are calculated to complete manufacturing and a timeline is created.



• Monitors the process. MRP automatically alerts managers of any delays and even suggests contingency plans to meet build deadlines.


   History of MRP  

Material requirements planning was the earliest of the integrated information technology (IT) systems that aimed to improve productivity for businesses by using computers and software technology.



The first MRP systems of inventory management evolved in the 1940s and 1950s, using mainframe computers to extrapolate information from a bill of materials for a specific finished product into a production and purchasing plan. MRP systems expanded to include information feedback loops so that production managers could change and update the system inputs as needed.



The next generation of MRP, manufacturing resources planning (MRP II), also incorporated marketing, finance, accounting, engineering, and human resources aspects into the planning process. A concept that expands on MRP is enterprise resources planning (ERP), developed in the 1990s, which uses computer technology to link various functional areas across an entire business enterprise.


   Advantages and Disadvantages of MRP  



Pros

Materials and components are available when needed
Minimized inventory levels and associated costs
Reduced customer lead times
Increased manufacturing efficiency
Increased labor productivity



Cons

Heavy reliance on input data accuracy
Expensive to implement
Lack of flexibility in the production schedule
Tendency to hold more inventory than needed
Less capable than an overall ERP system





   MRP vs. ERP  

Enterprise resource planning (ERP) is an extension of MRP systems. While MRP is a planning and control system for the resources in a company, ERP is a solution for the enterprise as a whole and an ERP system includes advanced functionality in the areas of financial, customer relationships, and sales order management.



MRP can be a stand-alone application or a piece of an ERP, a single solution that addresses all business needs, not just the scheduling of resources. It decreases any information redundancies and adds elements, like user-level security.



Benefits of an ERP system include increased efficiency, integrated information, customized reports, and higher-quality customer service,




What Are the 3 Main Inputs for MRP?
The three basic inputs of an MRP system include the Master Production Schedule (MPS), Inventory Status File (ISF), and Bill of Materials (BOM).




How Does MRP Benefit a Business?
MRP ensures that materials and components are available when they're needed, inventory levels are optimized, manufacturing efficiency is improved, and customer satisfaction increases.




What Are the Outputs of an MRP System?
Using required inputs, the MRP calculates what materials are needed, how much is needed to complete a build, and exactly when materials are needed in the build process.This allows businesses to use just-in-time (JIT) production, scheduling production based on material availability. This minimizes inventory levels and businesses can move materials through the manufacturing process efficiently.


   The Bottom Line  

Material requirements planning (MRP) is a software-based integrated inventory and supply management system that companies use to estimate quantities of raw materials and schedule production. By inputting information like the Master Production Schedule, Inventory Status File, and the Bill of Materials (BOM), MRP calculates the materials needed, how much are needed, and when they are needed in the manufacturing process.
What Is a Mature Industry?  

A mature industry is one that has passed both the emerging and growth phases of industry growth. Companies in these industries tend to be larger, older, and more stable.



At the beginning of the industry lifecycle, new products or services find use in the marketplace. Many businesses may spring up trying to profit from the new product demand. Over time, failures and consolidations will distill the business to the strongest as the industry continues to grow. This is the period where the surviving companies are considered to be mature. Eventually, growth is predicted to slow as new innovative products or services replace existing industry offerings and begin a new industry lifecycle.





Key Takeaways

The mature industry phase is a later stage in the industry lifecycle.Mature industries tend to have larger, more established, and profitable companies than younger industries.At the start of the mature phase, there can be a shake-out separating successful from unsuccessful companies.In late maturity, companies may begin to consolidate as organic growth slows and they look for ways to increase their market share and juice their growth.


   Understanding a Mature Industry  

The maturity phase of the industry lifecycle often begins with a shakeout period, during which growth slows, focus shifts toward expense reduction, and consolidation occurs. Some firms achieve economies of scale, hampering the sustainability of smaller competitors. As maturity is achieved, barriers to entry become higher, and the competitive landscape becomes more clear.



Market share, cash flow, and profitability become the primary goals of the remaining mature companies once growth is relatively less important. Price competition becomes much more relevant as product differentiation declines with consolidation. Examples of mature industries in the U.S. today include food and agriculture, mining and natural resources extraction, and financial services.






The shares of mature industries are characterized by low price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios and high dividend yields.



Earnings and sales grow slower in mature industries than during the growth and emerging industries phases. A mature industry may be at its peak or just past it but not yet in the decline phase. While earnings may be stable, growth prospects are few and far between as the remaining companies consolidate market share and create barriers for new competitors to enter the sphere.

   Why a Mature Industry May See Little Growth  

In a mature industry, revenue and earnings can continue to increase. However, companies from such industries are not expected to grow at the same pace that may have characterized the earlier phases of development. This may be due to the industry already approaching the point of market saturation in terms of reaching available customers.



For example, the makers of breakfast cereal and related grocery products could be considered to be part of a mature industry. Such companies have achieved a level of market penetration that may shift marginally from time to time, but they have largely reached the limits of the demographics they want to reach. Each company may have a footprint of customers it has connected with, though there may be some gaps in coverage. As a collective industry, such companies have the capacity to cover the gamut of available clientele.



Mature industries can pose a challenge for investors and the management of the companies in these sectors. While there is an expectation of stability that comes with a mature industry, a desire to see future earnings growth persists.



In order for companies in mature industries to realize growth that might appease investors, significant effort must be made. This can include researching and developing new products that change the paradigm of the industry. It might consist of selling off parts of the business, acquiring assets from smaller, more innovative companies, or merging with a peer company to further expand the company’s customer base and market presence.



Mature industries can be seen as having plateaued in some regards and may need to develop new innovations to remain relevant with their customers. It may be inevitable for mature industries to be superseded and made obsolete by the growth of a new business sector.



For example, film photography was once a mature and stable industry given there were few true alternatives to the medium until digital photography reached a stage of development that could consistently reproduce, at a comparable cost, the clarity of film photos. While there are nuanced reasons why film photography remains popular with some niche users, the consumer market largely shifted to using digital.
What Is Maturity?  

Maturity is the date on which the life of a transaction or financial instrument ends, after which it must either be renewed or it will cease to exist. The term is commonly used for deposits, foreign exchange spot trades, forward transactions, interest rate and commodity swaps, options, loans, and fixed income instruments such as bonds.



Financial institutions sometimes temporarily alter maturity dates as part of a promotion to entice new investors. For promotional certificates of deposits (CDs), a bank may offer a higher rate of return for a short-term CD. At maturity, the promotional CD will generally renew at the rate and time frame of a standard CD.





Key Takeaways

Maturity is the agreed-upon date on which the investment ends, often triggering the repayment of a loan or bond, the payment of a commodity or cash payment, or some other payment or settlement term.It's a term that is most commonly used in relation to bonds but is also used for deposits, currencies, interest rate and commodity swaps, options, loans, and other transactions.The maturity date for loans and other debt can change repeatedly throughout the lifetime of a loan, should a borrower renew the loan, default, incur higher interest fees, or pay off the total debt early.Nonpayment of a bond at maturity could result in the issuer defaulting on the obligation, which would then negatively impact the issuer's credit rating and ability to raise funds through future bond offerings.


   Understanding Maturity  

Some financial instruments, such as deposits and loans, require repayment of principal and interest on the maturity date. Others, such as foreign exchange (forex) transactions, provide for the delivery of a commodity. Still others, such as interest rate swaps, consist of a series of cash flows with the final one occurring at maturity.


   Maturity of a Deposit  

The maturity of a deposit is the date on which the principal is returned to the investor. Interest is sometimes paid periodically during the lifetime of the deposit, or at maturity. Many interbank deposits are overnight, including most euro deposits, and a maturity of more than 12 months is rare.


   Maturity of Bonds  

At the maturity of a fixed-income investment such as a bond, the borrower is required to repay the full amount of the outstanding principal plus any applicable interest to the lender. Nonpayment at maturity may constitute default, which would negatively affect the issuer's credit rating.



Term to maturity refers to the amount of time during which the bond owner will receive interest payments on their investment. Bonds with a longer term to maturity will generally offer a higher interest rate. Once the bond reaches maturity, the bond owner will receive the face value (also referred to as "par value") of the bond from the issuer and interest payments will cease.


   Maturity of Derivatives  

The term maturity can also be used concerning derivative instruments such as options and warrants, but it's important to distinguish maturity from the expiration date. For an option, the expiration date is the last date on which an American-style option can be exercised, and the only date that a European-style option can be exercised.



The maturity date is the date on which the underlying transaction settles if the option is exercised. The maturity or expiration date of a stock warrant is the last date that it can be exercised to purchase the underlying stock at the strike price.






The maturity on an interest rate swap is the settlement date of the final set of cash flows.


   Maturity of Foreign Exchange  

The maturity date (also known as the value date) of a spot foreign exchange transaction is two business days, with the exception of U.S. dollar versus Canadian dollar transactions, which settle on the next business day. The maturity date on a foreign exchange forward or swap is the date on which the final exchange of currencies takes place. It can be anything longer than the spot.


   Special Considerations  

The maturity of an investment is a primary consideration for investors since it has to match their investment horizon. An investment horizon can potentially range from as short as a few days to decades, depending on how long the investor intends to hold the investment in order to achieve their objectives.



For example, homebuyers who are saving money for the down payment on a home that they intend to purchase within a year would be ill-advised to invest in a five-year term deposit. A better alternative in this scenario would be to consider a money market fund or a one-year term deposit.
What Is a Maturity Date?  

A maturity date is the date on which the principal amount of a note, draft, acceptance bond, or other debt instrument becomes due. It also refers to the termination or due date on which an installment loan must be paid back in full. As such, the relationship between the debtor and creditor or the investor and debt issuer ends. The maturity date can be found on the certificate of the instrument. The principal investment is repaid to the investor on the maturity date and regular interest payments made to them cease on this date.





Key Takeaways

The principal of a fixed-income instrument must be repaid to an investor when the instrument reaches its maturity date.The maturity date also refers to the due date on which a borrower must pay back an installment loan in full.The maturity date is used to classify bonds into three main categories: short-term, medium-term, and long-term.Once the maturity date is reached, the debt agreement no longer exists and any interest payments regularly paid to investors cease.Issuers of callable securities may pay off the principal balance before the maturity date.


   How Maturity Dates Work  

Although investing and borrowing may be different, there are some commonalities between these two ventures. One of these is what's called a maturity date which is the date at which the relationship between the investor and issuer, and the borrower and creditor ends.



A maturity date defines the lifespan of a security or loan, informing investors and creditors when they receive their principal back. For instance:



A two-year certificate of deposit (CD) has a maturity date of 24 months from when it was established, which means that the issuer repays the principal balance to the investor.
A 30-year mortgage has a maturity date of three decades from when it was issued, by which point the borrower has repaid the balance in full.



The maturity date also defines the period of time in which investors receive interest payments. For derivative contracts such as futures or options, the term maturity date is sometimes used to refer to the contract's expiration date.



It is important to note that some debt instruments, such as fixed-income securities, are often callable. For callable securities, including callable bonds, issuers maintain the right to pay back the principal before its maturity date. Before buying any fixed-income securities, investors should determine whether the bonds are callable or not.






With callable fixed income securities, the debt issuer can elect to pay back the principal early, which can prematurely halt interest payments made to investors.


   Special Considerations  

Bonds with longer terms to maturity tend to offer higher coupon rates (the annual amount of interest paid to the bondholder) than similar-quality bonds with shorter terms to maturity.



The risk of the government or a corporation defaulting on the loan increases over longer periods of time. Additionally, the inflation rate grows higher over time. These factors must be incorporated into the rates of return fixed-income investors receive.






A bond's price grows less volatile the closer it comes to maturity.


   Types of Maturity Dates  

Maturity dates are used to classify bonds and other types of securities into one of the following three broad categories:



Short-Term: These are bonds that mature in one to three years
Medium-Term: With these bonds, maturity takes place in 10 or more years
Long-Term: These bonds mature after longer periods of time. A common instrument of this type is a 30-year Treasury bond. At its time of issue, this bond begins extending interest payments, generally every six months, until the 30-year bond matures.



This classification system is used widely across the finance industry. This means that the maturity dates of bonds, CDs, and debts (like loans and mortgages) can all be either short-term, medium-term, or long-term.


   Example of a Maturity Date  

Here's a hypothetical example to show how maturity dates work. Let's say an investor bought a 30-year Treasury bond in 1996 with a maturity date of May 26, 2016. Using the Consumer Price Index (CPI) as the metric, the hypothetical investor experienced an increase in U.S. prices, or rate of inflation, of over 218% during the time he held the security.



As a bond grows closer to its maturity date, its yield to maturity (YTM), which is the anticipated return on the bond at maturity, and coupon rate begin to converge. Once the bond matures, the investor receives the full principal balance back and the investment is considered closed.




How Do You Determine a Bond's Maturity Date?
The bond documents will include a lot of information, including the final maturity date. Typically, investors can find the final maturity date in the Authorization, Authentication, and Delivery section of the bond documents.




How Does the Maturity Date Affect the Interest Rate of a Bond?
Bonds with longer terms tend to offer higher interest rates. This higher interest rate goes hand in hand with additional risks for investors.




What Happens if a Company Defaults on its Bonds?
If a company goes bankrupt and defaults on its bonds, bondholders have a claim on that company's assets. But the type of bond, whether that's secured or unsecured, will determine the priority of a bondholder's claim. A company going through bankruptcy will also have other creditors. Ultimately, claims on the company's assets will be sifted through in bankruptcy court.


   The Bottom Line  

The maturity date of a bond or other debt instrument determines when the principal investment is repaid to investors. At this point, interest payments made to investors stop. Conservative investors may appreciate the clear time table outlining when their principal will be paid back. When used in the context of loans, a maturity date refers to the time when the borrower must pay back a loan in full.
What Is Max Pain?  

Max pain, or the max pain price, is the strike price with the most open options contracts (i.e., puts and calls), and it is the price at which the stock would cause financial losses for the largest number of option holders at expiration.



The term max pain stems from the maximum pain theory, which states that most traders who buy and hold options contracts until expiration will lose money.





Key Takeaways

Max pain, or the max pain price, is the strike price with the most open contract puts and calls and the price at which the stock would cause financial losses for the largest number of option holders at expiration.The Maximum Pain theory states that an option's price will gravitate towards a max pain price, in some cases equal to the strike price for an option, that causes the maximum number of options to expire worthless.Max pain calculation involves the summation of the dollar values of outstanding put and call options for each in-the-money strike price.


   Understanding Max Pain  

According to the maximum pain theory, the price of an underlying stock tends to gravitate towards its "maximum pain strike price"—the price where the greatest number of options (in dollar value) will expire worthless.



Maximum pain theory says that the option writers will hedge the contracts they have written. In the case of the market maker, the hedging is done to remain neutral in the stock. Consider the market maker's position if they must write an option contract without wanting a position in the stock.



As the option expiration approaches, option writers will try to buy or sell shares of stock to drive the price toward a closing price that is profitable for them, or at least to hedge their payouts to option holders. For instance, call writers will want the share price to go down while put writers would like to see share prices go up.



About 60% of options are traded out, 30% of options expire worthless, and 10% of options are exercised. Max pain is the point where option owners (buyers) feel "maximum pain," or will stand to lose the most money. Option sellers, on the other hand, may stand to reap the most rewards.



The maximum pain theory is controversial. Critics of the theory are divided whether the tendency for the underlying stock's price to gravitate towards the maximum pain strike price is a matter of chance or a case of market manipulation.


   Calculating the Max Pain Point  

Max pain is a simple but time consuming calculation. Essentially, it is the sum of the outstanding put and call dollar value of each in-the-money strike price.



For each in-the-money strike price for both puts and calls:



Find the difference between stock price and strike priceMultiply the result by open interest at that strikeAdd together the dollar value for the put and call at that strikeRepeat for each strike priceFind the highest value strike price. This price is equivalent to max pain price.



Because the max pain price can change daily, if not from hour to hour, using it as a trading tool is not easy. However, it is sometimes valuable to note when there is a large difference between the current stock price and the max pain price. There could be a tendency for the stock to move closer to max pain, but the effects may not be meaningful until expiration approaches.


   Example of Max Pain  

For example, suppose options of stock ABC are trading at a strike price on $48. However, there is significant open interest on ABC options at strike prices of $51 and $52. Then the max pain price will settle at either one of these two values because they will cause the maximum number of ABC's options to expire worthless.



Correction, Jan. 16, 2022: A previous version of this article mistakenly stated that put holders want share prices to go up. In fact, put holders profit from lower share prices, while put writers profit from higher ones.
What Is a Maximum Drawdown (MDD)?  

A maximum drawdown (MDD) is the maximum observed loss from a peak to a trough of a portfolio, before a new peak is attained. Maximum drawdown is an indicator of downside risk over a specified time period.



It can be used both as a stand-alone measure or as an input into other metrics such as "Return over Maximum Drawdown" and the Calmar Ratio. Maximum Drawdown is expressed in percentage terms.

   Understanding Maximum Drawdown  

Maximum drawdown is a specific measure of drawdown that looks for the greatest movement from a high point to a low point, before a new peak is achieved. However, it's important to note that it only measures the size of the largest loss, without taking into consideration the frequency of large losses. Because it measures only the largest drawdown, MDD does not indicate how long it took an investor to recover from the loss, or if the investment even recovered at all.



Maximum drawdown (MDD) is an indicator used to assess the relative riskiness of one stock screening strategy versus another, as it focuses on capital preservation, which is a key concern for most investors. For example, two screening strategies can have the same average outperformance, tracking error, and volatility, but their maximum drawdowns compared to the benchmark can be very different.



A low maximum drawdown is preferred as this indicates that losses from investment were small. If an investment never lost a penny, the maximum drawdown would be zero. The worst possible maximum drawdown would be -100%, meaning the investment is completely worthless.



MDD should be used in the right perspective to derive the maximum benefit from it. In this regard, particular attention should be paid to the time period being considered. For instance, a hypothetical long-only U.S. fund Gamma has been in existence since 2000 and had a maximum drawdown of -30% in the period ending 2010. While this may seem like a huge loss, note that the S&P 500 had plunged more than 55% from its peak in October 2007 to its trough in March 2009. While other metrics would need to be considered to assess Gamma fund's overall performance, from the viewpoint of MDD, it has outperformed its benchmark by a huge margin.





Key Takeaways

Maximum drawdown (MDD) is a measure of an asset's largest price drop from a peak to a trough.Maximum drawdown is considered to be an indicator of downside risk, with large MDDs suggesting that down movements could be volatile.While MDD measures the largest loss, it does not account for the frequency of losses, not the size of any gains.


   Example of Maximum Drawdown  

Consider an example to understand the concept of maximum drawdown. Assume an investment portfolio has an initial value of $500,000. The portfolio increases to $750,000 over a period of time, before plunging to $400,000 in a ferocious bear market. It then rebounds to $600,000, before dropping again to $350,000. Subsequently, it more than doubles to $800,000. What is the maximum drawdown?

Note the following points:



The initial peak of $750,000 is used in the MDD calculation. The interim peak of $600,000 is not used, since it does not represent a new high.The new peak of $800,000 is also not used since the original drawdown began from the $750,000 peak.The MDD calculation takes into consideration the lowest portfolio value ($350,000 in this case) before a new peak is made, and not just the first drop to $400,000.
What Is Maximum Foreseeable Loss (MFL)?  

The maximum foreseeable loss is an insurance term most frequently used in the insurance of businesses and business property. MFL is a worst-case situation in which the claim for damages and losses are significant.



The maximum foreseeable loss is a reference to the most substantial financial hit a policyholder could potentially experience when an insured property has been harmed or destroyed by an adverse event, such as a fire. Maximum foreseeable loss assumes a malfunction and non-response of the usual safeguards, like sprinklers and professional firefighters, that would typically limit such a loss.





Key Takeaways

Maximum Foreseeable Loss (MFL) is an insurance term usually applied to the protection of a business or business property.MFL is a reference to a worst-case scenario, the largest hit a policyholder could experience if the insured property has been harmed or destroyed.Typically, the damage comes from an adverse event, including fires, tornados, hurricanes, or other kinds of natural disasters.


   Claiming Maximum Foreseeable Losses  

A claim for a maximum foreseeable loss is extensive, as it will include not just physical losses, such as the property housing the business and the products, supplies, and equipment owned by the company, but also the impact the adverse event had on the day-to-day running of the operations.



The policy acknowledges the potential loss of business, called business interruption, which is likely unavoidable while repairs to the property are ongoing. Depending on the size of the property and the extent of the business, repairs could take weeks or months. The business interruption might be complete (100%) or partial (say, 50%) depending on whether it’s possible to resume business at another physical location or in some cases, digitally. The maximum foreseeable loss refers to the worst-case scenario that a company might potentially face should an adverse event occur.


   MFL and Other Loss Determinations  

Insurers use a maximum foreseeable loss for underwriting policies for insurance coverage. Besides MFL, the insurance underwriter considers probable maximum loss and usual loss expectancy for the typical business types. For example, the maximum foreseeable loss for the owner of a warehouse who experiences a fire, hurricane, or tornado is the full value of the warehouse building and all of its contents.



Common sense suggests most owners would seek such coverage. However, the owner of the warehouse also typically chooses to protect the business in the event of less all-encompassing damage, such as water damage of products after a roof leak. Other thresholds which can reflect the impact of smaller, yet still detrimental, losses to the company


   Probable and Normal Loss Expectancy  

The probable maximum loss (PML) is a lower financial figure that assumes part of the physical structure, and some of the contents of the warehouse are salvageable. That's because the building’s passive safeguards partially limited the damage, but the most critical active one did not.



A smaller allowance would be the normal loss expectancy, the highest claim a company can file for property damage and business interruption from an adverse event like a fire. It is a best-case loss scenario. Normal loss expectancy assumes that all protection systems worked correctly, and the damage is limited to 10% of the property’s insured value.


   Determining MFL  

The percentage of the property’s total insured value at risk to be decimated by a particular type of loss varies with each policy based on factors which include building construction, the combustibility of the building's contents, the ease with which the contents may be damaged, and existing firefighting services in the immediate area.



Calculating different loss estimates is essential in helping insurers determine how much coverage their clients need to purchase and how much the insurers are at risk of paying out under different types of claims.


   MFL Example  

Let's say a retailer had a crucial warehouse that held the majority of its offerings. The retailer knows that it needs to be fully stocked ahead of a critical holiday shopping season and is depending on the contents of this warehouse to satisfy its customers and help it capitalize on consumer spending.



If anything happens to this warehouse, it would be a huge blow to the retailer. Not only would the retailer have lost inventory it already paid for, but they would also experience a business interruption resulting from the destruction of its inventory, its inability to fulfill customer orders, and its inability to take advantage of the holiday shopping period.



The maximum foreseeable loss in this scenario is that a fire or natural disaster destroys the warehouse ahead of a major shopping event. The destruction of the warehouse would cause a massive business interruption that would substantially damage the company's results, not to mention hurt its reputation with consumers in the long run. As a result, purchasing insurance in anticipation of the maximum foreseeable loss would be essential for the retailer.
What Is the Maximum Loan Amount?  

A maximum loan amount, or loan limit, describes the total amount of money that an applicant is authorized to borrow. Maximum loan amounts are used for standard loans, credit cards, and line-of-credit accounts.



The maximum will depend on several factors including a borrower's creditworthiness, length of the loan, loan purpose, whether the loan is backed by collateral, as well as various criteria of the lender.





Key Takeaways

A maximum loan amount describes the total sum that one is authorized to borrow on a line of credit, credit card, personal loan, or mortgage.In determining an applicant's maximum loan amount, lenders consider debt-to-income ratio, credit score, credit history, and financial profile.Various types of loans—government-sponsored, unsecured, and secured—have different requirements; however, most lenders generally seek borrowers with debt-to-income ratios of 36% or less.


   Understanding the Maximum Loan Amount  

A maximum loan amount for a borrower is based on a combination of factors and determined by a loan underwriter. It is the maximum amount of money that will be provided to a borrower if the loan is approved. Lenders consider a borrower’s debt-to-income ratio during the underwriting process, which helps to determine how much they believe the borrower would be able to repay and therefore what the maximum loan amount should be. Lenders generally seek borrowers with debt-to-income ratios of 36% or less.



Lenders must also consider their own risk parameters when determining a borrower’s total principal. Thus, maximum loan amounts can also be based on the risk diversification of a lender.






In addition to the applicant's debt-to-income ratio, underwriters take into account a variety of factors, including credit score and credit history, in determining the maximum loan amount an applicant can borrow.


   Unsecured Lending  

Credit cards are an example of unsecured lending. Credit card issuers also use underwriting to determine how much they trust a borrower to repay—the maximum loan amount or credit limit. One of the primary factors they consider is credit history, which includes repayment history, the number of credit accounts on a report, and the length of a person's credit history. Credit card issuers will also check the number of inquiries on a credit report and the derogatory marks, which include bankruptcies, collections, civil judgments, and tax liens. They also may take into account an applicant's work history.



Personal loans are also available unsecured. Banks, peer-to-peer (P@P) websites, and other lenders use credit history, debt-to-income ratio, and other types of underwriting to set the rates at which they are willing to lend money. The better your credit rating, the better the rates you will be offered; people with excellent credit are offered much lower rates than those with bad credit.



Personal lines of credit (LOC) are another form of unsecured loan, which give you access to an amount of money that you can borrow when you need it—and there's no interest until you borrow. Having better credit scores may help you qualify for a lower annual percentage rate.


   Secured Lending  

With secured loans—specifically mortgage loans—lenders use an additional qualifying ratio called the housing expense ratio, which compares the borrower's housing expenses to their pre-tax income. Housing expenses generally include the potential mortgage principal and interest payments, property taxes, hazard insurance, mortgage insurance, and association fees. Lenders will typically look for a housing expense ratio no higher than 28%. Similar to standard loans, secured lenders will also analyze a borrower’s debt-to-income with 36% being the common threshold required.



They also base a maximum loan amount on customized loan-to-value thresholds. Secured lenders will often lend between 70%-90% of a secured asset’s collateral value. Mortgage loans generally follow standard underwriting procedures with these variables also a part of the decision on how much to lend to a borrower.



A home-equity line of credit (HELOC) is another form of secured lending. As its name implies, the maximum loan amount is based on the equity you have in your home. If you need money, it can be a better choice than a credit card because the interest rate may be lower and the amount you can borrow higher. If you have trouble paying back what you borrow, however, you can risk losing your home.


   Government-Sponsored Loans  

Government-sponsored loans offer some exceptions to the underwriting requirements and maximum loan amounts for certain types of home loans. These loans may accept borrowers with debt-to-income ratios of up to 50%. In the mortgage industry, the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) publishes the maximum amounts for loans sponsored by Fannie Mae. Freddie Mac also publishes loan limits annually. Since Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac guarantee a large percentage of mortgages originated in the United States, the "conforming loan limit"—that is, loans that conform to these entities' guidelines—is an important number in the mortgage finance industry.





$647,200

The maximum conforming loan limit for one-unit properties in most parts of the U.S. The limit increased from $548,250 in 2021.
What Is the McClellan Oscillator?  

The McClellan Oscillator is a market breadth indicator that is based on the difference between the number of advancing and declining issues on a stock exchange, such as the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) or NASDAQ.



The indicator is used to show strong shifts in sentiment in the indexes, called breadth thrusts. It also helps in analyzing the strength of an index trend via divergence or confirmation.















TradingView.





Key Takeaways


The McClellan Oscillator formula can be applied to any stock exchange or group of stocks.
A reading above zero helps confirm a rise in the index, while readings below zero confirm a decline in the index.
When the index is rising but the oscillator is falling, that warns that the index could start declining too. When the index is falling and the oscillator is rising, that indicates the index could start rising soon. This is called divergence.
A significant change, such as moving 100 points or more, from a negative reading to a positive reading is called a breadth thrust. It may indicate a strong reversal from downtrend to uptrend is underway on the stock exchange.



   The Formula for the McClellan Oscillator is  

There are two formulas for the McClellan oscillator. The original formula, and one that adjusts for changes in the number of stocks listed on the stock exchange. The adjusted formula allows for a better comparison of values over longer periods of time.

  How to Calculate the McClellan Oscillator  

To get the calculation started, track Advances - Declines on a stock exchange for 19 and 39 days. Calculate a simple average for these, not exponential moving average (EMA).
Use these simple values as the Prior Day EMA values in the 19- and 39-day EMA formulas.
Calculate the 19- and 39-day EMAs.
Calculate the McClellan Oscillator value.
Now that the value has been calculated, on the next calculation use this value for the Prior Day EMA. Start calculating EMAs for the formula instead of simple averages.
If using the adjusted formula, the steps are the same, except use ANA instead of using Advances - Declines.


   What Does the McClellan Oscillator Tell You?  

The McClellan Oscillator is an indicator based on market breadth which technical analysts can use in conjunction with other technical tools to determine the overall state of the stock market and assess the strength of its current trend.



Since the indicator is based on all the stocks in an exchange, it is compared to the price movements of indexes that reflect that exchange, or compared to major indexes such as the S&P 500.



Positive and negative values indicate whether more stocks, on average, are advancing or declining. The indicator is positive when the 19-day EMA is above the 39-day EMA, and negative when the 19-day EMA is below the 39-day EMA.



A positive and rising indicator suggests that stocks on the exchange are being accumulated. A negative and falling indicator signals that stocks are being sold. Typically such action confirms the current trend in the index.



Crossovers from positive to negative, or vice versa, may signal the trend has changed in the index or exchange being tracked. When the indicator makes a large move, typically of 100 points or more, from negative to positive territory, that is called a breadth thrust. It means a large number of stocks moved up after a bearish move. Since the stock market tends to rise over time, this a positive signal and may indicate that a bottom in the index is in and prices are heading higher overall.



When index prices and the indicator are moving in different directions, then the current index trend may lack strength. Bullish divergence occurs when the oscillator is rising while the index is falling. This indicates the index could head higher soon since more stocks are starting to advance.



Bearish divergence is when the index is rising and the indicator is falling. This means fewer stocks are keeping the advance going and prices may start to head lower.


   The Difference Between the McClellan Oscillator and McClellan Summation Index?  

The McClellan Oscillator was developed by Sherman and Marian McClellan, who also developed the McClellan Summation Index. The McClellan Summation Index adds the current day's McClellan Oscillator to the previous day's McClellan Summation Index. In other words, the Summation Index is a cumulative measure, whereas the oscillator is not. While the oscillator may be more useful for analyzing shorter-term trends, the Summation Index is more applicable to broader and longer-term price trends.


   Limitations of Using the McClellan Oscillator  

The indicator tends to produce lots of signals. Breadth thrusts, divergence, and crossovers all occur with some frequency, but not all these signals will result in the price/index moving in the expected direction. The indicator is prone to producing false signals and therefore should be used in conjunction with price action analysis and other technical indicators.



The indicator can also be quite choppy, moving between positive and negative territory rapidly. Such action indicates a choppy market, but this isn't evident until the indicator has made this whipsaw move a few times.



Study how the indicator acts over extended periods of time and in different market conditions before relying on the indicator for trading purposes.
What Is MCF?  

MCF is an abbreviation derived from the Roman numeral M for one thousand, put together with cubic feet (CF) to measure a quantity of natural gas. For example, a natural gas well that produces 400 MCF of gas per day operates with a daily production rate of 400,000 cubic feet. In terms of energy output, one thousand cubic feet (MCF) of gas is equal to approximately 1,000,000 BTU (British Thermal Units). One BTU is the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit at sea level (which is roughly equivalent to a kitchen match).



Many people mistakenly think that M represents the English word for million, but that is not the case. One million cubic feet of gas is instead denoted as MMCF, in which the two Ms mean "one thousand thousand" or 1,000,000, with each M representing three zeros.

MCF is an abbreviation that combines the Roman numeral M, as a stand-in for the number one-thousand, with the term cubic feet (CF).MCF is a conventional natural gas measurement that is used primarily in the United States, where the imperial measuring system is standard.The comparable term for natural gas measurement in Europe, where the metric system is used, is MCM.


   Understanding MCF  

MCF is the conventional way to measure natural gas in the United States, which uses the imperial measuring system. In Europe, where the metric system is used, the abbreviation most commonly used is thousand of cubic meters or MCM. Oil and gas financial analysts need to be especially careful when analyzing companies' quarterly results to avoid mixing up various units. For example, it is quite easy to overlook the fact that U.S. companies will report natural gas measurements in MCF, while European companies often report them in MCM. This makes quite a difference because 1 MCM = 35.3 MCF.



To help analysts deal with these reporting differences, some companies provide analysts with an approximate conversion factor guide. In these guides, there are typically six specific conversion factors for natural gas (cubic meters, cubic feet, tons of oil equivalent, tons of liquefied natural gas, BTU, and barrels of oil equivalent).


   Special Considerations  

​Most of the major international oil and gas companies provide standardized reports to help analysts and investors accurately assess these figures. This is partly a regulatory requirement, with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) stipulating that foreign companies with stock listed on U.S. exchanges file standardized reports on an annual basis, called a 20-F. This is equivalent to the 10-K filing for U.S. companies and provides investors with oil and gas production and reserve statistics published with imperial measurements to allow like-for-like comparison.



Investors in the emerging markets of Russia, Africa, or Latin America often receive reports with data represented in the metric system, which is a global measurement system. Analysts of these companies will need to use conversion tables to accurately quantify and compare them to more sophisticated international operators.
What Is the McKinsey 7S Model?  

The McKinsey 7S Model is a framework for organizational effectiveness that postulates that there are seven internal factors of an organization that need to be aligned and reinforced in order for it to be successful.





Key Takeaways

The McKinsey 7S Model is an organizational tool that assesses the well-being and future success of a company.It looks to seven internal factors of an organization as a means of determining whether a company has the structural support to be successful.The model comprises a mix of hard elements, which are clear-cut and influenced by management, and soft elements, which are fuzzier and influenced by corporate culture.


   Understanding McKinsey 7S Model  

The 7S Model specifies seven factors that are classified as "hard" and "soft" elements. Hard elements are easily identified and influenced by management, while soft elements are fuzzier, more intangible, and influenced by corporate culture. The hard elements are as follows:



Strategy
Structure
Systems



The soft elements are as follows:



Shared valuesSkillsStyleStaff



The framework is used as a strategic planning tool by organizations to show how seemingly disparate aspects of a company are, in fact, interrelated and reliant upon one another to achieve overall success.






Consultants Thomas Peters and Robert Waterman Jr., authors of the management bestseller "In Search Of Excellence," conceived of the McKinsey 7S Model at consulting firm McKinsey & Co. in the late 1970s.


   A Closer Look at the 7 S's  

The strategy is the plan deployed by an organization in order to remain competitive in its industry and market. An ideal approach is to establish a long-term strategy that aligns with the other elements of the model and clearly communicates what the organization’s objective and goals are.
The structure of the organization is made up of its corporate hierarchy, the chain of command, and divisional makeup that outlines how the operations function and interconnect. In effect, it details the management configuration and responsibilities of workers.
Systems of the company refer to the daily procedures, workflow, and decisions that make up the standard operations within the organization.
Shared values are the commonly accepted standards and norms within the company that both influence and temper the behavior of the entire staff and management. This may be detailed in company guidelines presented to the staff. In practice, shared values relate to the actual accepted behavior within the workplace.
Skills comprise the talents and capabilities of the organization’s staff and management, which can determine the types of achievements and work the company can accomplish. There may come a time when a company assesses its available skills and decides it must make changes in order to achieve the goals set forth in its strategy.
Style speaks to the example and approach that management takes in leading the company, as well as how this influences performance, productivity, and corporate culture.
Staff refers to the personnel of the company, how large the workforce is, where their motivations reside, as well as how they are trained and prepared to accomplish the tasks set before them.



The McKinsey 7-S Model is applicable in a wide variety of situations where it's useful to understand how the various parts of an organization work together. It can be used as a tool to make decisions on future corporate strategy.



The framework can also be used to examine the likely effects of future changes in the organization or to align departments and processes during a merger or acquisition. Elements of the McKinsey Model 7s can also be used with individual teams or projects.

What Is Mean Reversion?  

The concept of mean reversion is widely used in various financial time series data, including price, earnings and book value. When an asset's current market price is less than its average past price, it's considered attractive for purchase. Conversely, if the current price is above the average, it's expected to fall. Traders and investors use mean reversion for timing of their respective trading and investment strategies.





Key Takeaways

Mean reversion, in finance, suggests that various phenomena of interest such as asset prices and volatility of returns eventually revert to their long-term average levels.The mean reversion theory has led to many investment strategies, from stock trading techniques to options pricing models.Mean reversion trading tries to capitalize on extreme changes in the price of a particular security, assuming that it will revert to its previous state.Some technical analysis mean reversion tools include moving averages, the RSI, bollinger bands, the stochastic oscillator and the MACD.


   Understanding Mean Reversion  

Mean reversion is a financial theory that suggests asset prices will eventually return to their long-term mean or average. This concept is grounded in the belief that asset prices and historical returns will gravitate towards a long-term average over time. The greater the deviation from this mean, the higher the probability that the asset's price will move closer to it in the future.



This theory has led to many investing strategies that involve the purchase or sale of stocks or other securities whose recent performances have differed greatly from their historical averages. However, a change in returns also could be a sign that a company no longer has the same prospects it once did, in which case it is less likely that mean reversion would occur.



Percentage returns and prices are not the only measures considered in mean reverting; interest rates or even the P/E ratio of a company can be subject to this phenomenon.






  Use by Traders  

Investors employ mean reversion strategies to capitalize on asset prices that have deviated significantly from their historical mean. The underlying assumption is that prices will eventually revert to their long-term average. Investors typically use mean reversion in the following ways:



Statistical Analysis: Investors use statistical tools like Z-scores to measures how far an asset price has deviated from its mean. A Z-score above 1.5 or below -1.5 might signal a trading opportunity.
Pairs Trading: Here, investors and traders identify two (2) correlated assets. When the price ratio between them deviates from its mean, they go long on the undervalued asset and short the overvalued one.
Volatility: Some traders and investors use mean reversion in the context of volatility, buying options when volatility is high with the expectation that it will revert to the mean.
Risk Management: Stop-loss orders and take-profit points can be typically set around the mean to manageme potential losses and secure gains.
Algorithmic Trading: Quantitative analysts use mean reversion in algorithmic trading strategies, often employing complex mathematical models to predict price movements.



Some considerations involved in mean reversion involve time horizon and market conditions. The effectiveness of a mean reversion strategy can vary based on the time horizon. Short-term traders may use intraday data, while long-term investors may use yearly data.



Another consideration is that mean reversion is more effective in range-bound markets and less so in trending markets.


   Calculating Mean Reversion  

Calculating mean reversion involves a series of statistical and quantitative steps to measure how far an asset's price has deviated from its historical mean.
Firstly historical price data is gathered for the respective asset. The time frame can vary based on the investor or trader's time horizon. Then the average price is computed over the selected timeframe.

   Mean Reversion and Technical Analysis  

Mean Reversion is a highly prominent concept in technical analysis, serving as the underlying principle for various indicators and trading strategies. It helps traders identify overbought or oversold conditions, thereby providing potential entry and exit points. Some technical indicator tools where the concept of mean reversion is involved:



Moving Averages: Traders and investors often use moving averages to identify the mean price over a specific period. When the price is above the moving average and over a certain threshold, it may be considered overbought. Conversely, when the price is below the moving average and under a certain threshold, it may be considered oversold.
Bollinger Bands: The bollinger bands technical analysis indicator consists of a middle band (simple moving average) and two outer bands calculated using the standard deviation. Prices are expected to revert to the middle band.
Relative Strength Index (RSI): The RSI ranges from 0 to 100 and is used to identify overbought and oversold conditions. An RSI above 70 suggests overbought conditions, while below 30 suggests oversold conditions, both implying a potential mean reversion.
Stochastic Oscillator: This indicator compares a security's closing price to its price range over a specific period, usually 14 days. Values in the stochastic oscillator that is above 80 are considered overbought, and values below 20 are considered oversold.
Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD): The MACD is used to identify changes in the strength, direction, momentum, and duration of a trend. When the MACD crosses above or below its signal, it can be a sign that the asset deviating from its mean.


  Day Trading and Mean Reversion  

Day trading involves buying and selling financial instruments within the same trading day, often holding positions for just a few minutes or hours. Mean reversion plays a critical role in day trading strategies, as it helps traders capitalize on short-term price fluctuations.



Some key strategies include intraday moving averages. Day traders often use short-term moving averages to identify the intraday mean price. When the asset's price deviates significantly, a reversion is expected.



Also day traders use RSI and stochastic oscillators for identifying overbought or oversold conditions on an intraday basis. Signals from these technical analysis tools often prompt day traders to enter or exit positions. Additionally, with bollinger bands, day traders look for "squeezes" where the bands tighten, indicating low volatility and the potential for a significant price move. The reversion is expected to the mean or middle band.



Indeed, some day traders use algorithmic strategies to execute high-frequency trades based on mean reversion algorithms.


  Swing Trading and Mean Reversion  

Swing trading is a style of trading where positions are held for several days to weeks, aiming to profit from short to medium term prices. Mean reversion is a key concept in swing trading, helping traders identify potential reversals in price trends.



When it comes to moving averages, swing traders often use longer term moving averages compared to day traders to identify the mean price over a specific period. A crossover or crossunder of the price and the moving average followed by a significant deviation from the price and the moving average can signal a potential reversal.



Also, tools like the RSI and the MACD are used to identify overbought or oversold conditions, signaling a possible mean reversion. Moreover, fibonacci retracements are used to identify potential levels where the price may revert to the mean. The most common retracement levels are 38.2%, 50% and 61.8%.



Finally swing traders can also use candlestick patterns like the doji, hammer, bullish engulfing and bearish engulfing patterns to identify potential reversals, including mean reversion opportunities.


  Forex Trading Using Mean Reversion  

As it pertains to forex trading, mean reversion strategies aim to capitalize on currency pairs reverting to their historical mean or average price. Mean reversion can be particularly useful for identifying short term opportunities using technical analysis indicators.



Forex traders often use moving averages to identify the mean exchange rate over a specific period. When a currency pair deviates significantly from this average, a reversion is often expected.



Indicators like the RSI and stochastic oscillator are commonly used to identify overbought or oversold conditions in currency pairs, signaling potential mean reversion.



Another tool forex traders and investors use are pivot points. These are used to identify potential support and resistance levels where the price may revert to the mean. They are calculated based on the high, low, and closing prices of the previous trading session.



Finally another tool that is used are currency correlations. Some traders and investors use mean reversion in the context of currency correlations. When two historically correlated currency pairs diverge, traders may go long on the underperforming pair and short the outperforming one.

   A Hypothetical Example of Mean Reversion  

Readers should consider a mean reversion situation involving the stock of Company XYZ.



Over the past 200 days, the stock of Company XYZ has had an average closing price of 50. Due to a positive earnings report, the stock price jumps to $70.



The standard deviation of the stock's price over the past 200 days is $5.



The Z-score will then be calculated where (70-50)/5 = 4.



A Z-score of 4 indicates that the stock is significantly overvalued compared to its historical mean. This could be a signal to short the stock, as it is expected to revert to its mean.



Over the next few weeks, the initial excitement fades, and the stock price gradually fall back to around $52, closer to its historical mean.


   The Benefits and Limitations of Mean Reversion  

Mean reversion offers a structured and versatile approach to trading but comes with its own set of challenges, including sensitivity to market conditions and higher transaction costs. Therefore it is crucial for traders and investors to be aware of these factors and employ robust risk management techniques.


  Benefits of Mean Reversion  

Mean Reversion offers several benefits. These include:



A Systematic Approach: Mean reversion provides a structured methodology for trading, making it easier to identify entry and exit points.Versatility: Applicable across various asset classes and timeframes, from intraday to long term timeframes.Risk Management: Fixed stop-loss and take-profit levels can be set around the mean, aiding in risk control.Profit Potential: The strategy can be profitable in range-bound markets, where other strategies like trend following may not be as effective.Confirmation: Multiple indicators such as the ones described above, can be used to confirm mean-reverting signals, increasing the strategy's reliability.


  Limitations of Mean Reversion  

Any approach comes with challenges and limitations. Some limitations of mean reversion include:



Market Conditions: Mean reversion is less effective in strongly trending markets, where prices may not revert to the mean for extended periods.
Transaction Costs: The strategy often involves frequent trading, which has a propensity of higher transaction costs.
False Signals: Shorter timeframes in particular are susceptible to market noise, which can generate false mean-reverting signals.
Economic Events: Economic shocks or sudden news can disrupt mean-reverting patterns, leading to potential losses.
Lack of Direction: Unlike trend-following strategies, mean reversion is non-directional, which may not suit all trading styles.






The theory of mean reversion is focused on the reversion of only relatively extreme changes, as normal growth or other fluctuations are an expected part of the paradigm.




What Is a Mean Reversion Strategy?
A mean reversion strategy is a trading approach that capitalizes on the tendency of financial assets to revert to their historical mean or average price over time. The strategy aims to identify assets that are significantly overvalued or undervalued and take positions based on the expectations that they will revert to their mean.




What Is the Indicator for Mean Reversion?
The most commonly used indicators for mean reversion include the z-score, moving averages, the RSI, bollinger bands and the stochastic oscillator.




What Is the Best Timeframe for Mean Reversion?
Timeframes for mean reversion are dependent on the trader or investor's objectives, risk tolerance and the asset being traded.




What Is the Best Asset to Trade Using Mean Reversion?
The selection of an asset to trade using mean reversion is dependent on various factors such as market conditions, the entity's trading and investing expertise and risk tolerance.Some commonly traded assets that are suited for mean reversion strategies include stocks, forex, commodities, exchange traded funds (ETFs), and fixed income.




What Is the Difference Between Trend Following and Mean Reversion?
Trend following and mean reversion operate on different premises. The objective of trend following is to capitalize on assets that are moving strongly in a particular direction. The objective of mean reversion is to capitalize on price deviations from an established mean or average.


   The Bottom Line  

Mean reversion is a financial theory positing that asset prices will tend to revert to their historical mean or average over time. It serves as the backbone for various trading strategies across multiple asset classes, including stocks, forex, and commodities. Investors commonly use indicators like moving averages, RSI, and bollinger bands to identify mean-reverting opportunities. These indicators help pinpoint overvalued or undervalued assets, providing potential entry and exit points.



The strategy can be applied across different timeframes, from intraday to long-term, and is particularly effective in range-bound or sideways markets. However, it's crucial for traders and investors to incorporate robust risk management techniques and be mindful of transaction costs, given the frequent trading nature of mean reversion strategies.
What Is a Mean-Variance Analysis?  

Mean-variance analysis is the process of weighing risk, expressed as variance, against expected return. Investors use mean-variance analysis to make investment decisions. Investors weigh how much risk they are willing to take on in exchange for different levels of reward. Mean-variance analysis allows investors to find the biggest reward at a given level of risk or the least risk at a given level of return.





Key Takeaways:


Mean-variance analysis is a tool used by investors to weigh investment decisions.
The analysis helps investors determine the biggest reward at a given level of risk or the least risk at a given level of return.
The variance shows how spread out the returns of a specific security are on a daily or weekly basis. 
The expected return is a probability expressing the estimated return of the investment in the security. 
If two different securities have the same expected return, but one has lower variance, the one with lower variance is preferred. 
Similarly, if two different securities have approximately the same variance, the one with the higher return is preferred.



   Understanding Mean-Variance Analysis  

Mean-variance analysis is one part of modern portfolio theory, which assumes that investors will make rational decisions about investments if they have complete information. One assumption is that investors seek low risk and high reward. There are two main components tof mean-variance analysis: variance and expected return. Variance is a number that represents how varied or spread out the numbers are in a set. For example, variance may tell how spread out the returns of a specific security are on a daily or weekly basis. The expected return is a probability expressing the estimated return of the investment in the security. If two different securities have the same expected return, but one has lower variance, the one with lower variance is the better pick. Similarly, if two different securities have approximately the same variance, the one with the higher return is the better pick.



In modern portfolio theory, an investor would choose different securities to invest in with different levels of variance and expected return. The goal of this strategy is to differentiate investments, which reduces the risk of catastrophic loss in the event of rapidly changing market conditions.


   Example of Mean-Variance Analysis  

It is possible to calculate which investments have the greatest variance and expected return. Assume the following investments are in an investor's portfolio:



Investment A: Amount = $100,000 and expected return of 5%



Investment B: Amount = $300,000 and expected return of 10%



In a total portfolio value of $400,000, the weight of each asset is:



Investment A weight = $100,000 / $400,000 = 25%



Investment B weight = $300,000 / $400,000 = 75%



Therefore, the total expected return of the portfolio is the weight of the asset in the portfolio multiplied by the expected return:



Portfolio expected return = (25% x 5%) + (75% x 10%) = 8.75%. Portfolio variance is more complicated to calculate because it is not a simple weighted average of the investments' variances. The correlation between the two investments is 0.65. The standard deviation, or square root of variance, for Investment A is 7%, and the standard deviation for Investment B is 14%. 



In this example, the portfolio variance is:



Portfolio variance = (25% ^ 2 x 7% ^ 2) + (75% ^ 2 x 14% ^ 2) + (2 x 25% x 75% x 7% x 14% x 0.65) = 0.0137



The portfolio standard deviation is the square root of the answer: 11.71%.
What Is a Medallion Signature Guarantee?  

A medallion signature guarantee is one of several special certification stamps that guarantees a signature that authorizes a transfer of securities is authentic. Parties will generally require a medallion signature guarantee when an owner wants to sell or transfer securities—such as stocks or bonds—held in physical certificate form. If an owner holds securities through a broker, they will not need to obtain a signature guarantee to sell or transfer the securities.





Key Takeaways

Medallion signature guarantees that an authorized signature to transfer securities is authentic. To provide a Medallion signature guarantee, an institution must be a member of one of three Medallion signature guarantee programs. Typically, you can obtain a Medallion signature guarantee at a financial institution where you are already a customer.Medallion signature guarantees are generally required when securities are held in physical certificate form. Yet, today individual investors rarely have physical possession of their share certificates, preferring electronic records instead.


   How Medallion Signature Guarantees Work  

To provide a Medallion signature guarantee, an institution must be a member of one of three Medallion signature guarantee programs: the Securities Transfer Agents Medallion Program (STAMP), the Stock Exchanges Medallion Program (SEMP), and the New York Stock Exchange Medallion Signature Program (MSP). 



Normally, you can obtain a Medallion signature guarantee at a financial institution where you are a customer. The bank may assess a small charge for this service; fees can range from $0 for customers with solid, established relationships to upward of six figures.



For financial institutions with on-site stamps, the stamp guarantee can be provided on the same day provided there are no outstanding requirements or errors. Otherwise, it could take between two and five business days for a review.



Because the guaranteeing institution's assets back the certification, a guarantee stamp is not easy to obtain. Banks, credit unions, and other financial institutions that offer Medallion Signature Guarantee are:



ChaseCitiCapital OneMerrill LynchNavy Federal Credit UnionNortheast Credit Union


  Common Reasons for Needing a Medallion Signature Guarantee  

Medallion signature guarantees can be used for many purposes, but the most common reasons are when



Securities are giftedSecurities are moved from one account to anotherThe owner of the security passes away


   Medallion Signature Guarantee and Share Certificate  

A medallion signature guarantee often corresponds with a share certificate. A share certificate (or stock certificate) is a written document that serves as legal proof of ownership of a set number of a company’s shares. 



This is in contrast with owning a bond, a form of debt instrument, in which a separate party loans money to a company or the government. Key information on a share certificate generally includes the following:



Certificate number
Company name and registration number
Shareholder name and address
Number of shares owned
Class of shares
Issue date of shares
Amount paid (or treated as paid) on the shares



Shares may be issued in separate classes. For example, Berkshire Hathaway offers stockholders Class A (BRK.A) and Class B (BRK.B) shares. A number of other well-known companies have dual-class structures, such as Ford (F), Meta (META), formerly Facebook, and Groupon (GRPN). Meanwhile, some companies have multiple share classes; for example, Google's parent company, Alphabet (GOOG), has three classes of shares. 



Each class offers different rights to the stockholder with regard to dividends and voting options. Sometimes, the owner of a stock certificate can give a proxy to another person to vote on matters of company policy.



If a share certificate is damaged, lost, or stolen, the company may issue a replacement certificate. In such a case, the shareholder must return the damaged document. Share certificates may either be registered or in bearer form. A bearer share certificate entitles the holder to exercise all legal rights associated with the stock.



Today individual investors rarely have physical possession of their share certificates, preferring electronic records instead.




Which Banks Offer Medallion Signature Guarantee?
Many U.S. banks offer Medallion signature guarantee, but not every branch of a participating bank can provide the service. Most large financial institutions, such as Bank of America, Chase, Wells Fargo, and Capital One provide the Medallion signature guarantee. If one of their branches does not have an on-site reviewer, the documents must be sent for review.




How Long Is a Medallion Stamp Good for?
The Medallion stamp is valid for the date it is signed.




How Much Does It Cost to Get a Medallion Signature?
Medallion signature guarantees are obtained from institutions that have the authority to issue them. For some institutions, particularly large banks, If the customer has an established relationship, they may not be subject to fees or charges. However, if fees apply, they can range from as little as $50 to $100,000 or more.




Why Is a Medallion Signature Guarantee So Hard to Get?
Medallion signature guarantees expose financial institutions to risks and liabilities; therefore, they do not issue them readily or to just anyone. Typically, they are provided for well-established customers for a nominal fee.


   The Bottom Line  

The Medallion signature guarantee validates the identity and signature of a party transferring securities or investments. Banks, credit unions, and other financial institutions must belong to one of three select Medallion signature guarantee programs to provide this service. Because of increased financial risks, financial institutions tend to react conservatively when issuing them. Most often, Medallion signature guarantee stamps are needed for the gifting of securities, to transfer assets upon the death of the original owner, and when the security or investment holder moves the assets from an account.
What Is a Media Kit?  

A media kit is a package of information assembled by a company to provide basic information about itself to reporters. The media kit is a promotional public relations tool that can serve several functions. These functions include promoting the launch of a new company or announcing the launch of a new product or service by an existing company. You can present your company as you would like it be seen and save time by eliminating the need for you or your employees to repeatedly answer the same questions.





Key Takeaways

A media kit is a public information kit a company presents to reporters and other media outlets.These kits usually include biographies, contact information, products and services, and more.You can include your website address, it's demographics and traffic information, social media profile and your goals.Most kits include a company's mission and vision statements to help those seeking information determine what it is trying to accomplish.


   Building a Media Kit  

A media kit should address your specific business's publicity and communication needs. A media kit should demonstrate your creativity and value while being informative and easily understood. It should convey everything outsiders needs to know about your business, packaged up and ready to introduce you to anyone. Finally, you should put enough effort into your kit to be proud of it.



A media kit can be as simple as a page on a company's website or as complex as a package of information and product samples sent to selected media members. The media kit commonly provides the company's official name and:



The names, titles, and biographies of executives and leadership
Information about the company's history and function
Photos and any relevant and positive press releases
Contact information for reporters


   Possible Components of a Media Kit  
  Social Media Following  

Include information on your social media platforms, including Instagram, X (formerly Twitter), Facebook, Pinterest, YouTube, Tumblr, Snapchat, or any other social media platform on which you might have a presence. This will give people a quick idea of your social media reach. 






Social media influencers can also benefit from media kits by including information on their user base and followers for potential partnerships.


  Website Traffic  

Sharing your website stats showcases your audience size and characteristics. It’s important to include figures such as your bounce rate, page views, and duration of visitors in the kit. Google Analytics is the industry standard for sharing website traffic data.


  Audience Demographics  

Google Analytics can also track your audience demographics. You can also learn more through other tools, such as Iconosquare for Instagram. Understanding your audience demographics is not only beneficial to you, but it is also beneficial to people that might want to engage you somehow. If your audience aligns with their goals, a collaboration might be a good fit for you both.






It's okay to include your rates in your media kit. Doing this can help prospects save time deciding whether they can afford your products or services and save you time by screening them out before even talking to them.


  Your Goals  

It's smart to identify your goals in a media kit, so a recipient can also self-identify their potential role in them. By noting the capabilities you'll use to achieve your goals, it could spark ideas and interest on the part of your press kit recipient.


  Contact Information  

There is little point in sending a media kit with no contact information. You should ensure your contact information is up-to-date and as timeless as possible. This means a phone number, website, social media account, or email address that will not change anytime soon.


  About You  

Include a short paragraph about you and your organization. This is a great place to discuss what you do and why you do what you do. Reiterate your strengths and unique characteristics. Provide insight into who you are and why you would be a good collaborator.


   Example of a Media Kit  

One example of a media kit is the one for finance website Kiplinger.com. Its media kit presents a clear value proposition on why Kiplinger’s advice is trusted and highly practical “for readers seeking actionable solutions.” Below this headline are product links, including the Kiplinger Personal Finance Magazine, Kiplinger Retirement Report, and Kiplinger’s Custom Content option.



In addition, Kiplinger offers native advertising, a retirement planning guide, and email opportunities. The site also includes a quick link to contact an Ad Sales Representative. This example is on the simpler end of media kits; however, the materials still display Kiplinger’s important information in a readily accessible form to promote the company's product and clearly communicate its mission and audience.




What Is a Media Kit and Why Is It Important?
A media kit is a bundle of materials and information you put together to hand out to members of the press or other media outlets. Having one is important because it gives reporters numbers to contact, establishes your brand, and promotes your amicability towards sharing information.




How Do You Make a Media Kit?
How you make a media kit depends on what you do. Generally, it includes contact information, company history, mission and vision statements, biographies, client stories, and anything else you think might interest the press. It can also be as minimal as a webpage with basic information.




Who Needs Media Kits?
Media kits should be an essential part of the toolbox for every business endeavor. You never know when you might need to make your company information easily accessible. It is also a great marketing tool that is usually less expensive than most marketing campaigns.


   The Bottom Line  

Media kits function as more than informational packets for the press. You can use them for marketing purposes and brand growth. If you have new products, you can send samples to review websites and social media influencers or even include a video review of the product in your kit. Lastly, every business should have some form of online media kit because it's another way to reach a target audience and extend their reach.

What Is the Median?  

The term median refers to a metric used in statistics. It is the middle number in a sorted ascending or descending list of numbers and can be more descriptive of that data set than the average. It is the point above and below which half (50%) of the observed data falls, and so represents the midpoint of the data. The median is often compared with other descriptive statistics such as the mean (average), mode, and standard deviation.





Key Takeaways

The median is the middle number in a sorted list of numbers and can be more descriptive of that data set than the average.The median is sometimes used as opposed to the mean when there are outliers in the sequence that might skew the average of the values.If there is an odd amount of numbers, the median value is the number that is in the middle, with the same amount of numbers below and above.If there is an even amount of numbers in the list, the middle pair must be determined, added together, and divided by two to find the median value.


   Understanding the Median  

Statistics is a branch of mathematics. It involves the collection and study of data, which allows researchers to make inferences or determinations about a certain topic. The analysis of quantitative data can be used to study anything from demographics, populations, and investments among other things.



A median is the middle number in a sorted list of numbers (either ascending or descending) used in statistical studies. To determine the median value in a sequence of numbers, the numbers must first be sorted or arranged in value order from lowest to highest or highest to lowest.



If there is an odd amount of numbers, the median value is the number that is in the middle, with the same amount of numbers below and above.If there is an even amount of numbers in the list, the middle pair must be determined, added together, and divided by two to find the median value.



The median can be used to determine an approximate average, or mean, but is not to be confused with the actual mean.






The median is sometimes used as opposed to the mean when there are outliers in the sequence that might skew the average of the values. The median of a sequence can be less affected by outliers than the mean.


   Median vs. Mean  

As noted above, it's important not to confuse the terms median and mean. The two may sound the same (which is a common misconception) but they are very different. A median is a number that falls in the middle of a group. Remember, this is done by ordering the numbers from smallest to largest and locating the one that falls in the middle.



A mean, on the other hand, is the average of a data set. Also called the arithmetic mean, it is the average of the sum of the numbers in a group. In order to figure out the mean, you must take the sum of the numbers in the group and divide the sum by the total number of data points. For instance, let's say a data set consists of the numbers 3, 5, 7, and 19. To figure out the mean:



Add the numbers together: 3 + 5 + 7 + 19 = 34Divide the sum by the number of data points: 34 ÷ 4 = 8.5



In this case, the mean is 8.5. The median, on the other hand, would be 6 or (5 + 7) ÷ 2. That's because there's an even number of data points, which we add together and divide by 2 to get the result.






The median is closely associated with quartiles, or dividing up observed data into four equal parts. The median would be the center point, with the first two quartiles falling below it and the second two above it. Other ways of bucketing data include quintiles (in five sections) and deciles (in 10 sections).


   Example of a Median  

To find the median value in a list with an odd amount of numbers, one would find the number that is in the middle with an equal amount of numbers on either side of the median. To find the median, first arrange the numbers in order, usually from lowest to highest.



For example, in a data set of {3, 13, 2, 34, 11, 26, 47}, the sorted order becomes {2, 3, 11, 13, 26, 34, 47}. The median is the number in the middle {2, 3, 11, 13, 26, 34, 47}, which in this instance is 13 since there are three numbers on either side.



To find the median value in a list with an even amount of numbers, one must determine the middle pair, add them, and divide by two. Again, arrange the numbers in order from lowest to highest.



For example, in a data set of {3, 13, 2, 34, 11, 17, 27, 47}, the sorted order becomes {2, 3, 11, 13, 17, 27, 34, 47}. The median is the average of the two numbers in the middle {2, 3, 11, 13, 17, 26 34, 47}, which in this case is 15 or (13 + 17) ÷ 2 = 15.




How Do You Calculate the Median?
The median is the middle value in a set of data. First, organize and order the data from smallest to largest. To find the midpoint value, divide the number of observations by two. If there are an odd number of observations, round that number up, and the value in that position is the median. If the number of observations is even, take the average of the values found above and below that position.




Where Is the Median in a Normal Distribution?
In the normal distribution or bell curve the median, mean, and mode are all the same value and fall at the highest point in the center of the curve.




When Is the Mean and Median Different?
In a skewed data set, the mean and median will typically be different. The mean is calculated by adding up all of the values in the data and dividing by the number of observations. If there are sizable outliers, or if the data clumps around certain values, the mean (average) will not be the midpoint of the data.For instance, in a set of data {0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 10, 10} the average would be 24/8 = 3. The median, however, would be 1 (the midpoint value).This is why many economists favor the median for reporting a nation's income or wealth, since it is more representative of the actual income distribution.


   The Bottom Line  

The median is the number that lies in the middle of an ordered dataset that goes from lowest to highest. It should not be confused with the mean, which is determined by adding the numbers in a set together and dividing by the total number of data points. Many experts prefer using the median over the mean because it often provides a more accurate representation of the distribution in a data set.
What Is Medicaid?  

The term Medicaid refers to a public health insurance program that provides health care coverage to low-income families and individuals in the United States. The program is jointly funded by the federal government and individual states. It is operated at the state level which means that coverage and administration vary greatly from state to state. It is available only to individuals and families who meet specific income-based criteria.



Recipients are U.S. citizens, permanent residents, or legal immigrants. Approximately 70.6 million people were covered by Medicaid as of September 2020.





Key Takeaways

Medicaid is a joint federal and state program that provides health care coverage to low-income individuals.The federal government matches state spending on Medicaid while states are responsible for designing and administering the programEligibility is determined based on one's income in comparison to the federal poverty level.Access to Medicaid is proven to show increased individuals with coverage and improvements in overall health.


   Understanding Medicaid  

Medicaid was signed into law in 1965 by President Lyndon B. Johnson and authorized by Title XIX of the Social Security Act, which also created Medicare.﻿﻿ It is a government-sponsored insurance program for individuals of any age whose resources and income are insufficient to cover health care. Medicaid does not provide health care directly to individuals. Instead, it covers their doctor visits, hospital stays, long-term medical care, custodial care, and other health-related costs.



Individual states decide on who qualifies for coverage, the type of coverage, and the process of paying health care workers and hospitals. That's because each state is responsible to manage and administer its own Medicaid program. The federal government matches state spending and the matching rate varies by state from about a statutory minimum of 50% to a maximum of 83%. States are not required to participate in Medicaid, although all states do.﻿﻿



The program is the largest source of funding for health-related services for low-income individuals in the U.S. Total Medicaid spending came to $613.5 billion in 2019, accounting for 16% of the nation's health care bill.﻿﻿ The federal government paid 64.5% of the tab while individual states paid 35.6%.﻿﻿



Medicaid coverage has typically included the following groups:



Low-income children and their parentsPregnant womenPeople with disabilitiesAdults over the age of 65﻿﻿



Eligibility was expanded to include adults under the age of 65, provided their incomes fell under 133% of the federal poverty level (FPL), as per the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.﻿﻿ Children account for 38% of enrollees with about 18% of the total cost. By comparison, people with disabilities account for 14% of enrollees with about 36% of total costs.﻿﻿


   Special Conditions  

Eligibility for Medicaid is determined by filling out an application through the Health Insurance Marketplace website or directly through your state’s Medicaid agency.



Your eligibility is determined by income in relation to the FPL. The FPL is used to determine whether a family or individual's income allows them to qualify for federal benefits. In general, if an individual's income is less than 100% to 200% of the FPL, and they are either disabled, a child, pregnant, or elderly, there will be a program available for them. If their income is less than 138% of the FPL, then there may be a program available for them.﻿﻿



The income taken into consideration in determining eligibility is an individual's modified adjusted gross income (MAGI). This is taxable income plus certain deductions, such as Social Security benefits and tax-exempt interest.






Make sure you check the Medicaid website for any changes to eligibility and other up-to-date information about the program.


  Trump's Changes to Eligibility  

The Trump administration allowed U.S. states to remove Medicaid coverage for individuals who do not meet certain work requirements or who are not engaged in work activities for a specific number of hours each month.﻿﻿ Arkansas was the first state to implement this policy and it resulted in 18,000 people losing health care coverage. However, this policy was repeatedly blocked in federal courts and Arkansas has suspended the requirements.﻿﻿ ﻿﻿


   Medicaid vs. the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA)  

President Barack Obama signed the Affordable Care Act (ACA) into law in 2010. The law, referred to as Obamacare, states that all legal residents and citizens of the United States with incomes of up to 138% of the poverty line qualify for coverage in Medicaid participating states. While the law worked to expand both federal funding and eligibility for Medicaid, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that states are not required to participate in the expansion in order to continue receiving already established levels of Medicaid funding.



As of March 2021, the following 12 states did not expand coverage: Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kansas, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Wisconsin, and Wyoming.







   Advantages of Medicaid  

Medicaid has helped to reduce the number of people without health insurance and the ACA has helped even further. In 2013, the year before major provisions of the ACA went into effect, an estimated 44 million people didn't have health insurance. By 2017, that number dropped down to 27.4 million.



Many Americans would be without health insurance if Medicaid didn't exist. This is so because low-income individuals often don't have access to insurance through their jobs, and purchasing private health insurance in the marketplace is simply not affordable. Medicaid has provided access to health care that has statistically shown improvements in the overall well-being of individuals who otherwise would not be covered for even simple doctor visits or medication.
What Is the Medical Cost Ratio (MCR)?  

Medical cost ratio (MCR), also referred to as medical loss ratio, is a metric used in the private health insurance industry. The ratio is calculated by dividing total medical expenses paid by an insurer by the total insurance premiums it collected. A lower ratio likely indicates higher profitability for the insurer, as it signifies a larger amount of premiums are left over after paying customer insurance claims.



Under the Affordable Care Act (ACA), insurers are required to allocate 80% or more of their insurance premiums toward customer medical expenses or other services that improve healthcare.﻿﻿ Insurers who fail to abide by this standard must return the excess funds back to consumers. These rebates amounted to nearly $2.46 billion in 2019, based on figures filed through October 16, 2020.﻿﻿





Key Takeaways

The medical cost ratio (MCR) is a metric used to assess the profitability of medical insurance companies.It consists of the claims they pay divided by the premiums they collect.The ACA requires insurers to spend at least 80% of premiums on healthcare, with any excess required to be rebated to consumers.﻿﻿


   How the Medical Cost Ratio (MCR) Works  

Medical insurers collect premiums from customers in exchange for assuming liability for funding future medical insurance claims. The insurer reinvests the premiums they collect, generating a return on investment. In order to be profitable, the insurer must collect premiums and generate investment returns greater than both the claims made against its policies and its fixed costs.



One key metric that insurance companies monitor is medical cost ratio (MCR). This metric consists of total medical expense claims that were paid divided by total premiums collected. Expressed as a percentage, a higher figure indicates lower profitability, as a large portion of collected premiums are redirected to fund customer claims. Conversely, a lower number indicates higher profitability, as it shows substantial premiums are left over after covering all claims. 






The MCR is used by all major healthcare companies to ensure that they are adhering to regulations and meeting their fiscal requirements.



Insurance companies selling large plans (usually more than 50 insured employees) must spend at least 85% of premiums on healthcare. This means their MCR can be no lower than 85%. Insurers that focus on small employers and individual plans must spend at least 80% of premiums on healthcare, meaning their MCR is no lower than 80%. The other 20% can go toward administrative, overhead, and marketing costs. This split between healthcare and non-healthcare related spending is known as the 80/20 rule.﻿﻿



If an insurer generates an MCR below the 80% or 85% threshold, the excess premiums must be rebated to customers. This regulation was introduced in 2010 by the Affordable Care Act.﻿﻿


   Real World Example of the Medical Cost Ratio (MCR)  

Consider the case of XYZ Insurance, a hypothetical medical insurance company. In its most recent fiscal year, XYZ collected $100 million in premiums and paid out $78 million in claims to customers, resulting in an MCR of 78%. With those numbers, XYZ would be considered a profitable operation compared to most other medical insurers. 



Under ACA rules, however, the 2 percentage points of extra premiums XYZ collected beyond the 80% threshold must be rebated to customers or directed toward other healthcare services.﻿﻿ These rebates amounted to nearly $2.46 billion in 2019, based on figures filed through October 16, 2020, compared with $706.7 million two years earlier.﻿﻿ ﻿﻿
What Is a Medium of Exchange?  

A medium of exchange is an intermediary instrument or system used to facilitate the purchase and sale of goods and services between parties.



For a system to function as a medium of exchange, it must represent a standard of value. Further, all parties to the transaction must accept that standard.



In modern economies, the medium of exchange is currency. Gold has served as a medium of exchange throughout history.





Key Takeaways

A medium of exchange is a portable instrument that is used as an intermediary to facilitate the sale and purchase of goods between parties.In modern economies, the medium of exchange is currency.A currency must remain reasonably stable in value in order for it to work as an intermediary. If its value becomes unstable, it is no longer viable as a means of exchange. 


   How a Medium of Exchange Works  

A traditional barter system only works when both parties to a transaction have something that the other party wants. Even then, it works only when both parties agree on the value of the goods that each is offering. Is one chicken worth two bars of soap or three? The haggling must have been endless.



Thus, introducing a medium of exchange allows for greater efficiency in an economy and stimulates an increase in overall trading activity. One or both parties can sell their product for a number of gold coins, which can then be used to buy the products they want.






Using a medium of exchange allows for greater efficiency in an economy and stimulates an increase in overall trading activity.


   Money As a Medium of Exchange  

Money enables anyone who possesses it to participate as an equal market player. When consumers use money to purchase an item or service, they are effectively making a bid in response to an asking price.



This interaction creates order and predictability in the marketplace. Producers know what to produce and how much to charge, while consumers can reliably plan their budgets around predictable and stable pricing models.



If money—as represented by a currency—is no longer viable as a medium of exchange, or if its monetary units can no longer be accurately valued, businesses and consumers lose their ability to plan. Market volatility will cause the markets to become chaotic.



Prices are bid up, or raised, in response to worries about scarcity and fears of the unknown. Meanwhile, supply diminishes because of hoarding behavior, coupled with an inability of producers to quickly replenish inventory.


   Characteristics of a Medium of Exchange  

An effective medium of exchange has certain characteristics. Most of all, its value is widely recognized and reasonably stable. Even so, the proliferation of currencies around the world makes it necessary for travelers to exchange their native currency with a local currency in order to do business.



For sheer practicality, a medium of exchange must be dividable into a number of smaller units that can be added or subtracted to equal the payment charged for a specific product or service.



The governments that issue currency are responsible for most of their qualities. They must make certain that the currency is made widely available to the public, that it is not easy to copy or reproduce, and that it is available in sufficient quantities as needed.



Some of these characteristics may not apply to cryptocurrency, which has no physical existence. The extreme volatility of cryptocurrency prices may prevent them for now from being widely adopted as a means of payment.


   Purposes of a Medium of Exchange  

As noted, the primary purpose of a medium of exchange is to smooth transactions between parties. An effective medium of exchange has a reasonably stable value that is known and accepted by all parties.



That relative stability gives currency, as the primary medium of exchange, another important purpose: It can be stored for a long period of time. The concepts of saving and investing evolved from the potential of currencies to serve over the long term as stores of value.


   Alternative Currencies As a Medium of Exchange  

Alternative currencies have appeared throughout time during periods of economic duress to spur commerce or buttress a national currency.



In 1907, a cascading series of bank failures caused widespread cash shortages. Companies had to issue company scrip and other forms of emergency currency in order to pay their workers.



Workers could redeem the scrip for food and services, or they could hold onto it for future redemption once U.S. dollars became available. Such informal money substitutes are little more than an IOU and depend on the reputation of the issuer for their acceptability as a form of payment.


   Example of an Alternative Medium of Exchange  

Across the U.S., local currencies have sprung up with the primary purpose of fostering economic growth and sustainability in a region. The best-known case of a thriving local currency is BerkShares, launched in 2006 and still accepted by some 350 businesses in the Berkshires region of Massachusetts.



The value of BerkShares is pegged to the value of the dollar but the bills are issued at a discount. BerkShares can be obtained at participating bank branches (nine branch offices of three local banks) in exchange for U.S. dollars at a rate of 95 cents.




What Is a Good Medium of Exchange?
A medium of exchange works if its value is immediately recognizable, reasonably stable, and portable. It then serves its purpose as an intermediary for the exchange of goods or services between two parties.




What Is a Bad Medium of Exchange?
A currency is only as good as the government that issues it. Out-of-control inflation, political instability, and government mismanagement are reflected in the value and stability of a nation's currency.For example, the worst currency in the world at this time, according to World Atlas, is the Venezuelan bolivar. Once a strong currency, hyperinflation has made the bolivar almost worthless as a medium of exchange for its citizens.




What Was the First Medium of Exchange?
The earliest medium of exchange may have been a coin issued about 2,600 years ago in Lydia, an ancient kingdom in what is now western Turkey. The coin was made of a gold and silver alloy, it was stamped with an official government image, and the metal had a guaranteed weight and purity.Gold and other metals may have been used earlier as a medium of exchange, but the Lydians were the first known to have issued it in a standardized form that could be accepted as having a set value.


   The Bottom Line  

In an Encyclopedia Britannica article written in part by Milton Friedman, money is defined as "a commodity accepted by general consent as a medium of economic exchange." In modern economies, the local currency is the universal medium of exchange, except in dire economic circumstances. For example, as Britannica points out, the usual medium of exchange in Germany directly after World War II was cigarettes or cognac.
What Is a Medium Term Note (MTN)?  

A medium-term note (MTN) is a note that usually matures in five to 10 years. A corporate MTN can be continuously offered by a company to investors through a dealer with investors being able to choose from differing maturities, ranging from nine months to 30 years, though most MTNs range in maturity from one to 10 years.


   Understanding Medium Term Notes (MTN)  

By knowing that a note is medium term, investors have an idea of what its maturity will be when they compare its price to that of other fixed-income securities. All else being equal, the coupon rate on an MTN will be higher than those achieved on short-term notes. For corporate MTNs, this type of debt program is used by a company so it can have constant cash flows coming in from its debt issuance; it allows a company to tailor its debt issuance to meet its financing needs. Medium-term notes allow a company to register with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) only once, instead of every time for differing maturities.


   Benefits of Medium-Term Notes  

MTNs offer investors an option between traditionally short-term and long-term investments. This can be ideal for situations where the investor’s goals fall into a time frame beyond those offered by certain municipal bonds or short-term banknotes without having to commit to the long-term note options. Businesses can benefit from MTNs based on their ability to provide a consistent cash flow from investors. Additionally, businesses can choose to offer MTNs with or without call options.



While the rates associated with call options are often higher, the business maintains the right to retire or call the bond within a specified period of time before the bond reaches maturity. This allows businesses to take advantage of lower rates, should they occur before a bond series has reached maturity, by calling in the bond issue and then issuing new bonds at the lower rate. Non-callable options do not have the same level of risk regarding the duration of the investment, which leads them to be offered at lower rates.


   Options Available in Medium Term Notes  

Investors looking to participate in the MTN market often have options regarding the exact nature of the investment. This can include a variety of maturity dates as well as dollar amount requirements. Since the term involved in an MTN is longer than those associated with short-term investment options, the coupon rate will often be higher on an MTN while being lower than the rates offered on some longer-term securities.
What Is a Melt-Up?  

A melt-up is a sustained and often unexpected improvement in the investment performance of an asset or asset class, driven partly by a stampede of investors who don't want to miss out on its rise, rather than by fundamental improvements in the economy.



Gains that a melt-up creates are considered to be unreliable indications of the direction the market is ultimately headed. Melt ups often precede meltdowns.





Key Takeaways

A melt-up is a sudden, persistent rise in the price of a security or market, often due to investor herding.Melt ups are not necessarily indicative of a fundamental shift and may reflect market psychology instead.Poor decisions to buy in to a melt-up can be avoided by focusing on economic indicators that provide an overall picture of the health of the US economy or on the fundamentals of a stock.


   Understanding Melt Ups and Nuances of Economic Indicators  

Ignoring melt ups and meltdowns and instead focusing on fundamental factors begins with an understanding of economic indicators. Economic indicators come in the forms of leading indicators and lagging indicators. These are all forms of economic indicators, which investors follow to forecast the direction of the stock market and overall health of the U.S. economy.



Leading indicators are factors that will shift before the economy starts to follow a particular pattern. For example, the Consumer Confidence Index (CCI) is a leading indicator that reflects consumer perceptions and attitudes. Are they spending freely? Do they feel like they have less cash to work with? A rise or fall of this index is a strong indication of the future level of consumer spending, which accounts for 70% of the economy.



Additional leading indicators include the Durable Goods Report (DGR), developed from a monthly survey of heavy manufacturers, and the Purchasing Managers Index (PMI), another survey-based indicator that economists watch to predict gross domestic product (GDP) growth.



Lagging indicators shift only after the economy has begun to follow a particular pattern. These are often technical indicators that trail the price movements of their underlying assets. Certain examples of lagging indicators are a moving average crossover and a series of bond defaults.


   Melt Ups and Fundamental Investing  

Many investors attempt to avoid melt ups and their impact on investor emotions when placing bets by instead focusing on the fundamentals of companies. Warren Buffett, for example, is a famous value investor, who made his fortune by careful attention to companies’ financial statements, even amid economic turmoil. He focused on corporate value and price: Was the company on solid financial footing? How experienced and reliable was the management? And was it over- or under-priced? These questions often help investors focus on intrinsic value over hype.


   Example of Melt Ups  

Financial analysts saw the run-up in the stock market in early 2010 as a possible melt-up, because unemployment rates continued to be high, both residential and commercial real estate values continued to suffer, and retail investors continued to take money out of stocks.



More examples of melt ups occurred during the Great Depression, when the stock market rose and fell several times despite a generally weak economy. According to research by wealth managers, stocks fell by more than 80% between 1929 and 1932. But they posted returns of more than 90% in July and August of 1932 and the trend continued over the next six months.
What Is a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU)?  

A memorandum of understanding is an agreement between two or more parties outlined in a formal document. It is not necessarily legally binding, which depends on the signatories' intent and the language in the agreement, but signals the willingness of the parties to move forward with a contract.



The MOU can be seen as the starting point for negotiations as it defines the scope and purpose of the talks. Such memoranda are most often seen in international treaty negotiations but also may be used in high-stakes business dealings such as merger talks.





Key Takeaways

A memorandum of understanding (MOU) is a document that describes the broad outlines of an agreement that two or more parties have reached.MOUs communicate the mutually accepted expectations of all of the parties involved in a negotiation.While not necessarily legally binding, the MOU signals that a binding contract is imminent.The MOU is most often found in international relations.


   How an MOU Works  

An MOU is an expression of agreement to proceed. It indicates that the parties have reached an understanding and are moving forward. Although it is not always legally binding, it is a serious declaration that a contract is imminent.



Under U.S. law, an MOU is similar to a letter of intent. In fact, arguably a memorandum of understanding, a memorandum of agreement, and a letter of intent are all similar documents. All communicate an agreement on a mutually beneficial goal and a desire to see it through to completion.






Although an MOU is not necessarily legally binding, it allows parties to prepare for signing a contract by explaining the broad concepts and expectations of their agreement. Communicating in clear terms what each party hopes to gain from an agreement can be essential to the smooth execution of signing a legal contract in the future.



MOUs communicate the mutually accepted expectations of the people, organizations, or governments involved. They are most often used in international relations because, unlike treaties, they can be produced relatively quickly and in secret. They also are in use in many U.S. and state government agencies, particularly when major contracts are in the planning stages.


   Contents of an MOU  

An MOU clearly outlines specific points of understanding. It names the parties, describes the project on which they are agreeing, defines its scope, and details each party's roles and responsibilities.



While not always legally enforceable, an MOU is a significant step because of the time and effort involved in negotiating and drafting an effective document. To produce an MOU, the participating parties need to reach a mutual understanding. In the process, each side learns what is most important to the others before moving forward.






An MOU communicates the mutually accepted expectations of the people, organizations, or governments involved.



The process often begins with each party effectively drafting its own best-case MOU. It considers its ideal or preferred outcome, what it believes it has to offer to the other parties, and what points may be non-negotiable on its side. This is each party's starting position for negotiations.


   Advantages and Disadvantages of an MOU  

A memorandum of understanding allows all parties to clearly state all of their objectives and goals. This makes for less uncertainty and prevents future unexpected disputes from occurring. Furthermore, by clearly laying out what each party expects of the other, an MOU provides a blueprint for any contract both parties may or may not wish to draw up in the future.



The biggest drawback of an MOU, depending on your point of view, is that it is not necessarily legally binding. While in some cases this may be a benefit, since neither party is required to do what they say in the MOU, they can simply walk away or change their expectations. Of course, this all depends on the intent and legal language of the MOU.



MOUs can take significant time and planning to create and if one party completely changes its requirements, creating the MOU would be a large waste of resources.


   Example of an MOU  

During trade talks with a representative of China in Washington in April 2019, U.S. President Donald Trump was asked by a reporter how long he expected U.S.-China memorandums of understanding to last. "I don't like MOUs because they don't mean anything," the former president replied. After some discussion, it was decided that any document that emerged from the talks would be called a trade agreement, never an MOU.




Is an MOU Legally Binding?
A memorandum of understanding (MOU) is a legal document but it is not necessarily legally binding, although it usually signals a contract is imminent. The specific intent and language of the agreement will determine whether it is actually binding or not.




What Is the Difference Between an MOU and an MOA?
An MOU is a document that describes very broad concepts of mutual understanding, goals, and plans shared by the parties. In contrast, an MOA (memorandum of agreement) is a document describing in detail the specific responsibilities of, and actions to be taken by, each of the parties so that their goals may be accomplished.




How Do You Write an MOU?
Usually, a lawyer will draft an MOU. An MOU should clearly state the following: what parties are involved, the context of the agreement, the proposed date of when the agreement will become effective, the contact details of all relevant parties, the broad purpose of the agreement, and what each party is hoping to achieve, as well as a space for all necessary signatures.




Why Is an MOU Important?
An MOU is important because it allows each party to clearly state their objectives and what they expect from one another. Drafting an MOU can help solve any disputes before each party enters into a full, legally binding contract.


   The Bottom Line  

A memorandum of understanding (MOU) is a starting point of negotiations between multiple parties to signal the intent of doing business or coming to an agreement. It simplifies a legal contract by establishing the key objectives and goals.
What Is Mental Accounting?  

Mental accounting refers to the different values a person places on the same amount of money, based on subjective criteria, often with detrimental results. Mental accounting is a concept in the field of behavioral economics. Developed by economist Richard H. Thaler, it contends that individuals classify funds differently and therefore are prone to irrational decision-making in their spending and investment behavior.





Key Takeaways

Mental accounting, a behavioral economics concept introduced by Nobel Prize-winning economist Richard Thaler, refers to the different values people place on money, based on subjective criteria.Mental accounting often leads people to make irrational investment decisions and behave in financially counterproductive or detrimental ways, such as funding a low-interest savings account while carrying large credit card balances.To avoid the mental-accounting bias, individuals should treat money as completely interchangeable no matter where they allocate it—whether to a budget account (everyday living expenses), a discretionary spending account, or a wealth account (savings and investments).


   Understanding Mental Accounting  

In his 1999 paper "Mental Accounting Matters," Richard Thaler, currently a professor of economics at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business, defined mental accounting as “the set of cognitive operations used by individuals and households to organize, evaluate, and keep track of financial activities."



Underlying the theory is the concept of the fungibility of money. To say money is fungible means that, regardless of its origins or intended use, all money is the same.



To avoid the mental-accounting bias, individuals should treat money as perfectly fungible when they allocate it among different accounts, be it a budget account (everyday living expenses), a discretionary spending account, or a wealth account (savings and investments). They also should value a dollar the same whether it is earned through work or given to them.



Thaler observed that people frequently violate the fungibility principle, especially in a windfall situation. Take a tax refund. Getting a check from the IRS is generally regarded as "found money," something extra that the recipient often feels free to spend on a discretionary item. But in fact, the money rightfully belonged to the individual in the first place, as the word "refund" implies, and is mainly a restoration of money (in this case, an overpayment of tax), not a gift. Therefore, it should not be treated as a gift, but rather viewed in much the same way that the individual would view their regular income.






To avoid the mental-accounting bias, people should value every dollar they receive in the same way—whether it is earned through work or given to them. Don't think of a tax refund as a windfall, suitable for splurging.


   Example of Mental Accounting  

The mental-accounting line of thinking seems to make sense but is in fact highly illogical. For instance, some people keep a special “money jar” or similar fund set aside for a vacation or a new home, while at the same time carrying substantial credit card debt. They are likely to treat the money in this special fund differently from the money that is being used to pay down debt, in spite of the fact that diverting funds from the debt-repayment process increases interest payments, thereby reducing their total net worth.



Broken down further, it’s illogical (and, in fact, detrimental) to maintain a savings jar that earns little or no interest while simultaneously holding credit card debt that accrues double-digit figures annually. In many cases, the interest on this debt will erode any interest you could earn in a savings account. Individuals in this scenario would be best off using the funds they have saved in the special account to pay off the expensive debt before it accumulates any further.



The solution to this problem seems straightforward yet many people do not behave in this way. The reason has to do with the type of personal value that individuals place on particular assets. Many people feel, for example, that money saved for a new house or a child’s college fund is simply “too important” to relinquish, even if doing so would be the most logical and beneficial move. So the practice of maintaining money in a low- or no-interest account while also carrying outstanding debt remains common.






Professor Thaler made a cameo appearance in the movie The Big Short to explain the "hot hand fallacy" as it applied to synthetic collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) during the housing bubble prior to the 2007-2008 financial crisis.


   Mental Accounting in Investing  

People also tend to experience mental-accounting bias when investing. For instance, many investors divide their assets between safe portfolios and speculative ones on the premise that they can prevent the negative returns from speculative investments impacting the total portfolio.



In this case, the difference in net wealth is zero, regardless of whether the investor holds multiple portfolios or one larger portfolio. The only discrepancy in these two situations is the amount of time and effort the investor takes to separate the portfolios from one another.



Mental accounting often leads investors to make irrational decisions. Borrowing from Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky's groundbreaking theory on loss aversion, Thaler offers this example:



An investor owns two stocks: one with a paper gain, the other with a paper loss. The investor needs to raise cash and must sell one of the stocks. Mental accounting is biased toward selling the winner even though selling the loser is usually the rational decision, due to tax-loss benefits as well as the fact that the losing stock is a weaker investment. The pain of realizing a loss is too much for the investor to bear, so the investor sells the winner to avoid that pain. This is the loss-aversion effect that can lead investors astray with their decisions.




Why Do We Do Mental Accounting?
People have a natural tendency to treat money differently, depending on factors such as its origin and intended use. That way of thinking gradually makes less sense the more you think about it and ends up actually being detrimental to our finances.




Is Mental Accounting a Behavioral Bias?
Yes. Behavioral biases can be described as irrational beliefs or behaviors that unconsciously influence our decision-making. And mental accounting can be described as resulting in illogical ways of viewing and managing our money.




How Can Mental Accounting be Prevented?
The key to dealing with mental accounting and not succumbing to it is to treat money as interchangeable and not give it labels. Don’t consider certain money less important because it came from an unexpected source or continue to park money in a savings account paying little to no interest when you have debts to repay with much higher borrowing costs.


   The Bottom Line  

Mental accounting is a trap that many of us, including seasoned investors, fall into. The majority of people assign subjective value to money, usually based on where it came from and how it’s intended to be used. While that approach may sound harmless and totally reasonable, it can work against us and leave us economically worse off.
What Are Menu Costs?  

Menu costs are a type of transaction cost incurred by firms when they change their prices. Menu costs are one microeconomic explanation offered by New Keynesian economists for macroeconomic price-stickiness, which may cause an economy to fail to adjust to changing macroeconomic conditions.





Key Takeaways

Menu costs are the costs that a business faces when it decides to change its prices.Menu costs are one explanation for price-stickiness, a core tenet of New Keynesian economic theory.Price-stickiness describes prices that do not adjust in response to macroeconomic changes.Prices that do not change with inflation can contribute to a recession.Companies can reduce menu costs by developing a wise pricing strategy so that fewer changes are necessary.


   Understanding Menu Costs  

Menu costs are the costs incurred by a business when it changes the prices it offers to its customers. A classic example is a restaurant that has to physically print new menus when it changes the prices of its dishes.



The main takeaway from menu costs is that some prices are sticky. That is, firms are hesitant to change their prices until there is a sufficient disparity between the firm's current price and the equilibrium market price to justify the expense of incurring the menu cost.



For example, a restaurant should not change its prices until the price change will result in sufficient additional revenue to cover the cost of printing new menus. In practice, however, it may be difficult to determine the equilibrium market price or to account for all menu costs, so it is hard for firms and consumers to behave precisely in this manner.


   History of the Menu Costs Concept  

The concept of menu costs was originally introduced by economists Eytan Sheshinski and Yoram Weiss in 1977. Sheshinski and Yoram argued that in an inflationary environment, the prices firms charge will not rise continuously but in repeated, discrete jumps that occur when the expected increase in revenue justifies incurring the fixed cost of changing the price.



New Keynesian economists later applied the argument as a general theory of nominal price rigidity. Economists used it as an explanation for price-stickiness and its role in propagating macroeconomic fluctuations. The most direct application was a 1985 paper by Gregory Mankiw, who argued that even small menu costs could produce enough price rigidity to have a major macroeconomic impact.



George Akerlof and Janet Yellen put forward the idea that firms will not want to change their prices due to bounded rationality, unless the benefit is more than a small amount. This bounded rationality leads to inertia in nominal prices and wages, which can cause output to fluctuate at constant nominal prices and wages.


   The Influence of Menu Costs on Industry  

When menu costs are high in an industry, price adjustments are usually infrequent. They generally only occur when the profit margin begins to erode to a point where avoiding menu costs results in a greater amount of lost revenue.



How expensive it is to change prices depends on the type of firm and the technology in use. For example, it may be necessary to reprint menus, update price lists, contact a distribution and sales network, or manually re-tag merchandise on the shelf. Even when there are few apparent menu costs, changing prices may make customers apprehensive about buying at the new price. This purchasing hesitancy can result in a subtle type of menu cost in terms of lost potential sales.



Menu costs may be small in some industries, but there is often sufficient friction and cost at scale to exert influence on the business decision of whether to reprice or not. In a 1997 study, store-level data from five multi-store supermarket chains was examined to directly measure menu costs. The study found that menu costs per store averaged more than 35% of net profit margins. This means that the profitability of items needed to drop more than 35% to justify updating the final price of the items.



The authors argued that menu costs may cause considerable nominal rigidity in other industries or markets—essentially, a ripple effect through suppliers and distributors—thus, amplifying their effects on the industry as a whole.






Some menu costs are unavoidable because businesses must raise their prices at some point to keep up with inflation. However, a business can minimize menu costs by devising a pricing strategy that considers their unique value and branding compared to market competitors.


  Industry Pricing Factors  

Menu costs vary widely by region and industry. This can be due to local regulations, which may require a separate price tag on each item, thus increasing menu costs. Alternatively, there may be relatively few fixed contract suppliers, so there are fewer limitations on price adjustment.



There are also variations on the speed of price limitations. For example, digitally managed and sold inventories have marginal menu costs, and updates to pricing can be made globally with a few clicks.



In general, high menu costs mean that prices are generally not updated until they must be. For many goods, the adjustment is usually up. When input costs drop, the marketers of a product tend to pocket the extra margin until competition forces them to reprice. This is usually done through promotional discounting rather than true price adjustment.


   Menu Costs FAQs  
  What Is Menu Cost Theory in Economics?  

Menu cost theory reflects the effect of a price change on a commercial enterprise. The classic example used to illustrate the theory is a restaurant that changes its prices must then bear the cost of printing new menus.



Menu costs, then, are the costs to a firm of changing nominal prices in general. Every time a firm raises or cuts the prices it charges, it faces a substantial financial outlay. Another aspect of menu costs is that prices must go up in line with inflation. Thus, menu costs are unavoidable to some extent.


  Which Types of Cost Can Be Included As Menu Costs?  

Any costs that occur as a result of a firm changing its prices can be included as menu costs. These costs could include printing menus, updating computer systems, re-tagging items, or hiring consultants to help with pricing strategy. Menu costs can also include consumer hesitancy to purchase at the new price.


  Are Menu Costs the Costs of Changing Prices?  

Yes. Menu costs result from the cost of changing prices. Purveyors must change their prices, typically, to keep up with inflation, or they may reduce their prices to be more competitive in the market. Either way, there will be associated costs for doing so.


  Why Do Menu Costs Arise?  

Menu costs usually are the result of inflation. For example, if the cost of food, rent, or wages goes up, a restaurant will have to raise its prices to pay for the extra cost and to make the same profit. When raising prices, there are additional costs, such as printing new menus, updating the website, etc. This means the restaurant will incur extra costs simply because of inflation.


  How Can I Reduce My Menu Costs?  

The key to reducing menu costs is to have a good pricing strategy. Businesses should analyze their market and determine how they differ from their local competitors. This will show where their value lies where customers are concerned and can help them price their products effectively taking into account their competitor's products and prices. These steps should prevent a business from having to change its prices too frequently, or worse, reduce them.


  What Is an Example of Pricing That Changes Infrequently?  

Sticky prices exist when prices do not react or are slow to react to changes in demand, production costs, etc. Food in grocery stores tends to be sticky, at least for a time. For instance, if the price of tomatoes plummets, Chef Boyardee would more than likely not lower its prices, even though the input costs decreased. Instead, the food company would simply take the greater margin as profit. In this example, consumers notice no difference in price, even though it should have been lowered according to the classic laws of supply and demand.



This works the other way around, too. Olive Garden is unlikely to hike up its pasta prices because the price of one ingredient goes up. Other examples of sticky prices are hair cuts; health care; and entertainment items, such as books and movie tickets.
What Is Mercantilism?  

Mercantilism was an economic system of trade that spanned the 16th century to the 18th century. Mercantilism was based on the principle that the world's wealth was static, and consequently, governments had to regulate trade to build their wealth and national power. Many European nations attempted to accumulate the largest possible share of that wealth by maximizing their exports and limiting their imports via tariffs.





Key Takeaways

Mercantilism was the dominant economic system from the 16th century to the 18th century.Mercantilism was based on the idea that a nation's wealth and power were best served by increasing exports and reducing imports.It's characterized by the belief that global wealth was static and that a nation's economic health relied heavily on its supply of capital.Due to the nationalistic nature of mercantilism, nations frequently used military might to protect local markets and supply sources.Mercantilism was replaced by free-trade economic theory in the mid-18th century.

   Understanding Mercantilism  

Mercantilism was a form of economic nationalism that sought to increase the prosperity and power of a nation through restrictive trade practices. Its goal was to increase the supply of a state's gold and silver with exports rather than to deplete it through imports. It also sought to support domestic employment.



Mercantilism centered on the interests of merchants and producers (such as England's East India Company and the Dutch East India Company) and protected their activities as necessary. 



Mercantilism had several noteworthy characteristics.



1. The Belief in the Static Nature of Wealth



Financial wealth was considered limited (due to the rarity of precious metals). Nations that sought prosperity and power needed to secure as much wealth as possible, at the expense of other nations.



2. The Need to Increase the Supply of Gold



Gold represented wealth and power. It could pay for soldiers, seafaring exploration for natural resources, and expanding empires. It could also protect against invasion. A lack of gold meant the downfall of a nation.



3. The Need to Maintain a Trade Surplus



This was integral to building wealth. Nations needed to focus on selling their exports (and collecting the associated revenue) more than on spending on imports (and sending gold out of countries).



4. The Importance of a Large Population



Large populations represented wealth. Increasing a nation's population was integral to supplying a labor force, supporting domestic commerce, and maintaining armies.



5. The Use of Colonies to Support Wealth



Some nations needed colonies for raw materials, a labor supply, and a way to keep wealth within its control (by selling colonies the products their raw materials helped to produce). Essentially, colonies increased a nation's wealth-building power and national security.



6. The Use of Protectionism



Protecting a nation's ability to build and maintain trade surpluses encompassed prohibiting colonies from trading with other nations and imposing tariffs on imported goods.


   History of Mercantilism  

First seen in Europe during the 1500s, mercantilism was based on the idea that a nation's wealth and power were best served by increasing exports and limiting imports.



Mercantilism replaced the feudal economic system in Western Europe. At the time, England was the epicenter of the British Empire but had relatively few natural resources.



To grow its wealth, England introduced fiscal policies that discouraged colonists from buying foreign products and created incentives to buy only British goods. For example, the Sugar Act of 1764 raised duties on foreign refined sugar and molasses imported by the colonies. This increased taxation was meant to give British sugar growers in the West Indies a monopoly on the colonial market.



Similarly, the Navigation Act of 1651 forbade foreign vessels from trading along the British coast and required colonial exports to first pass through British control before being redistributed throughout Europe.



Programs like these resulted in a favorable balance of trade that increased Great Britain's national wealth.



Under mercantilism, nations frequently engaged their military might to ensure that local markets and supply sources were protected. Mercantilists also believed that a nation's economic health could be measured by its ownership of precious metals, such as gold or silver. Their levels tended to rise with increased new home construction, increased agricultural output, and a strong merchant fleet that serviced additional markets with goods and raw materials.


  French Mercantilism  

Arguably the most influential proponent of mercantilism, French Controller General of Finance Jean-Baptiste Colbert (1619-1683) studied foreign-trade economic theories. He was uniquely positioned to execute on mercantilist ideas. A devout monarchist, Colbert called for an economic strategy that protected the French crown from a rising Dutch mercantile class.



Colbert also increased the size of the French navy, on the belief that France had to control its trade routes to increase its wealth. Although his practices ultimately proved unsuccessful, his ideas were hugely popular. Ultimately, they became overshadowed by the theory of free-market economics.


  British Colonial Mercantilism  

The British colonies were subject to the direct and indirect effects of mercantilist policy at home. Here are several examples:



Controlled production and trade: Mercantilism led to the adoption of far-reaching trade restrictions, which stunted the growth and freedom of colonial businesses.
The expansion of the slave trade: Trade became triangulated between the British Empire, its colonies, and foreign markets. This fostered the development of the slave trade in many colonies, including America. The colonies provided rum, cotton, and other products demanded by African imperialists. In turn, slaves were returned to America or the West Indies and traded for sugar and molasses.
Inflation and taxation: The British government demanded that trading be conducted using gold and silver bullion, ever seeking a positive balance of trade. The colonies often had insufficient bullion left over to circulate in their own markets, so they issued paper currency to replace it. Mismanagement of printed currency resulted in inflationary periods. Additionally, since Great Britain was in a near-constant state of war, heavy taxation was needed to prop up its army and navy. The combination of taxes and inflation caused great colonial discontent.


  Colonial American Mercantilism  

Defenders of mercantilism argued that it created stronger economies by marrying the concerns of colonies with those of their founding countries. In theory, when British colonists created their own products and obtained others by trading with their founding nation, they remained independent from the influence of hostile nations.



Meanwhile, Great Britain benefited from receiving large amounts of raw material from the colonists that was necessary for a productive manufacturing sector.



Critics of mercantilism believed the restriction on international trade increased expenses, because all imports, regardless of product origin, had to be shipped by British ships. This radically spiked the costs of goods for the colonists, who believed the disadvantages of this system outweighed the benefits of affiliating with Great Britain.



After a costly war with France, the British Empire, hungry to replenish revenue, raised taxes on colonists, who rebelled by boycotting British products, consequently slashing imports by a full one-third. This was followed by the Boston Tea Party in 1773, where Boston colonists disguised as Indians raided three British ships. They emptied several hundred chests of tea into the harbor to protest British taxes on tea and the monopoly granted to the East India Company. To reinforce its mercantilist control, Great Britain pushed harder against the colonies. This resulted in the Revolutionary War.


   Merchants and Mercantilism  

By the early 16th century, European financial theorists understood the importance of the merchant class in generating wealth. Cities and countries with goods to sell thrived in the late middle ages.



Consequently, many believed the state should allow its leading merchants to create exclusive government-controlled monopolies and cartels. Governments used regulations, subsidies, and (if needed) military force to protect these monopolistic corporations from domestic and foreign competition.



Citizens could invest money in mercantilist corporations in exchange for ownership and limited liability in their royal charters. These citizens were granted shares of the company profit. In essence, these were the first traded corporate stocks.



The most famous and powerful mercantilist corporations were Britain's East India Company and the Dutch East India Company. For more than 250 years, the British East India Company maintained the exclusive, royally granted right to conduct trade between Britain, India, and China. Its trade routes were protected by the Royal Navy.






Mercantilism is considered by some scholars to be a precursor to capitalism since it rationalized economic activity such as profits and losses.


   Mercantilism vs. Imperialism  

Mercantilist governments manipulate a nation's economy to create favorable trade balances. Imperialism uses a combination of military force and mass immigration to foist mercantilism on less-developed regions. Military campaigns forced inhabitants to follow the dominant countries' laws. One of the most powerful examples of the relationship between mercantilism and imperialism is Britain's establishment of the American colonies. 


   Mercantilism vs. Capitalism  

Capitalism provides several advantages over mercantilism for individuals, businesses, and nations. With capitalism's free-trade system, individuals benefit from a greater choice of affordable goods. On the other hand, mercantilism restricts imports and reduces the choices available to consumers. Fewer imports mean less competition and higher prices.



Mercantilist countries engaged in warfare frequently to control resources. Nations operating under a free-trade system prospered by engaging in mutually beneficial trade relations.



In his seminal book The Wealth of Nations, legendary economist Adam Smith argued that free trade enabled businesses to specialize in producing the goods that they could manufacture most efficiently. This led to higher productivity and greater economic growth.


   Mercantilism Today  

Today, mercantilism is deemed outdated. The disaster of World War II underscored the potential danger of nationalistic policies. It also prodded the world toward global trading and relationships as a way to combat them.



However, it is hard to escape mercantilism. For example, after the war, barriers to trade were still used to protect locally entrenched industries. The United States adopted a protectionist trade policy toward Japan and negotiated voluntary export restrictions with the Japanese government, which limited Japanese exports to the United States.



Today, Russia and China still use a mercantilist system because it partners so well with their forms of government. They have relied heavily on their ability to control foreign trade, their balance of payments, and foreign reserves. They have also sought to make their exports relatively more attractive with lower pricing.



Due to the effects of globalization, many nations and their people suffer from feeling that they've lost wealth, control, and prestige. This has made the nationalism that is part of mercantilism more appealing. It helped bring to power the likes of Donald Trump in the U.S. and Narendra Modi in India.



In 2018, President Trump imposed tariffs on Chinese imports, launching a trade war that exists to this day.




What Were the Main Beliefs of Mercantilism?
Mercantilism's original foundation included beliefs that the world had limited wealth in the form of gold and silver; that nations had to build their stores of gold at the expense of others; that colonies were important for supplying labor and trading partners; that armies and navies were crucial to protecting trade practices; and that protectionism was required to guarantee trade surpluses.




What's the Difference Between Capitalism and Mercantilism?
One difference is the role that the state plays. Capitalism calls for a minimum of government intervention and ownership of capital, trade, and industry by private entities and individuals. Mercantilism involves state control and regulation. Capitalism is said to promote individual freedom. Mercantilism is said to suppress it.




Is Mercantilism Still Used Today?
Yes, to some extent it exists in certain countries whose governments seek to maintain control over property ownership, trade, and the creation of wealth.


   The Bottom Line  

The precursor to free trade economic theory, Mercantilism reigned supreme for three centuries. Mercantilism's theory relating to financial wealth building and state power supported the use of protectionism to increase export revenue and decrease imports. It sparked an age of exploration and colonization in an effort to secure raw materials, controllable trade partners, and a net transfer of wealth.



Mercantilism has been replaced in many parts of the world by free-trade theory and capitalism. However, it's still seen in the tariffs imposed by governments of nations seeking a fair (or unfair) balance of trade with other nations.
What Is Merchandising?  

Merchandising is the presentation and promotion of goods that are available for purchase for both wholesale and retail sales. This includes marketing strategies, display design, and competitive pricing, including discounting. Merchandising is important for retailers looking to cultivate their brand, improve the experience of customers, compete with others in the sector, and ultimately, drive sales.





Key Takeaway

Merchandising refers to the marketing and sales of products.Merchandising is most often synonymous with retail sales, where businesses sell products to consumers.Merchandising, more narrowly, may refer to the marketing, promotion, and advertising of products intended for retail sale.Technology is changing the face of merchandising, with electronic point-of-sale terminals to targeted and personalized mobile ads.Categories of merchandising include product, visual, retail, digital, and omnichannel.


   Understanding Merchandising  

Merchandising includes the determination of quantities, setting prices for goods, creating display designs, developing marketing strategies, and establishing discounts or coupons. More broadly, merchandising may refer to retail sales itself: the provision of goods to end-user consumers.



Cycles of merchandising are specific to cultures and climates. These cycles may accommodate school schedules and incorporate regional and seasonal holidays, as well as the predicted impact of weather.



Merchandising can take on different and more specific definitions in regard to different aspects of retail sales. For example, in marketing, merchandising can refer to the use of one product, image, or brand to sell another product, image, or brand.






The word merchandise comes from the Old French word marchandise, from marchand, which means "merchant."


   Special Considerations  

Since retailers may or may not be producers of the goods they sell, measuring the gross value of all sales provides insight into the company’s performance. This is especially true in the customer-to-customer market, where the retailer serves as a third-party mechanism for connecting buyers and sellers without actually participating as either.



Merchandising may also provide value to retailers in the consignment sector. In this sector, retailers never officially purchase their inventory. Even though the items are often housed within a company’s retail location, the business functions as the authorized reseller, often for a fee, of another person’s or entity’s merchandise or property. Generally, they are never the true owner of the item because the person or entity that placed the item on consignment may return and claim the item if they so choose.



Gross merchandise value is the total value of merchandise sold over a given period of time through a customer-to-customer exchange site. It is a measure of the growth of the business.



All around the world, but most notably in the United States, the reality of merchandising is getting an update. The roles and rules of merchandising are experiencing an evolution. Chief merchants, formerly concerned mainly with the selection and presentation of products, now have broader accountability and a heavier hand in customer experience, as well as the development of design and talent related to display and marketing design.






Because consumer savvy is broadening, and technology is playing such a massive role in merchandising, companies need to stay ahead of consumers’ expectations. Innovation and experimentation have a central role in retailers' merchandising strategies.


   U.S. Retail Cycles  

In the United States, the routine retail cycle starts at the beginning of January. During this time, merchandising includes the promotion of Valentine's Day and St. Patrick's Day products and related items. Shortly following this, Presidents' Day is represented through special sales and discounts.



The next major holiday in the United States is Easter. During this time, not only is the holiday promoted but so is springtime and the associated warmer weather. Most promoted products at that time of year include clothing items appropriate for warmer weather, in addition to tools and other items suited for outdoor activities, such as gardening and picnics. These items are typically made available mid-winter and heavily marketed and promoted to move such items from shelves to make room for the next batch of products.



The cycle continues through the rest of the year in the same manner, accounting for Mother's Day, Memorial Day, graduation season, Father's Day, the Fourth of July, Labor Day, Halloween, Thanksgiving, and Christmas.



Retail is the largest private-sector employer in the United States, responsible for one out of every four jobs, or 52 million American workers.






Merchandising typically varies within retail chains but will vary greatly depending upon the region of the country (and within states themselves).


   Merchandising Company vs. Service Company  

As the name suggests, a merchandising company engages in the sale of tangible goods to consumers. These businesses incur costs, such as labor and materials, to present and ultimately sell products.



Service companies do not sell tangible goods to produce income; rather, they provide services to customers or clients who value their innovation and expertise. Examples of service companies include consultants, accountants, financial planners, and insurance providers.


   Merchandising Strategies  

Merchandisers employ a number of different strategies to attract buyers to make purchases, including window and in-store displays, strategic grouping of products, well-stocked shelves that have clear signage, the highlighting of certain promotional products, samples and other freebies, in-store demonstrations, and other in-store advertisements. Cleanliness and neatness are also important, as they are synonymous with professionalism. A business's online store should also use merchandising strategies to appeal to online shoppers.


   Benefits of Merchandising  

Merchandising is critical for a retailer, as it can directly impact sales and customer retention. Whether a store has a physical presence, and/or an online presence, how the store presents itself and its products is crucial. In a physical store, cleanliness, organization, ease of accessibility, and the strategic use of discounts and offers can be the difference between a customer that casually browses once and one that becomes a repeat purchaser.



Effective merchandising can help a retailer grow its brand, compete with others in its same category, and stay competitive even when the economy is struggling.




What Are the Types of Merchandising Companies?
Merchandising, broadly speaking, refers to any entity that engages in selling a product. Under this definition, there are two types of merchandising companies, namely retail and wholesale. Retailers sell their products directly to consumers, while wholesalers buy from manufacturers and sell to retailers.




What Does Merchandising Entail?
Essentially, merchandising is the promotion and sale of products. It often is used to mean retail sales itself in that its goal is to influence the buying decisions of consumers. However, it should not be confused with the sale itself. It is the process leading up to a sale. It includes the determination of quantities, setting prices for goods and services, creating display designs, developing marketing strategies, and establishing discounts or coupons.




What Is the Difference Between a Merchandising and a Service Company?
A merchandising company, both wholesale and retail, sells tangible goods to its consumer. These companies incur costs, such as labor and materials, to present and ultimately sell products. Service companies do not sell tangible goods to produce income. Instead, they provide their expertise as a service to their clients. Examples of service companies include consultants, accountants, and financial planners.




What Are the Four Main Categories of Retail Merchandise?
There are essentially four types of retail merchandise, and most retailers specialize in one of the four classes. However, especially savvy retailers merchandise their stores with products from all four categories. Shopping products are the main class of retail merchandise, comprising products consumers want, are willing to research and comparison shop for, andare generally in demand for either a consumer or business audience.Convenience products that consumers can't live without, such as food, health, and hygiene products and basic household goods comprise the second category. The third category constitutes impulse purchases, such as candy, magazines, or drinks; these products are usually near the checkout aisle in supermarkets or so-called big-box retailers. Finally, there are specialty products, or unique, personalized, or otherwise more individualized products that are also available.
What Is a Merchant Bank?  

A merchant bank is a financial institution that conducts underwriting, loan services, financial advising, and fundraising services for large corporations and high-net-worth individuals *HNWI).



Merchant banks specialize in providing services for private corporations. Unlike retail or commercial banks, merchant banks do not typically provide financial services to the general public. Unlike investment banks, they focus on private companies not public companies. Examples of large merchant banks include JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs, and Citigroup.





Key Takeaways

Merchant banks are non-depository financial institutions that specialize in providing financial services to private corporations or specialty clients.Merchant banks provide loan services, financial advising, private equity, and fundraising services for large corporations and high-net-worth individuals.Merchant banks do not generally provide services for the general public, although they may have retail and commercial arms.Some examples of large merchant banks include JPMorgan Chase, Goldman Sachs, and Citigroup.

   How Merchant Banks Work  

Merchant banks are non-depository financial institutions and companies that deal with international finance for multinational corporations. These banks differ from other types of financial institutions in that they offer financial services such as private equity, fundraising, and business loans to private companies.



As such, most of their services are not targeted at the general public. While they may offer some banking services to wealthy individuals, merchant banks are more oriented toward corporate clients. They may have a retail banking arm, but they do not provide, for example, checking accounts.



The term merchant bank describes investment banks in the United Kingdom. Still, it has a more narrow definition in the U.S. Merchant banks may act like investment banks in the U.S. Still, they tend to focus on services tailored to multinational corporations and high-net-worth individuals who do business in more than one country.





Note

Unlike investment banks, merchant banks in the U.S. do not focus on publicly held companies.


   Functions of a Merchant Bank  

Merchant banks provide financial and advisory services to help corporate clients conduct business. They often work with companies that may not be large enough to raise funds from the public through an initial public offering (IPO).


  Financing and Loans  

Merchant banks traditionally perform international financing and underwriting including real estate, trade finance, and foreign investment. They may also issue letters of credit (LOCs).



Merchant banks can also provide more creative forms of financing. They can help corporations issue securities through private placement, which requires less regulatory disclosure and are sold to sophisticated investors.


  International Transactions  

If a multinational corporation operates in many different countries, a merchant bank can finance business operations in all of those countries and manage the currency exchanges. When a company seeks to make a major purchase in another country, it will seek a merchant bank that can transfer the funds to make the purchase using a letter of credit.


   Example of Merchant Banking  

Company ABC–based in the U.S., wants to buy Company XYZ in Germany. ABC would hire a merchant bank to facilitate the process. That bank would advise Company ABC on how to structure the transaction. It may also help ABC in the financing and underwriting process.



Using the example above, the sellers in Germany would receive a letter of credit issued by the merchant bank hired by Company ABC as payment for the purchase. The merchant can also help Company ABC work through the legal and regulatory issues required to do business in Germany.






Although merchant banks generally don't deal with the general public, some of the biggest merchant banks also have retail and commercial banking operations.


   Merchant Banks vs. Investment Banks  

Merchant and investment banks are similar. Investment banks underwrite and sell securities to the general public through IPOs. The bank’s clients are large corporations that are willing to invest the time and money necessary to register securities for sale to the public. Investment banks also provide advisory services to companies about mergers and acquisitions (M&A) and provide investment research to clients.



While merchant banks are fee-based, investment banks have a two-fold income structure. They may collect fees based on the advisory services they provide to their clients, but may also be fund-based, meaning they can earn income from interest and other leases.



Regardless of how a company sells securities, there are some minimum disclosure requirements to inform investors. Both IPOs and private placements can require a company audit by an external certified public accountant (CPA) firm, which provides an opinion on the financial statements. Potential investors can use this information about the risks and potential rewards to make decisions about buying or selling the securities.

What Is a Merchant Bank Account?
A merchant bank account is a bank account for business clients. These accounts are set up to receive debit and credit cards or other forms of electronic payment.




What Does Merchant Services Mean on a Bank Statement?
Merchant services providers are financial intermediaries between a bank and its business clients. They may help businesses handle payment processing, cash advances, online transactions, check writing and cashing, or other necessary services to maintain cash flow.




Can I Open an Account at a Merchant Bank?
Merchant banks are non-depository institutions that do not provide the same types of consumer services that are offered by a retail bank. Although merchant banks may also serve wealthy individuals, their services are more focused on providing financing and investment to commercial enterprises.


   The Bottom Line  

Merchant banks are institutions that provide loans and capital for business enterprises. They may also provide consulting services, or help their clients structure large international transactions. Merchant banks provide different services from both retail and investment banks. They may have retail banking divisions, but they typically don't provide banking services to the general public.
What Is the Merchant Discount Rate?  

The merchant discount rate (MDR) is a fee that merchants and other businesses must pay to a payment processing company on debit or credit card transactions. The MDR typically comes in the form of a percentage of the transaction amount. It is also referred to as a transaction discount rate (TDR) or simply a discount rate.





Key Takeaways

The merchant discount rate (MDR) is a fee charged to a business by the company that processes its debit and credit card transactions.Before they can accept debit and credit cards, merchants must set up this service and agree to the rate.The merchant discount rate is typically between 1% and 3%.Part of the merchant discount rate goes to the credit card issuer in the form of an interchange fee.Merchants must consider these fees as part of managing their business costs and setting their prices.In most states, merchants are allowed to impose a surcharge on debit and credit card users, in part to help cover their added costs.


   Understanding the Merchant Discount Rate  

When merchants and other businesses want to accept payments from debit or credit cards, they must first set up an account with a payment processing company. Payment processors serve as intermediaries between a business and the various banks that issue debit and credit cards. The merchant discount rate is what the business pays for their services.



Payment processors have well-established infrastructures and fee schedule arrangements in place to support all types of merchant payments. Most local and e-commerce merchants can expect to pay a 1% to 3% fee for payment processing of each transaction.


   How Payment Processing Works  

Payment processing companies help facilitate commerce across the world, in return for a cut of the action. In addition to point-of-sale (POS) and online services, many now offer options for extended payment plans, loans, and lines of credit.



Merchants have a range of options available for payment processing. They can use fintech company services, such as PayPal, Square, or Shopify. They can also set up payment processing with a traditional bank that offers such services. Among major banks' payment processing services are Chase POS Payment Solutions, U.S. Bank POS Solutions, and Bank of America Merchant Services. Most payment processors offer e-commerce and mobile payment processing in addition to processing for in-store transactions.





$160 Billion

That's the amount that retailers and their customers pay in credit and debit card processing fees each year, according to the National Retail Federation.


   How Much Merchants Pay for Payment Processing  

Merchants and other businesses have numerous payment processing providers to choose from and these providers offer varying fee schedules, depending on the size of business and types of transactions. Merchant discount rates for e-commerce transactions are typically higher due to added security costs.



For example, Chase POS Payment Solutions, which calls itself the "#1 payment processor in the U.S.," recently posted these rates on its website:



2.6% + 10 cents per tap, dip, or swipe transaction2.9% + 25 cents per online transaction3.5% + 10 cents per keyed-in transaction



Chase added that "custom pricing" was also available.



While payment processors typically charge for each transaction at the applicable merchant discount rate, some charge a flat monthly fee. Fintech processors typically offer lower costs, and bank processing fees are usually higher. While the merchant may pay a single fee, that fee will typically be split among the payment processor, the credit card issuing bank, and sometimes other parties.




What Is an Interchange Fee?
An interchange fee (sometimes referred to simply as "interchange") is a portion of the merchant discount rate that the payment processor pays to the issuer of the card used in a particular transaction, typically a bank. In addition to the interest they charge cardholders, credit card issuers make much of their money through interchange fees. These fees are also commonly referred to as "swipe fees."




Can Merchants Charge Extra for Using a Credit Card?
In most states in the U.S., merchants are allowed to change customers extra for using a card rather than cash, in effect covering some or all of the merchant discount rate they have to pay on the transaction. This is commonly known as a surcharge and is typically calculated as a percentage of the transaction amount. In some cases merchants can also charge convenience fees, typically a flat amount, for much the same purpose.




Can a Merchant Give You a Discount if You Pay in Cash?
Yes, as an alternative to charging more for using a debit or credit card, merchants can give customers a discount for paying in cash. This practice is legal in all 50 states of the U.S.




Do Merchants Pay More When You Use Credit vs. Debit?
Merchants tend to pay lower fees when the customer uses a debit card rather than a credit card. According to the National Retail Federation, swipe fees for credit cards average about 2%, while "Fees for debit cards from the nation's largest banks are capped by the Federal Reserve at 21 cents per transaction plus 0.05% of the transaction amount." Debit cards from small banks, it adds, are exempt from that restriction.




Why Do Merchants Pay Higher Fees for Online Transactions?
According to the credit card companies, online transactions involve more financial risk than in-person transactions, where both the customer and their physical card are on hand. The higher merchant discount rates for online transactions are said to reflect that. In the jargon of the credit industry, these are often referred to as "card present" vs. "card-not-present" transactions.


   The Bottom Line  

Today's electronic payment networks offer customers the option to make purchases using a variety of credit and debit cards. This is a convenience for consumers and an advantage for merchants who want to sell more of their goods. Merchants pay a fee for the services that make this possible. Consumers may also pay if the merchant builds that fee into the prices it charges.
What Is a Merger?  

A merger is an agreement that unites two existing companies into one new company. There are several types of mergers and also several reasons why companies complete mergers. Mergers and acquisitions (M&A) are commonly done to expand a company’s reach, expand into new segments, or gain market share. All of these are done to increase shareholder value. Often, during a merger, companies have a no-shop clause to prevent purchases or mergers by additional companies.





Key Takeaways

Mergers are a way for companies to expand their reach, expand into new segments, or gain market share.A merger is the voluntary fusion of two companies on broadly equal terms into one new legal entity.The five major types of mergers are conglomerate, congeneric, market extension, horizontal, and vertical.

   How a Merger Works  

A merger is the voluntary fusion of two companies on broadly equal terms into one new legal entity. The firms that agree to merge are roughly equal in terms of size, customers, and scale of operations. For this reason, the term "merger of equals" is sometimes used. Acquisitions, unlike mergers, or generally not voluntary and involve one company actively purchasing another.



Mergers are most commonly done to gain market share, reduce costs of operations, expand to new territories, unite common products, grow revenues, and increase profits—all of which should benefit the firms' shareholders. After a merger, shares of the new company are distributed to existing shareholders of both original businesses.



Due to a large number of mergers, a mutual fund was created, giving investors a chance to profit from merger deals—called The Merger Fund from Virtus Investment Partners. The fund captures the spread or amount left between the offer price and the trading price. It invests in companies that have publicly announced a merger or takeover. The fund has returned 5.8% annually since its inception in 1989 (as of 3/31/2022).






The total value of mergers and acquisitions for 2022 rose to $2.6 trillion.


   Types of Mergers  

There are various types of mergers, depending on the goal of the companies involved. Below are some of the most common types of mergers.


  Conglomerate  

This is a merger between two or more companies engaged in unrelated business activities. The firms may operate in different industries or in different geographical regions. A pure conglomerate involves two firms that have nothing in common. A mixed conglomerate, on the other hand, takes place between organizations that, while operating in unrelated business activities, are actually trying to gain product or market extensions through the merger.



Companies with no overlapping factors will only merge if it makes sense from a shareholder wealth perspective, that is, if the companies can create synergy, which includes enhancing value, performance, and cost savings. A conglomerate merger was formed when The Walt Disney Company merged with the American Broadcasting Company (ABC) in 1995.


  Congeneric  

A congeneric merger is also known as a Product Extension merger. In this type, it is a combining of two or more companies that operate in the same market or sector with overlapping factors, such as technology, marketing, production processes, and research and development (R&D). A product extension merger is achieved when a new product line from one company is added to an existing product line of the other company. When two companies become one under a product extension, they are able to gain access to a larger group of consumers and, thus, a larger market share. An example of a congeneric merger is Citigroup's 1998 union with Travelers Insurance, two companies with complementing products.


  Market Extension  

This type of merger occurs between companies that sell the same products but compete in different markets. Companies that engage in a market extension merger seek to gain access to a bigger market and, thus, a bigger client base. To extend their markets, Eagle Bancshares and RBC Centura merged in 2002.






A merger is the voluntary fusion of two companies on broadly equal terms into a new legal entity.


  Horizontal  

A horizontal merger occurs between companies operating in the same industry. The merger is typically part of consolidation between two or more competitors offering the same products or services. Such mergers are common in industries with fewer firms, and the goal is to create a larger business with greater market share and economies of scale since competition among fewer companies tends to be higher. The 1998 merger of Daimler-Benz and Chrysler is considered a horizontal merger.


  Vertical  

When two companies that produce parts or services for a product merger, the union is referred to as a vertical merger. A vertical merger occurs when two companies operating at different levels within the same industry's supply chain combine their operations. Such mergers are done to increase synergies achieved through the cost reduction, which results from merging with one or more supply companies. One of the most well-known examples of a vertical merger took place in 2000 when internet provider America Online (AOL) combined with media conglomerate Time Warner.


   Examples of Mergers  

Anheuser-Busch InBev (BUD) is an example of how mergers work and unite companies together. The company is the result of multiple mergers, consolidation, and market extensions in the beer market. The newly named company, Anheuser-Busch InBev, is the result of the mergers of three large international beverage companies—Interbrew (Belgium), Ambev (Brazil), and Anheuser-Busch (United States).



Ambev merged with Interbrew uniting the number three and five largest brewers in the world. When Ambev and Anheuser-Busch merged, it united the number one and two largest brewers in the world. This example represents both horizontal merger and market extension as it was industry consolidation but also extended the international reach of all the combined company’s brands.



The largest mergers in history have totaled over $100 billion each. In 2000, Vodafone acquired Mannesmann for $181 billion to create the world’s largest mobile telecommunications company. In 2000, AOL and Time Warner vertically merged in a $164 billion deal considered one of the biggest flops ever. In 2014, Verizon Communications bought out Vodafone’s 45% stake in Vodafone Wireless for $130 billion.




What Is a Horizontal Merger?
A horizontal merger is when competing companies merge—companies that sell the same products or services. The T-Mobile and Sprint merger is an  example of a horizontal merger. Meanwhile, a vertical merger is a merger of companies with different products, such as the AT&T and Time Warner combination.




What Is an SPAC Merger?
A special-purpose acquisition company (SPAC) merger generally takes place when a publicly-traded SPAC uses the public markets to raise capital to buy an operating company. The operating company mergers with an SPAC and becomes a publicly-listed company.




What Is a Reverse Merger?
A reverse merger, also known as a reverse takeover (RTO), is when a private company purchases a publicly-traded company. The New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) completed a reverse merger with Archipelago Holdings in 2006.
What Is Merger Arbitrage?  

Merger arbitrage, often considered a hedge fund strategy, involves simultaneously purchasing and selling the respective stock of two merging companies to create "riskless" profits. Because there is the uncertainty of the deal being completed, the stock price of the target company typically sells at a price below the acquisition price. A merger arbitrageur will review the probability of a merger not closing on time or at all and will then purchase the stock before the acquisition, expecting to make a profit when the merger or acquisition completes.





Key Takeaways

Merger arbitrage is an investment strategy whereby an investor simultaneously purchases the stock of merging companies.A merger arbitrage takes advantage of market inefficiencies surrounding mergers and acquisitions.Merger arbitrage, also known as risk arbitrage, is a subset of event-driven investing or trading, which involves exploiting market inefficiencies before or after a merger or acquisition. 


   Understanding Merger Arbitrage  

Merger arbitrage, also known as risk arbitrage, is a subset of event-driven investing or trading, which involves exploiting market inefficiencies before or after a merger or acquisition. A regular portfolio manager often focuses on the profitability of the merged entity.



By contrast, merger arbitrageurs focus on the probability of the deal being approved and how long it will take to finalize the deal. Since there is a probability the deal may not be approved, merger arbitrage carries some risk.






Merger arbitrage is a strategy that focuses on the merger event rather than the overall performance of the stock market.


   Special Considerations  

When a corporation announces its intent to acquire another corporation, the acquiring company's stock price typically decreases, and the target company's stock price increases. To secure the shares of the target company, the acquiring firm must offer more than the current value of the shares. The acquiring firm's stock price declines because of market speculation about the target firm or the price offered for the target firm.



However, the target company's stock price typically remains below the announced acquisition price, which is reflective of the deal's uncertainty. In an all-cash merger, investors generally take a long position in the target firm.



If a merger arbitrageur expects a merger deal to break, the arbitrageur may short shares of the target company's stock. If a merger deal breaks, the target company's share price typically falls to its share price prior to the deal announcement. Mergers may break due to a multitude of reasons, such as regulations, financial instability, or unfavorable tax implications.


   Types of Merger Arbitrage  

There are two main types of corporate mergers—cash and stock mergers. In a cash merger, the acquiring company purchases the target company's shares for cash. Alternatively, a stock-for-stock merger involves the exchange of the acquiring company's stock for the target company's stock.



In a stock-for-stock merger, a merger arbitrageur typically buys shares of the target company's stock while shorting shares of the acquiring company's stock. If the deal is thus completed and the target company’s stock is converted into the acquiring company’s stock, the merger arbitrageur could use the converted stock to cover the short position.



A merger arbitrageur could also replicate this strategy using options, such as purchasing shares of the target company's stock while purchasing put options on the acquiring company's stock.
What Are Mergers and Acquisitions (M&A)?

The term mergers and acquisitions (M&A) refers to the consolidation of companies or their major business assets through financial transactions between companies. A company may purchase and absorb another company outright, merge with it to create a new company, acquire some or all of its major assets, make a tender offer for its stock, or stage a hostile takeover. All are M&A activities.



The term M&A also is used to describe the divisions of financial institutions that deal in such activity.





Key Takeaways

The terms "mergers" and "acquisitions" are often used interchangeably, but they differ in meaning.In an acquisition, one company purchases another outright.A merger is the combination of two firms, which subsequently form a new legal entity under the banner of one corporate name.A company can be objectively valued by studying comparable companies in an industry and using metrics.


   Understanding Mergers and Acquisitions  

The terms mergers and acquisitions are often used interchangeably, however, they have slightly different meanings.



When one company takes over another and establishes itself as the new owner, the purchase is called an acquisition.



On the other hand, a merger describes two firms, of approximately the same size, that join forces to move forward as a single new entity, rather than remain separately owned and operated. This action is known as a merger of equals. Case in point: Both Daimler-Benz and Chrysler ceased to exist when the two firms merged, and a new company, DaimlerChrysler, was created. Both companies' stocks were surrendered, and new company stock was issued in its place. In a brand refresh, the company underwent another name and ticker change as the Mercedes-Benz Group AG (MBG) in February 2022.



A purchase deal will also be called a merger when both CEOs agree that joining together is in the best interest of both of their companies.



Unfriendly or hostile takeover deals, in which target companies do not wish to be purchased, are always regarded as acquisitions. A deal can be classified as a merger or an acquisition based on whether the acquisition is friendly or hostile and how it is announced. In other words, the difference lies in how the deal is communicated to the target company's board of directors, employees, and shareholders.






M&A deals generate sizable profits for the investment banking industry, but not all mergers or acquisition deals close.


   Types of Mergers and Acquisitions  

The following are some common transactions that fall under the M&A umbrella.


  Mergers  

In a merger, the boards of directors for two companies approve the combination and seek shareholders' approval. For example, in 1998, a merger deal occurred between the Digital Equipment Corporation and Compaq, whereby Compaq absorbed the Digital Equipment Corporation. Compaq later merged with Hewlett-Packard in 2002. Compaq's pre-merger ticker symbol was CPQ. This was combined with Hewlett-Packard's ticker symbol (HWP) to create the current ticker symbol (HPQ).


  Acquisitions  

In a simple acquisition, the acquiring company obtains the majority stake in the acquired firm, which does not change its name or alter its organizational structure. An example of this type of transaction is Manulife Financial Corporation's 2004 acquisition of John Hancock Financial Services, wherein both companies preserved their names and organizational structures.


  Consolidations  

Consolidation creates a new company by combining core businesses and abandoning the old corporate structures. Stockholders of both companies must approve the consolidation, and subsequent to the approval, receive common equity shares in the new firm. For example, in 1998, Citicorp and Travelers Insurance Group announced a consolidation, which resulted in Citigroup.


  Tender Offers  

In a tender offer, one company offers to purchase the outstanding stock of the other firm at a specific price rather than the market price. The acquiring company communicates the offer directly to the other company's shareholders, bypassing the management and board of directors. For example, in 2008, Johnson & Johnson made a tender offer to acquire Omrix Biopharmaceuticals for $438 million. The company agreed to the tender offer and the deal was settled by the end of December 2008.


  Acquisition of Assets  

In an acquisition of assets, one company directly acquires the assets of another company. The company whose assets are being acquired must obtain approval from its shareholders. The purchase of assets is typical during bankruptcy proceedings, wherein other companies bid for various assets of the bankrupt company, which is liquidated upon the final transfer of assets to the acquiring firms.


  Management Acquisitions  

In a management acquisition, also known as a management-led buyout (MBO), a company's executives purchase a controlling stake in another company, taking it private. These former executives often partner with a financier or former corporate officers in an effort to help fund a transaction. Such M&A transactions are typically financed disproportionately with debt, and the majority of shareholders must approve it. For example, in 2013, Dell Corporation announced that it was acquired by its founder, Michael Dell.


   How Mergers Are Structured  

Mergers can be structured in a number of different ways, based on the relationship between the two companies involved in the deal:



Horizontal merger: Two companies that are in direct competition and share the same product lines and markets.
Vertical merger: A customer and company or a supplier and company. Think of an ice cream maker merging with a cone supplier.
Congeneric mergers: Two businesses that serve the same consumer base in different ways, such as a TV manufacturer and a cable company.
Market-extension merger: Two companies that sell the same products in different markets.
Product-extension merger: Two companies selling different but related products in the same market.
Conglomeration: Two companies that have no common business areas.



Mergers may also be distinguished by following two financing methods, each with its own ramifications for investors.


  Purchase Mergers  

As the name suggests, this kind of merger occurs when one company purchases another company. The purchase is made with cash or through the issue of some kind of debt instrument. The sale is taxable, which attracts the acquiring companies, who enjoy the tax benefits. Acquired assets can be written up to the actual purchase price, and the difference between the book value and the purchase price of the assets can depreciate annually, reducing taxes payable by the acquiring company.


  Consolidation Mergers  

With this merger, a brand new company is formed, and both companies are bought and combined under the new entity. The tax terms are the same as those of a purchase merger.


   How Acquisitions Are Financed  

A company can buy another company with cash, stock, assumption of debt, or a combination of some or all of the three. In smaller deals, it is also common for one company to acquire all of another company's assets. Company X buys all of Company Y's assets for cash, which means that Company Y will have only cash (and debt, if any). Of course, Company Y becomes merely a shell and will eventually liquidate or enter other areas of business.



Another acquisition deal known as a reverse merger enables a private company to become publicly listed in a relatively short time period. Reverse mergers occur when a private company that has strong prospects and is eager to acquire financing buys a publicly listed shell company with no legitimate business operations and limited assets. The private company reverses merges into the public company, and together they become an entirely new public corporation with tradable shares.


   How Mergers and Acquisitions Are Valued  

Both companies involved on either side of an M&A deal will value the target company differently. The seller will obviously value the company at the highest price possible, while the buyer will attempt to buy it for the lowest price possible. Fortunately, a company can be objectively valued by studying comparable companies in an industry, and by relying on the following metrics.


  Price-to-Earnings Ratio (P/E Ratio)  

With the use of a price-to-earnings ratio (P/E ratio), an acquiring company makes an offer that is a multiple of the earnings of the target company. Examining the P/E for all the stocks within the same industry group will give the acquiring company good guidance for what the target's P/E multiple should be.


  Enterprise-Value-to-Sales Ratio (EV/Sales)  

With an enterprise-value-to-sales ratio (EV/sales), the acquiring company makes an offer as a multiple of the revenues while being aware of the price-to-sales (P/S ratio) of other companies in the industry.


  Discounted Cash Flow (DCF)  

A key valuation tool in M&A, a discounted cash flow (DFC) analysis determines a company's current value, according to its estimated future cash flows. Forecasted free cash flows (net income + depreciation/amortization (capital expenditures) change in working capital) are discounted to a present value using the company's weighted average cost of capital (WACC). Admittedly, DCF is tricky to get right, but few tools can rival this valuation method.


  Replacement Cost  

In a few cases, acquisitions are based on the cost of replacing the target company. For simplicity's sake, suppose the value of a company is simply the sum of all its equipment and staffing costs. The acquiring company can literally order the target to sell at that price, or it will create a competitor for the same cost.



Naturally, it takes a long time to assemble good management, acquire property, and purchase the right equipment. This method of establishing a price certainly wouldn't make much sense in a service industry wherein the key assets (people and ideas) are hard to value and develop.


   Frequently Asked Questions  


How Do Mergers Differ From Acquisitions?
In general, "acquisition" describes a transaction, wherein one firm absorbs another firm via a takeover. The term "merger" is used when the purchasing and target companies mutually combine to form a completely new entity. Because each combination is a unique case with its own peculiarities and reasons for undertaking the transaction, the use of these terms tends to overlap.




Why Do Companies Keep Acquiring Other Companies Through M&A?
Two of the key drivers of capitalism are competition and growth. When a company faces competition, it must both cut costs and innovate at the same time. One solution is to acquire competitors so that they are no longer a threat. Companies also complete M&A to grow by acquiring new product lines, intellectual property, human capital, and customer bases. Companies may also look for synergies. By combining business activities, overall performance efficiency tends to increase, and across-the-board costs tend to drop as each company leverages the other company's strengths.




What Is a Hostile Takeover?
Friendly acquisitions are most common and occur when the target firm agrees to be acquired; its board of directors and shareholders approve of the acquisition, and these combinations often work for the mutual benefit of the acquiring and target companies.Unfriendly acquisitions, commonly known as hostile takeovers, occur when the target company does not consent to the acquisition.Hostile acquisitions don't have the same agreement from the target firm, and so the acquiring firm must actively purchase large stakes of the target company to gain a controlling interest, which forces the acquisition.




How Does M&A Activity Affect Shareholders?
Generally speaking, in the days leading up to a merger or acquisition, shareholders of the acquiring firm will see a temporary drop in share value. At the same time, shares in the target firm typically experience a rise in value. This is often due to the fact that the acquiring firm will need to spend capital to acquire the target firm at a premium to the pre-takeover share prices.After a merger or acquisition officially takes effect, the stock price usually exceeds the value of each underlying company during its pre-takeover stage. In the absence of unfavorable economic conditions, shareholders of the merged company usually experience favorable long-term performance and dividends.Note that the shareholders of both companies may experience a dilution of voting power due to the increased number of shares released during the merger process. This phenomenon is prominent in stock-for-stock mergers, when the new company offers its shares in exchange for shares in the target company, at an agreed-upon conversion rate. Shareholders of the acquiring company experience a marginal loss of voting power, while shareholders of a smaller target company may see a significant erosion of their voting powers in the relatively larger pool of stakeholders.




What Is the Difference Between a Vertical and Horizontal Merger or Acquisition?
Horizontal integration and vertical integration are competitive strategies that companies use to consolidate their position among competitors. Horizontal integration is the acquisition of a related business. A company that opts for horizontal integration will take over another company that operates at the same level of the value chain in an industry—for instance when Marriott International, Inc. acquired Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide, Inc.Vertical integration refers to the process of acquiring business operations within the same production vertical. A company that opts for vertical integration takes complete control over one or more stages in the production or distribution of a product. Apple, for example, acquired AuthenTec, which makes the touch ID fingerprint sensor technology that goes into its iPhones.
What Is Merrill Lynch & Co.?  

Merrill Lynch & Co. is the former name of a prominent Wall Street investment firm. Since its acquisition by Bank of America (BAC) in 2009, it has become known simply as “Merrill” and operates as a wealth management division of Bank of America.



Founded by Charles E. Merrill in 1914, Merrill Lynch & Co. has long been one of the American financial sector's iconic institutions.





Key Takeaways:

Merrill Lynch & Co. is a long-established American financial firm.It was acquired by Bank of America in 2009 in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis.Prior to its acquisition by Bank of America, the company was a leading player in the subprime mortgage market, which collapsed in 2007.


   Understanding Merrill Lynch & Co.  

Today, Merrill Lynch & Co. is headquartered at 250 Vesey Street in Manhattan, New York. Part of Bank of America, the firm holds assets under management (AUM) of over $2.75 trillion and employs over 19,000 financial advisors.﻿﻿



While today it is focused on its wealth management business, Merrill Lynch & Co. is recognized for its investment banking activities. In June 1971, Merrill Lynch & Co. completed its initial public offering (IPO) and began trading on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE).



During the early 2000s, Merrill Lynch & Co. became a leader in the market for mortgage-backed collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) following its acquisition of the subprime lending firm First Franklin Financial in 2006. 






Merrill Lynch & Co. gradually expanded its service offerings by acquiring and merging with various other firms. The company has been engaged in retail brokerage services, prime brokering, broker-dealer activities, and commodities trading, among others.


  Bank of America and Merrill Lynch & Co.  

The company became the subject of widespread concern during the 2007 to 2008 financial crisis. In November 2007, Merrill Lynch & Co. announced billions in losses related to its portfolio of subprime mortgages and related derivative products. Following the termination of its chief executive officer (CEO), the company began selling company assets in a bid to maintain its solvency amidst speculation that it was on the verge of collapse.



In September 2008, Bank of America proposed a takeover of Merrill Lynch & Co. with an offer value of over $40 billion. This takeover offer, which represented a premium of over 70% relative to the company’s then-depressed market price, was accepted shortly thereafter, and Bank of America ultimately acquired Merrill Lynch for a $50 billion all stock transaction.


  Merrill Lynch Changes Due to Digitalization  

According to Financial Planning, the company plans to cut payouts to its advisors that manage small account holders in 2021 in an effort to maintain stability. Advisors will not receive a payout for production credits generated in households under $250,000.



This change echoes a trend among the biggest brokerage firms, which are encouraging advisors to cater to larger clients and move smaller accounts to robo-advisors or self-directed platforms.



This action is a reflection of the digital transformation that has occurred in the fintech sector. A senior Merrill executive stated: “That [shift] really reflects where our business is today and where it is going.”
What Is the Merton Model?  

The Merton model is a mathematical formula that stock analysts and commercial loan officers, among others, can use to judge a corporation’s risk of credit default. Named for economist Robert C. Merton, who proposed it in 1974, the Merton model assesses the structural credit risk of a company by modeling its equity as a call option on its assets.





Key Takeaways

In 1974, economist Robert C. Merton proposed a model for assessing the credit risk of a company by modeling its equity as a call option on its assets.The Merton model is used today by stock analysts, commercial loan officers, and others.Merton’s work, and that of fellow economist Myron S. Scholes, earned the Nobel Prize for economics in 1997.

   What Does the Merton Model Tell You?  

The Merton model allows for easier valuation of a company and helps analysts determine if it will be able to retain solvency, by analyzing the maturity dates of its debt and its debt totals.



The Merton model calculates the theoretical pricing of European put and call options without considering dividends paid out during the life of the option. The model can, however, be adapted to consider dividends by calculating the ex-dividend date value of underlying stocks.



The Merton model makes the following basic assumptions:



All options are European options and are exercised only at the time of expiration.
No dividends are paid out.
Market movements are unpredictable (efficient markets).
No commissions are included.
Underlying stocks’ volatility and risk-free rates are constant.
Returns on underlying stocks are regularly distributed.



Variables that are taken into consideration in the formula include options’ strike prices, present underlying prices, risk-free interest rates, and the amount of time before expiration.


   History of the Merton Model  

Robert C. Merton is a noted American economist and Nobel Prize laureate, who purchased his first stock at age 10. He earned a bachelor of science in engineering at Columbia University, a master of science in applied mathematics at the California Institute of Technology, and a doctorate in economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), where he later became a professor.



During Merton’s time at MIT, he and fellow economists Fischer Black and Myron S. Scholes were all working on problems related to the pricing of options and often aided in each other’s work. Black and Scholes published a seminal paper on the topic, “The Pricing of Options and Corporate Liabilities,” in 1973. Merton’s “On the Pricing of Corporate Debt: The Risk Structure of Interest Rates,” published early the following year, described what has come to be known as the Merton model.



Merton and Scholes were awarded the Nobel Prize for economics in 1997 (Black had died and was no longer eligible). The prize committee cited them for developing “a pioneering formula for the valuation of stock options. Their methodology has paved the way for economic valuations in many areas. It has also generated new types of financial instruments and facilitated more efficient risk management in society.”



Their best known collaboration is often referred to today as the Black-Scholes-Merton model.




What is a call option?
A call option is a contract that allows the buyer to purchase a stock or other financial asset at a specified price by or on a certain date.




What is the difference between European and American options?
European options can be exercised only on their expiration date, while American options can be exercised at any time.




What is a risk-free interest rate?
A risk-free interest rate is the theoretical rate of return on an investment carrying zero risk. It is theoretical because no investment is entirely without risk, although some come closer than others.


   The Bottom Line  

The Merton model, developed by economist Robert C. Merton, is a mathematical formula that assesses the structural credit risk of a company by modeling its equity as a call option on its assets. It is often used by stock analysts and commercial loan officers to ascertain a corporation’s likely risk of credit default.
What Are Metrics?  

Metrics are measures of quantitative assessment commonly used for assessing, comparing, and tracking performance or production. Generally, a group of metrics will typically be used to build a dashboard that management or analysts review on a regular basis to maintain performance assessments, opinions, and business strategies.

   Understanding Metrics  

Metrics have been used in accounting, operations, and performance analysis throughout history.






Metrics come in a wide range of varieties with industry standards and proprietary models often governing their use.



Executives use them to analyze corporate finance and operational strategies. Analysts use them to form opinions and investment recommendations. Portfolio managers use metrics to guide their investing portfolios. Furthermore, project managers also find them essential in leading and managing strategic projects of all kinds.



Overall, metrics refer to a wide variety of data points generated from a multitude of methods. Best practices across industries have created a common set of comprehensive metrics used in ongoing evaluations. However, individual cases and scenarios typically guide the choice of metrics used.


   Choosing Metrics  

Every business executive, analyst, portfolio manager, and the project manager has a range of data sources available to them for building and structuring their own metric analysis. This can potentially make it difficult to choose the best metrics needed for important assessments and evaluations. Generally, managers seek to build a dashboard of what has come to be known as key performance indicators (KPIs).



In order to establish a useful metric, a manager must first assess its goals. From there, it is important to find the best outputs that measure the activities related to these goals. A final step is also setting goals and targets for KPI metrics that are integrated with business decisions.



Academics and corporate researchers have defined many industry metrics and methods that can help shape the building of KPIs and other metric dashboards. An entire decision analysis method called applied information economics was developed by Douglas Hubbard for analyzing metrics in a variety of business applications. Other popular decision analysis methods include cost-benefit analysis, forecasting, and Monte Carlo simulation.



Several businesses have also popularized certain methods that have become industry standards in many sectors. DuPont began using metrics to better their own business and in the process came up with the popular DuPont analysis which closely isolates variables involved in the return on equity (ROE) metric. GE has also commissioned a set of metrics known as Six Sigma that are commonly used today, with metrics tracked in six key areas: critical to quality; defects; process capability; variation; stable operations; and, design for Six Sigma.


   Examples of Metrics  

While there are a wide range of metrics, below are some commonly used tools:



Economic Metrics



Gross domestic product (GDP)
Inflation
Unemployment rate



Operational Company Metrics



From a comprehensive perspective, executives, industry analysts, and individual investors often look at key operational performance measures of a company, all from different perspectives. Some top-level operational metrics include measures derived from the analysis of a company’s financial statements. Key financial statement metrics include sales, earnings before interest and tax (EBIT), net income, earnings per share, margins, efficiency ratios, liquidity ratios, leverage ratios, and rates of return. Each of these metrics provides a different insight into the operational efficiency of a company.



Executives use these operational metrics to make corporate decisions involving costs, labor, financing, and investing. Executives and analysts also build complex financial models to identify future growth and value prospects, integrating both economic and operational metric forecasts.



There are several metrics that are key to comparing the financial position of companies against their competitors or the market overall. Two of these key comparable metrics, which are based on market value, include price-to-earnings ratio and price-to-book ratio.



Portfolio Management



Portfolio managers use metrics to identify investing allocations in a portfolio. All types of metrics are also used for analyzing and investing in securities that fit a specific portfolio strategy. For example, environmental, social and governance (ESG) criteria are a set of standards for a company's operations that socially conscious investors use to screen potential investments.



Project Management Metrics



In project management, metrics are essential in measuring project progression, output targets, and overall project success. Some of the areas where metric analysis is often needed include resources, cost, time, scope, quality, safety, and actions. Project managers have the responsibility to choose metrics that provide the best analysis and directional insight for a project. Metrics are followed in order to measure the overall progression, production, and performance.





Key Takeaways

Metrics are measures of quantitative assessment commonly used for comparing, and tracking performance or production.Metrics can be used in a variety of scenarios.Metrics are heavily relied on in the financial analysis of companies by both internal managers and external stakeholders.
What Is a Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA)?  

Metropolitan statistical areas (MSA) are delineated by the U.S. Office of Management and Budget (OMB) as having at least one urbanized area with a minimum population of 50,000.





Key Takeaways

Metropolitan statistical areas (MSA) are delineated by the U.S. OMB as having at least one urbanized area with a minimum population of 50,000.Metropolitan statistical area (MSA) is the formal definition of a region that consists of a city and surrounding communities that are linked by social and economic factors.Metropolitan statistical areas (MSA) serve to group counties and cities into specific geographic areas for population censuses and compilations of related statistical data.


   Understanding Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSA)  

A metropolitan statistical area (MSA), formerly known as a standard metropolitan statistical area (SMSA), is the formal definition of a region that consists of a city and surrounding communities that are linked by social and economic factors, as established by the U.S. Office of Management and Budget (OMB).



Metropolitan statistical areas serve to group counties and cities into specific geographic areas for population censuses and compilations of related statistical data. Modern MSAs are configured to represent contiguous geographic areas with a relatively high density of human population.



Metropolitan statistical areas usually consist of a core city with a large population and its surrounding region, which may include several adjacent counties. The area defined by the MSA is typically marked by significant social and economic interaction. People living in outlying rural areas, for example, may commute considerable distances to work, shop, or attend social activities in the urban center.



As of March 6, 2020 (latest information), per the OMB BULLETIN NO. 20-1, there are 392 regions that meet the requirements to be designated as metropolitan statistical areas (MSA) in the U.S. and Puerto Rico (384 in the United States and eight in Puerto Rico).



In contrast to micropolitan statistical areas, which center on towns and smaller communities with populations between 10,000–50,000, MSAs must include a city with a population of at least 50,000.



Some MSAs, such as Dallas-Fort Worth-Arlington, contain multiple cities with populations exceeding 50,000. The most populous MSA in the country, New York-Newark-Jersey City, spans portions of three adjacent states, New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania.


   MSA Data Uses  

The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) uses MSA data to analyze labor market conditions within a geographical area. Within a metropolitan statistical area, workers can presumably change jobs without having to move to a new location, creating a relatively stable labor force.



Statistical data about MSAs also helps government officials and businesses review information about per capita income, spending patterns, and unemployment rates. The resulting data can be used to formulate policies designed to stimulate economic growth in the region.



For example, the Atlanta-Sandy Springs-Alpharetta metropolitan statistical area exerts a significant influence on the economic health of the region. It is the most populous area of Georgia. Companies seeking to relocate or establish new companies in the Atlanta-Sandy Springs-Alpharetta region can use statistical data about the area to project the viability of their intended business.



Real estate investors also use MSA data to study housing trends and population movement. In addition, applicants for certain social services may need to prove income levels below a fixed percentage of the median gross income in their metropolitan statistical area to qualify for help, including low-income housing and other forms of support.




What Size Is a Metropolitan Statistical Area?
A metropolitan statistical area consists of a location that has at least one urbanized area and a population of at least 50,000 people.




What Is the Difference Between MSA and CSA?
A metropolitan statistical area (MSA) is an area with at least one urbanized area and a population of at least 50,000 people. This includes the core jurisdiction plus adjacent counties that have a high degree of social and economic relations with the core county. A combined statistical area (CSA) is two or more MSAs or micropolitan statistical areas with employment interchange measures of at least 15. "Employment interchange measures" means "the sum of the percentage of workers living in the smaller entity who work in the larger entity and the percentage of employment in the smaller entity that is accounted for by workers who reside in the larger entity."




What Is the Largest Metro Area in the World?
Tokyo is the largest metro area in the world with a total metropolitan population of 36.5 million.


   The Bottom Line  

A metropolitan statistical area (MSA) is determined by the U.S. Office of Management and Budget (OMB) as a location with at least one urbanized area and at least 50,000 people. MSAs are typically cities and their linked surrounding areas. MSAs help to group counties and cities into geographic areas for consensus purposes.
What Is Mezzanine Debt?  

Mezzanine debt occurs when a hybrid debt issue is subordinated to another debt issue from the same issuer. Mezzanine debt has embedded equity instruments attached, often known as warrants, which increase the value of the subordinated debt and allow greater flexibility when dealing with bondholders. Mezzanine debt is frequently associated with acquisitions and buyouts, for which it may be used to prioritize new owners ahead of existing owners in case of bankruptcy.





Key Takeaways

Mezzanine debt is when a hybrid debt issue is subordinate to another debt issue from the same issuer.Mezzanine debt bridges the gap between debt and equity financing and is one of the highest-risk forms of debt—being subordinate to pure debt but senior to pure equity.In practice, mezzanine debt behaves more like a stock than debt because the embedded options make the conversion of the debt into stock very attractive.Mezzanine debt offers some of the highest returns when compared to other debt types, often generating rates between 12% and 20% per year.

   Understanding Mezzanine Debt  

Mezzanine debt bridges the gap between debt and equity financing and is one of the highest-risk forms of debt. It is senior to pure equity but subordinate to pure debt. However, this means that it also offers some of the highest returns when compared to other debt types, as it often receives rates between 12% and 20% per year.


   Types of Mezzanine Debt  

The types of equity included with the debt can be many. Some examples of embedded options include stock call options, rights, and warrants. In practice, mezzanine debt behaves more like a stock than debt because the embedded options make the conversion of the debt into stock very attractive.



Mezzanine debt structures are most common in leveraged buyouts. For example, a private equity firm may seek to purchase a company for $100 million with debt, but the lender only wants to put up 80% of the value, offering a loan of $80 million. The private equity firm does not want to put up $20 million of its own capital and instead looks for a mezzanine investor to finance $15 million.



Then, the firm only has to invest $5 million of its own dollars to meet the $100 million price tag. Since the investor used mezzanine debt, they'll be able to convert the debt to equity when certain requirements are met. Using this method of financing leverages the buyer's potential return while minimizing the amount of capital it has to put up for the transaction. 



Under U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), a hybrid security classification on the balance sheet is dependent on how the embedded option is influenced by the debt portion. If the act of exercising the embedded option is influenced by the structure of the debt in any way, then the two parts of the hybrid—the debt and the embedded equity option—must be classified in both the liability and stockholders' equity sections of the balance sheet.


   Example of Mezzanine Debt  

Mezzanine debt is most often used in mergers and acquisitions (M&A). For example, in 2016, Olympus Partners, a private equity firm based in Conn., received debt financing from Antares Capital to acquire AmSpec Holding Corp, a company that provides testing, inspection, and certification services for petroleum traders and refiners.



The total amount of the financing was $215 million, which included a revolving credit facility, a term loan, and a delayed draw term loan. Antares Capital provided the total capital in the form of mezzanine debt, thus, giving it equity options.
What Is Mezzanine Financing?  

Mezzanine financing is a hybrid of debt and equity financing that gives the lender the right to convert the debt to an equity interest in the company in case of default, generally, after venture capital companies and other senior lenders are paid. In terms of risk, it exists between senior debt and equity.



Mezzanine debt has embedded equity instruments. often known as warrants, attached which increase the value of the subordinated debt and allow greater flexibility when dealing with bondholders. Mezzanine financing is frequently associated with acquisitions and buyouts, for which it may be used to prioritize new owners ahead of existing owners in case of bankruptcy.





Key Takeaways

Mezzanine financing is a way for companies to raise funds for specific projects or to aid with an acquisition through a hybrid of debt and equity financing.Mezzanine lending is also used in mezzanine funds which are pooled investments, similar to mutual funds, that offer mezzanine financial to highly qualified businesses. This type of financing can provide more generous returns to investors compared to typical corporate debt, often paying between 12% and 20% a year.Mezzanine loans are most commonly utilized in the expansion of established companies rather than as start-up or early-phase financing. Both mezzanine financing and preferred equity are subject to being called in and replaced by lower interest financing if the market interest rate drops significantly.


   How Mezzanine Financing Works  

Mezzanine financing bridges the gap between debt and equity financing and is one of the highest-risk forms of debt. It is senior to pure equity but subordinate to pure debt. However, this means that it also offers some of the highest returns to investors in debt when compared to other debt types, as it often receives rates between 12% and 20% per year, and sometimes as high as 30%. Mezzanine financing can be considered as very expensive debt or cheaper equity, because mezzanine financing carries a higher interest rate than the senior debt that companies would otherwise obtain through their banks but is substantially less expensive than equity in terms of the overall cost of capital. It is also less diluting of the company's share value. In the end, mezzanine financing permits a business to more more capital and increase its returns on equity.



Companies will turn to mezzanine financing in order to fund specific growth projects or to help with acquisitions having short- to medium-term time horizons. Often, these loans will be funded by the company's long-term investors and existing funders of the company's capital. In that case of preferred equity, there is, in effect, no obligation to repay the money acquired through equity financing. Since there are no mandatory payments to be made, the company has more liquid capital available to it for investing in the business. Even a mezzanine loan requires only interest payments prior to maturity and thus also leaves more free capital in the hands of the business owner.



A number of characteristics are common in the structuring of mezzanine loans, including:



Mezzanine loans are subordinate to senior debt but have priority over both preferred and common stock.
They carry higher yields than ordinary debt.
They are often unsecured debts.
There is no amortization of loan principal.
They may be structured with partially fixed and partially variable interest rates.


   Mezzanine Financing Structure  

Mezzanine financing exists in a company's capital structure between its senior debt and its common stock as either subordinated debt, preferred equity, or some combination of these two. The most common structure for mezzanine financing is unsecured subordinated debt.



Sub-debt, as it is also called, is an unsecured bond or loan that ranks below more senior loans or securities in its ability to claim against the company's assets or earnings. In the case of a borrower default, sub-debt holders are not paid out until all senior debt holders are paid in full. Unsecured sub-debt means that the debt is backed only by the company's promise to pay.



In other words, there is no lien or other credit that supports the debt. Other mezzanine debt is security by a lien on the underlying property and is therefore secured. Payments are usually made with monthly payments of debt service based on a fixed or floating rate and the balance due at the maturity date.



Preferred equity, rather than being a loan that may be unsecured or secured by a lien, is an equity investment in a property-owning entity. It is generally subordinate to mortgage loans and any mezzanine loans but is senior to common equity. It is generally deemed to be a higher risk than mezzanine debt because of increased risk and the lack of collateral.



Payments are made through priority distributions before any distributions to holders of common equity. Some investors negotiate to receive additional profit participation. The principal is repaid at the stated redemption date, usually after that of mezzanine debt. The sponsor may sometimes negotiate for an extension of this date. A preferred equity investor may, however, have broader corporate approval rights because it does not have lender liability issues.


   Maturity, Redemption, and Transferability  

Mezzanine financing typically matures in five years or more. However, the maturity date of any given issue of debt or equity is frequently dependent on the scheduled maturities of existing debt in the issuer's financing structure. Preferred equity generally does not have a fixed maturity date but may be called by the issuer as of some date after its issue. Redemption is usually exercised to take advantage of lower market rates to call in and re-issue debt and equity at lower rates.



Generally, the lender in mezzanine financing has the unrestricted right to transfer its loan. If the loan involves future distributions or advances, the borrower may be able to negotiate a qualified transferee standard as a limitation on the borrower's right to transfer. Preferred equity, in contrast, is often subject to restrictions or conditions on transferring the purchaser's interest in the entity. Once all the preferred equity has been contributed, the entity may permit transfers.


   Advantages and Disadvantages of Mezzanine Financing  

As with any complex financial product or service, mezzanine financing has both advantages and disadvantages to consider for both lenders and borrowers.


  Advantages  

Mezzanine financing may result in lenders—or investors—gaining immediate equity in a business or acquiring warrants for purchasing equity at a later date. This may significantly increase an investor's rate of return (ROR). In addition, mezzanine financing providers are scheduled to receive contractually obligated interest payments made monthly, quarterly, or annually.



Borrowers prefer mezzanine debt because the interest they pay is a tax-deductible business expense, thus substantially reducing the actual cost of the debt. Also, mezzanine financing is more manageable than other debt structures because borrowers may move their interest to the balance of the loan. If a borrower cannot make a scheduled interest payment, some or all of the interest may be deferred. This option is typically unavailable for other types of debt.



In addition, quickly expanding companies grow in value and may restructure mezzanine financing loans into one senior loan at a lower interest rate, saving on interest costs in the long term.



As an investor, the lender often receives an incentive an additional equity interest or option to obtain such interest (a warrant). Sometimes, if the venture is highly successful, the little add-ons can end up hugely valuable. Mezzanine debt also generates a much higher rate of return, important in what is still a low interest rate environment. Mezzanine debit also offers guaranteed periodic payments in contrast to the potential but not guaranteed dividends offered on preferred equity.


  Disadvantages  

When securing mezzanine financing, owners may sacrifice some control and upside potential due to the loss of equity. Lenders may have a long-term perspective and may insist on a board presence. Owners also pay more in interest the longer the mezzanine financing is in place. Loan agreements will also often include restrictive covenants, limiting the ability to borrow additional funds or refinance senior debt, as well as establishing financial ratios the borrower must meet. Restrictions on payouts to key employees and even owners are also not uncommon.



Mezzanine lenders are at risk of losing their investment in the event of the bankruptcy of the borrowing company. In other words, when a company goes out of business, the senior debt holders get paid first by liquidating the company's assets. If there are no assets remaining after the senior debt gets paid off, mezzanine lenders lose out.



Finally, mezzanine loan debt and equity can be tedious and burdensome to negotiate and put into place. Most such deals will take three to six months to finalize the deal.





PROS

Long-term "patient" debt
Cheaper than raising equity
Structural flexibility
No dilutive effect on company's equity
Lenders tend to b long-term



CONS

High interest rates
Debt is subordinated
Can be hard and slow to arrange
May include restrictions on further credit
Owner must relinquish some control





   Example of Mezzanine Financing  

In a mezzanine financing example, Bank XYZ provides Company ABC, a maker of surgical devices, with $15 million in a mezzanine loan financing. The funding replaced a higher interest $10 million credit line with more favorable terms. Company ABC gained more working capital to help bring additional products to the market and paid off a higher interest debt. Bank XYZ will collect 10% a year in interest payments and will be able to convert the debt to an equity stake if the company defaults. Bank XYZ was also able to prohibit Company ABC's borrowing of additional funds and to impose certain financial ratio standards upon it.



In a preferred equity example, company 123 issues Series B 10% Preferred Stock with a par value of $25 and liquidation value of $500. The stock will pay periodic dividends when funds are available until the defined maturity is reached. The relatively high liquidation value is a takeover defense making it unprofitable to acquire the stock for such purposes.



In general, mezzanine loan financing and preferred equity are useful in various situations. Among these are:



Recapitalization of an existing businessLeveraged buyouts to provide financing to the purchasersManagement buyouts, to allow the company's current management to buy out the current owners of the companyGrowth capital for significant capital expenditures or construction of facilities.Financing acquisitionsShareholder buyers, especially attractive to family-owned businesses trying to regain control of shares that may have fallen out of the family's hands to maintain or increase family control of the business.Refinancing of existing debt to pay it off or replace it.Balance sheet restructurings, especially by allowing time for mandatory repayments or no mandatory repayment at all.


   Frequently Asked Questions  
  What Is a Mezzanine Type Loan?  

A mezzanine loan is a source of capital that is between less risky senior debt and higher risk equity with some of the features of both. Mezzanine loans are usually subordinated to senior debt or can be preferred equity with a fixed-rate coupon or divided. They may also have some form of participation rights, such as warrants, in the common equity of the business, though in a manner that will be far less dilutive of ownership than the issuance of common equity.



Mezzanine loans are generally quite expensive (in the 15% to 20% range) but are also "patient" debt in that no payments toward the principal are due prior to maturity. This patient attitude of the debt allows the business to grow toward the ability to repay the loans and to increase its ability to carry more senior and therefore less expensive debt. It is usually not just subordinated but also unsecured.



If the borrower faces liquidity problems, it is possible to push a pause button on current interest payments for mezzanine debt, thus making the senior lenders more secure in their protected senior status.


  What Is Mezzanine Financing in Real Estate?  

A real estate mezzanine loan is generally used to pay for acquisitions or development projects. They are subordinate to senior debt within the entity's capital structure but receive priority over preferred and common equity.



Mezzanine bridge loans cover the cost of a purchase or development project that is not covered by senior debt. The loans are unsecured but may be replaced by equity in the event of a default. Mezzanine financing allows the loan to increase the funding without the ownership dilution that would be caused by the issuance of a significant amount of preferred or common equity.



On the other hand, real estate mezzanine loans appear as equity on the balance sheet, which may make obtaining further financing somewhat easier. For the lender, real estate mezzanine loans offer very high rates of return in a low interest rate environment, the opportunity to obtain some equity or control of the business, and, occasionally, the ability to apply some control to the operations of the business.


  How Do Mezzanine Funds Make Money?  

A mezzanine fund is a pool of capital that seeks to invest in mezzanine finance for the purposes of acquisitions, growth, recapitalization, and management or leveraged buyouts. Investors in a mezzanine fund receive a rate of return of 15 to 20 percent, higher than offered on most forms of debt financing. As with all pooled investments, a mezzanine fund will make money off the interest received on its pooled investments, as well as on profits from purchases and sales of various mezzanine financing instruments.


  Who Provides Mezzanine Financing?  

Mezzanine debt is provided by lenders, usually funds ranging in size from $100 million to more than $5 billion, specializing in such loans. They look to make loans to companies that can safely service higher debt levels.



An ideal debt provider will offer a positive track record of outcomes over the course of many years and will be willing to offer references of previous transactions. The provider should also be willing and able to customize the debt structure to meet a borrower's needs and plans.



Finally, the ideal provider will be willing to work in your interest, providing the best value for the amount, price, and flexibility of the debt raised. Often lenders have previously been involved with the company seeking the loan and each has experience of the other's reliability and ability to understand the business at hand.


  Are Mezzanine Loans Secured?  

Mezzanine debts can be secured on unsecured. Those use in real estate are often indirectly secured to some extent by the borrower's real estate interests. It can be said that in corporate mezzanine financing, the debt is secured by the borrower's ownership interest in the company, but because a mezzanine loan is fairly low down in the repayment schedule. this "collateral" may be of limited value.

   Early Years and Education  

Bloomberg was born on Feb. 14, 1942, in Boston, and grew up in nearby Medford, Massachusetts. He earned an undergraduate degree in electrical engineering from Johns Hopkins University in 1964. He paid his tuition by working as a parking lot attendant and taking out loans. He earned an MBA from Harvard Business School in 1966.



Bloomberg began his career in financial services in 1966 at the now-defunct Wall Street investment bank Salomon Brothers, where his first job was counting bonds and stock certificates in the bank’s vault. He moved up to bond trading, becoming a partner in 1972 and a general partner in 1976.



In 1979, Salomon Brothers moved him from his position of head of equity trading and sales to run Information Systems. This was apparently a demotion, but it put Bloomberg in charge of the department that implemented computer technology. When the company was acquired by the commodity trading firm Phibro in 1981, Bloomberg received a $10 million severance package.


   Bloomberg LP  

Bloomberg used the windfall to found a company called Innovative Market Solutions that used the latest information systems technology to provide traders with data on U.S. Treasury bond prices. Merrill Lynch became a major client and investor in 1982. This company grew into what is today Bloomberg LP, a financial data and media company headquartered in New York City with offices in 100 cities around the world.



Bloomberg LP recorded $11 billion in revenue in 2022. The company operates data terminals used throughout the financial services industry. It also includes the business news cable channel Bloomberg Television, Bloomberg Radio, and a monthly magazine, Bloomberg Markets.



BusinessWeek magazine was purchased by Michael Bloomberg's company in 2009 and was renamed Bloomberg BusinessWeek.






Michael Bloomberg is a strong supporter of gun control and founded the nonprofit Everytown for Gun Safety. During the 2020 election, this group donated millions of dollars for digital advertising to help support candidates who campaigned for stronger gun laws in America.


   Bloomberg's Political Life  

Before entering politics, Bloomberg was a Democrat. He switched to the Republican Party in order to run for mayor of New York City. He won his first term as mayor weeks after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on New York. He won a second term in 2005. After successfully engineering a change in the city's term limits law, he was elected to a third term, this time as an independent candidate, in 2009.



During his time as mayor, Bloomberg focused on improving the city's troubled public school system and revitalizing its former industrial areas. He was among the first American politicians to force limits on smoking, implementing a citywide smoking ban in indoor offices and restaurants. He gained nationwide ridicule from conservatives for attempting to restrict the size of sugary sodas sold in New York City.



Bloomberg was criticized for being out of touch with his everyday constituents and the media reported that the wealth gap in New York City grew during his time as mayor. The Bloomberg administration was also criticized for its "stop and frisk" policy, which many complained unfairly targeted the Black and Latinx populations in the city.


   Bloomberg's Post-Mayoral Politics  

Bloomberg moved to the independent party while still serving as mayor of New York. Politically, he is seen as fiscally conservative but socially liberal, which is a mix is more often seen in New York City than elsewhere.



In the 2016 election, Bloomberg endorsed Democratic Party candidate Hillary Clinton over Republican candidate Donald Trump. He denounced Republicans in Congress as "absolutely feckless" for failing to exercise oversight of President Trump.



In 2018, Bloomberg donated $80 million to Congressional candidates, with all but a fraction of that total going to Democratic or liberal candidates. His goal in making those donations was to help Democrats gain a majority in the House of Representatives. "I've never thought that the public is well-served when one party is entirely out of power, and I think the past year and a half has been evidence of that," Bloomberg stated.



Bloomberg has been an active proponent of gun control. He was one of 15 American mayors who founded an advocacy group, Everytown for Gun Safety, in 2006 to press for reform of gun laws. He has also made substantial donations to environmental organizations and, as mayor of New York, pressed for clean energy policies.


   Presidential Candidate  

On Nov. 24, 2019, Michael Bloomberg entered the 2020 race for the U.S. presidency as a Democrat. He self-funded his campaign and reported to the Federal Election Commission he had spent over $1 billion.



In his campaign statement, Bloomberg aimed at President Trump as his motivation for running. He wrote, "I’m running for president to defeat Donald Trump and rebuild America. We cannot afford four more years of President Trump’s reckless and unethical actions. He represents an existential threat to our country and our values. If he wins another term in office, we may never recover from the damage."



Bloomberg dropped out of the presidential race on March 4, 2020, after a poor showing on Super Tuesday.

Milken served nearly two years in prison for securities fraud but was granted a full pardon by President Trump in 2020.
Michael Milken is banned from working in the securities industry.



   Early Life and Education  

Michael Milken was born on July 4, 1946, in Encino, California. He earned a bachelor's degree from the University of California, Berkeley, and an MBA from the University of Pennsylvania. In 1969, Milken joined Drexel Burnham Lambert as director of low-grade bond research and remained with the company for 17 years.


   Drexel Burnham Lambert  

At Drexel Burnham Lambert, Michael Milken initiated a high-yield bond trading department, an idea that would eventually earn a 100% return on investment. Envisioning a path for investors to garner high returns by buying bonds issued by companies with low credit ratings, Milken helped Drexel Burnham Lambert launch an effort to underwrite junk bonds by convincing companies to issue them.



The bonds provided capital for companies unable to access credit and Milken raised a large amount of money from a sizable base of interested investors. Milken led Drexel Burnham Lambert's lucrative practices of leveraged buy-outs, hostile takeovers, and "junk" bond issues.





Junk Bonds 

Also known as high-yield bonds, they have higher rates of default but offer significantly higher returns. 



In 1987, Michael Milken's compensation topped $550 million and exceeded $1 billion over four years. Milken was nicknamed the "junk bond king" and at its peak, Drexel Burnham Lambert was the fifth-largest investment bank in the U.S.



Wall Street leaders pondered how Drexel Burnham Lambert could allow one executive to gain unregulated power. ''Such an extraordinary income inevitably raises questions as to whether there isn't something unbalanced in the way our financial system is working,'' said David Rockefeller, retired chairman of the Chase Manhattan Bank. ''One has to be concerned when the norms that have been accepted over the years suddenly become so distorted.''


   Indictment  

In 1989, Milken was indicted on racketeering and securities fraud in an insider trading investigation at Drexel Burnham Lambert. On April 24, 1990, Milken pleaded guilty to six felony counts of violating securities laws and was sentenced to ten years in prison. His sentence was later reduced to two years for good behavior and for cooperating with testimony against former colleagues. Michael Milken was also banned life from the securities industry by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).



Drexel Burnham Lambert declared bankruptcy in 1990. Following his release from prison, Michael Milken worked as a strategic consultant which violated his probation, and he was subsequently fined.



Michael Milken was pardoned by President Donald Trump on Feb. 18, 2020, and as of Dec. 26, 2022, Michael Milken's net worth is estimated at $6 billion.




What Is the Milken Family Foundation?
Michael Milken co-founded the nonprofit Milken Family Foundation and the Milken Institute, an economic think tank that hosts conferences around health, politics, media, and culture.




Is Michael Milken an Author?
After being diagnosed with prostate cancer, Michael Milken co-wrote The Taste for Living Cookbook: Mike Milken's Favorite Recipes for Fighting Cancer with Beth Ginsberg.




Has Michael Milken Donated to Education?
In 2014, Michael Milken pledged $10 million to George Washington University to fund public health programs at the Milken Institute School of Public Health.


   The Bottom Line  

Michael Milken is a billionaire and philanthropist known for his investment strategy of high-yield junk bonds as an executive at the Drexel Burnham Lambert. Known as the "junk bond king," Milken served almost two years in prison for securities fraud.
What Is the Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index (MCSI)?  

The Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index (MCSI) is a monthly survey of consumer confidence levels in the United States conducted by the University of Michigan. The survey is based on telephone interviews that gather information on consumer expectations for the economy.



Consumer sentiment is a statistical measurement of the overall health of the economy as determined by consumer opinion. It takes into account people's feelings toward their current financial health, the health of the economy in the short term, and the prospects for longer-term economic growth, and is widely considered to be a useful economic indicator.





Key Takeaways

The Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index (MCSI) is a monthly survey of how consumers feel about the economy, personal finances, business conditions, and buying conditions.The University of Michigan conducts the telephone survey. It releases a preliminary report mid-month and a final report at the end of the month.The MCSI is seen as an important leading economic indicator, as consumer spending accounts for about 68.5% of the U.S. economy.


   Understanding the Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index (MCSI)  

The Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index was created in the 1940s by Professor George Katona at the University of Michigan's Institute for Social Research. His efforts ultimately led to a national telephone survey conducted and published monthly by the university. The survey queries consumers on their views of their own personal finances, as well as the short-term and long-term state of the U.S. economy.



The preliminary report is generally released during the middle of the month and covers survey responses collected in the first two weeks of the month. The final report is released at the end of the month and covers the full month. It is designed to capture the mood of American consumers. Whether the sentiment is optimistic, pessimistic, or neutral, the survey signals information about near-term consumer spending plans.



Because consumer spending accounts for about 68.5% of gross domestic product (GDP) in the U.S., the MCSI is regarded as one of many important economic indicators followed by businesses, policymakers, and participants in the investment community.


   MCSI Basic Design  

Each month, the university conducts a minimum of 500 phone interviews across the continental U.S. The survey asks 50 core questions and covers three areas: personal finances, business conditions, and buying conditions. The answers to these questions form the basis of the index. Consumers are asked questions such as:



Would you say that at the present time business conditions are better or worse than they were a year ago?Would you say that you (and your family living there) are better off or worse off financially than you were a year ago?Do you think that a year from now you (and your family living there) will be better off financially, or worse off, or just about the same as now?What do you think will happen to interest rates for borrowing money during the next 12 months—will they go up, stay the same, or go down?During the next 12 months, do you think that prices, in general, will go up, or go down, or stay where they are now?






About 60% of each monthly survey consists of new responses, and the remaining 40% is drawn from repeat surveys. The repeat surveys help reveal the changes in consumer sentiment over time and provide a more accurate measure of consumer confidence.


   Special Considerations  

According to the University of Michigan, the surveys "have proven to be an accurate indicator of the future course of the national economy." Surveys have demonstrated their ability to accurately anticipate changes in interest rates, unemployment rates, inflation rates, GDP growth, housing, car demand, and other key economic measures.



The Index of Consumer Expectations (ICE) was created as a subsidiary survey of the MCSI. It has come to be included in the larger index of Leading Composite Indicators published by the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) through the Department of Commerce.
What Is a Micro Cap?  

A micro-cap is a publicly-traded company in the U.S. that has a market capitalization between approximately $50 million and $300 million. Micro-cap companies have greater market capitalization than nano caps, and less than small-, mid-, large- and mega-cap corporations. Companies with larger market capitalization do not automatically have stock prices that are higher than those companies with smaller market capitalizations.





Key Takeaways

A micro-cap is a stock with a market cap of between $50 million and $300 million.Micro-cap stocks tend to have greater volatility, thus are inherently riskier, than larger-cap stocks.There is limited information on micro caps, making research extremely important to avoid fraudulent stocks and other potential pitfalls.Another downside to micro caps is limited liquidity, due to the lack of analyst coverage and institutional buyers.


   How a Micro Cap Works  

Companies with less than $50 million in market capitalization are frequently referred to as nano caps. Both nano caps and micro caps are known for their volatility, and as such, tend to be considered riskier than companies with larger market capitalization. Market capitalization measures the market value of a company's outstanding shares, calculated by multiplying the stock's price by the total number of shares outstanding.



Microcaps also have a reputation for high risk because many have unproven products, no solid history, assets, sales, or operations. Lack of liquidity and a small shareholder base also expose them to massive price shocks. 



Being that micro-cap stocks have a market cap between $50 million and $300 million, investors must be ready for greater volatility and risk compared to the large-cap stocks in the S&P 500. However, during periods of bullish strength, micro caps tend to outperform their larger counterparts. For instance, the 10-year returns from 2011–2022 for the Dow Jones Select Micro-Cap Index were an annualized 9.99%, while the S&P 500 Index returned an annualized 11.13%.


   Special Considerations  

While there may be some U.S. micro-cap companies that rely on a heavy portion of their revenue coming from sources outside the U.S., the vast majority conducts all or most of their business within the U.S.



This is important because domestic companies that do not have operations overseas do not need to worry about currency fluctuations and the potential impact of conversion risks on earnings.


   Micro-Cap vs. Larger-Cap  

Another consideration is the fact that there are vastly more micro-cap stocks on the market than there are large- and giant-cap stocks. Overall, investors may not see the same level of readily available information as with larger stocks such as Apple (AAPL).



As a result, the limited information and vast quantity of micro-cap stocks on the market make research extremely important to avoid fraudulent stocks and other potential pitfalls. Because many micro-cap stocks do not have to file regular financial reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), research becomes even more difficult. 


   Criticism of Micro Caps  

Many micro-cap stocks can be found on the over-the-counter (OTC) markets, such as the OTC Bulletin Board (OTCBB) and the OTC Link LLC (OTC Link), rather than national exchanges such as the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). Unlike stocks on national exchanges, companies on these exchanges do not have to meet minimum standards such as for net assets and numbers of shareholders. 



Microcaps also have another drawback in that investors need to pay attention to liquidity when researching smaller companies. Lack of regular analyst coverage and institutional buying are additional reasons why there is less liquidity in the micro-cap markets than in larger-cap stocks.



Overall, micro-cap stocks represent a high-risk, high-reward opportunity for investors who are willing to do more research on the company involved, to determine whether it is worth the investment. This could include contacting the company directly to get the answers to any questions.
What Is a Micromanager?  

A micromanager is a boss or manager who gives excessive supervision to employees. A micromanager, rather than telling an employee what task needs to be accomplished and by when—will watch the employee's actions closely and provide frequent criticism of the employee’s work and processes.





Key Takeaways

A micromanager adopts a corporate management style that focuses on the day-to-day performance of individual teams and workers.While micromanagement may produce some immediate response, it tends to lower company morale and creates a hostile workplace.Once identified, a micromanager can take steps to improve their leadership style and adopt a more macro approach.


   Understanding Micromanagers  

Micromanagement is a form of leadership that may produce results in the short-term, but it hurts employee and company morale over time. Usually, micromanaging has a negative connotation because an employee may feel that a micromanager is being condescending towards them, due to a perceived lack of faith in the employee's competency.



Also, a manager who implements this management style creates an environment where their team develops insecurity and a lack of confidence in its work. In the absence of the manager, the team may find it difficult to function.



A micromanager will usually use up most of their time supervising the work of their direct reports and exaggerating the importance of minor details to subordinates; time that could have been used to get other important things done. Although micromanagement is easily recognized by others in the firm, the micromanager may not view themselves as such.



In contrast to a micromanager, a macro manager is more effective in their management approach. Macro-managing defines broad tasks for direct reports to accomplish and then leaves them alone to do their work. Macro managers have confidence that the team can complete the same task without being continually reminded of the process.


   Signs of Micromanagement  

Signs of micromanagers include but are not limited to:



Asking to be CC’d on every emailOccupying themselves with the work assigned to others, thereby, taking on more work than they can handle because they believe they can do it betterLooking over the team’s shoulders (both literally and figuratively) to monitor what each member is working onConstantly asking for updates on where things standWanting to know what each team member is working on all the timeDelegating not only what needs to be done, but how it should be done, leaving no room for the team to take their own initiativeNever being satisfied with the deliverablesFocusing on details that are not important



From the list provided above, it is easy to understand that a micromanager struggles with meeting deadlines since work has to be redone repeatedly, and valuable time is spent poring over inconsequential details. Team members eventually become frustrated and resentful as their work is undermined at every stage, and they have no autonomy over how to run an assigned project. Because team members' skills and development on the job are stunted, the micromanaging style of leadership is ineffective.


   Ways to Reform a Micromanager  

A micromanager who has identified themselves as such can take a number of steps to break this habit:



Set a couple of metrics that define success for any given project. Ignore every other detail that is not defined.Delegate “what” needs to be done and leave out the “how.”Have an open-door policy for members of the team to use for coaching or further guidance if and when they want it.Set a deadline for each stage of an assigned project, after which a meeting with a reasonable time limit should be conducted to receive updates on the work.
What Is a Micro-Investing Platform?  

A micro-investing platform is an application that allows users to regularly save small sums of money. Micro-investing platforms aim to remove traditional barriers to investing, such as brokerage account minimums, and encourage people to invest even if they have limited incomes and assets.





Key Takeaways

By making investing simple and painless, micro-investing platforms can help people who otherwise wouldn’t accumulate savings for future investment.These platforms take tiny amounts of money, usually from rounding up transactions, and invest them into ETF-based accounts.Small savings can add up over time to yield returns that beat traditional savings vehicles like a savings account of certificates of deposit.


   Understanding Micro-Investing Platforms  

Micro-investing platforms are the digital-age equivalent of saving in a jar all the spare change from your purchases and then taking the full jar of change to the bank. For example, you could sign up for an account with a platform and register your debit card. Each time you make a purchase, the platform rounds up your purchase to the nearest dollar and deposits the difference into an investment account. Robo-advisors, such as Acorns, helped pioneer this concept.



You are unlikely to notice the extra $0.50 missing from your account when you pay $3.50 for a cappuccino. But over time, you will notice the growing sum in your brokerage account. If you buy that same coffee 20 times a month (basically, every workday), you will have effortlessly invested $10 by the end of the month or $120 by the end of the year. Of course, a better solution would be for you to make your own cappuccinos at home for $0.50 and invest the $3.00 savings per cup and end up with an extra $60 a month and $720 a year to invest, but for individuals who don’t want to change their behavior, micro-investing offers a superior alternative to investing nothing at all.



Micro-investing makes investing sums as low as a few pennies possible by eliminating per-transaction fees and investment minimums. Consumers don’t need to save up $100 for one share of a stock or mutual fund, and they don’t need to pay a brokerage fee to purchase that share. Instead, they pay the micro-investing platform a nominal fee, perhaps $1 per month, and it invests their money in fractional shares.



Because those fractional shares are in exchange-traded funds (ETF), the consumer’s investment is diversified across many different stocks and/or bonds, helping to protect against market swings in a way that investing in a single stock does not.



Even for people who save regularly, micro-investing platforms can improve their situation. Saving $50 a month for 10 years in a savings account with 0% interest rate results in $6,000, which actually has less intrinsic value after 10 years since savings accounts usually pay interest at a lower rate than inflation. Investing $49 a month (after the $1 platform fee) for 10 years with an average annual return of 7%, however, results in $8,580 before taxes and inflation.


   Special Considerations  
  Features of Micro-Investing Platforms  

Automatic investment is not a required feature of a micro-investing platform. The ability to invest very small amounts of money is. To that end, some micro-investing platforms aim to help users to not only get in the habit of saving and investing but also to learn about investing. The platform might teach them how to choose an ETF based on their goals, risk tolerance, interests and beliefs, for example.



A notable micro-investing platform is Acorns Inc. which automatically invests a user's spare change through a smartphone app.﻿﻿ Micro-investing platforms must register with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as a Registered Investment Advisor (RIA) and as a broker-dealer.﻿﻿ ﻿﻿
What Is Microcredit?  

Microcredit is a common form of microfinance that involves an extremely small loan given to an individual to help them become self-employed or grow a small business. These borrowers tend to be low-income individuals, especially from less developed countries (LDCs). Microcredit is also known as "microlending" or "microloan."





Key Takeaways

Microcredit is a method of lending very small sums to individuals to start or expand a small business.Microcredit borrowers tend to be low-income individuals living in parts of the developing world; the practice originated in its modern form in Bangladesh.Most microcredit schemes rely on a group borrowing model, originally developed by Nobel Prize winner Muhammad Yunus and his Grameen Bank.


   How Microcredit Works  

The concept of microcredit was built on the idea that skilled people in underdeveloped countries, who live outside of traditional banking and monetary systems could gain entry into an economy through the assistance of a small loan. The people to whom such microcredit is offered may live in barter systems where no actual currency is exchanged.



Modern microcredit is typically attributed to the Grameen Bank model, developed by economist Muhammad Yunus. This system started in Bangladesh in 1976, with a group of women borrowing $27 to finance the group's own small businesses. The women repaid the loan and were able to sustain the business.



The women in Bangladesh who received microcredit did not have money to purchase the materials they needed to make the bamboo stools that they would, in turn, sell—and at the same time, each individual borrower would be too risky to lend to on their own. By borrowing as a group, the initial financing gave them the resources to begin production, with an understanding that the loan would be paid over time as they brought in revenue.






Microloans can range from as small as $10 to $100, and rarely exceed $2,000.



The structure of microcredit arrangements frequently differs from traditional banking, wherein collateral may be required or other terms established to guarantee repayment. There might not be a written agreement at all.



In some instances, the microcredit was guaranteed by an agreement with the members of the borrower’s community, who would be expected to compel the borrower to work toward repaying the debt. As borrowers successfully pay off their microcredits, they may become eligible for loans of larger and larger amounts.


   Micro-Loan Terms  

Like conventional lenders, micro-financiers must charge interest on loans, and they institute specific repayment plans with payments due at regular intervals. Some lenders require loan recipients to set aside a part of their income in a savings account, which can be used as insurance if the customer defaults. If the borrower repays the loan successfully, then they have just accrued extra savings.



Because many applicants cannot offer collateral, microlenders often pool borrowers together as a buffer. After receiving loans, recipients repay their debts together. Because the success of the program depends on everyone's contributions, this creates a form of peer pressure that can help to ensure repayment.



For example, if an individual is having trouble using his or her money to start a business, that person can seek help from other group members or from the loan officer. Through repayment, loan recipients start to develop a good credit history, which allows them to obtain larger loans in the future.



Interestingly, although these borrowers often qualify as very poor, repayment amounts on microloans are often actually higher than the average repayment rate on more conventional forms of financing. For example, the microfinancing institution Opportunity International reported repayment rates of approximately 98.9% in 2016.


   Critiques of Microcredit  

There have been criticisms of microcredit and the way it can be misused. For example, in South Africa, microcredit was introduced in some of the poorest communities to encourage people to pursue self-employment. However, the way it was introduced, in some instances, led to the funds being expended through consumption spending, rather than the establishment or furthering of any form of business or employment activity.



Also, the borrowers may find themselves with a magnitude of debt they cannot repay, even with the small-scale loans offered through microcredit. The problem is that the borrowers may not have a steady income source, or they plan to use the microcredit to create an income source for themselves that would allow them to pay back the financing. As a result, some borrowers have resorted to selling off personal property and seeking new financing to cover their previous microcredit.
What Is Microeconomics?  

Microeconomics is the social science that studies the implications of incentives and decisions, specifically how those affect the utilization and distribution of resources. Microeconomics shows how and why different goods have different values, how individuals and businesses conduct and benefit from efficient production and exchange, and how individuals best coordinate and cooperate with one another. Generally speaking, microeconomics provides a more complete and detailed understanding than macroeconomics.

Key Takeaways

Microeconomics studies the decisions of individuals and firms to allocate resources of production, exchange, and consumption.Microeconomics deals with prices and production in single markets and the interaction between different markets but leaves the study of economy-wide aggregates to macroeconomics.Microeconomists formulate various types of models based on logic and observed human behavior and test the models against real-world observations.


   Understanding Microeconomics  

Microeconomics is the study of what is likely to happen (tendencies) when individuals make choices in response to changes in incentives, prices, resources, and/or methods of production. Individual actors are often grouped into microeconomic subgroups, such as buyers, sellers, and business owners. These groups create the supply and demand for resources, using money and interest rates as a pricing mechanism for coordination.


   The Uses of Microeconomics  

Microeconomics can be applied in a positive or normative sense. Positive microeconomics describes economic behavior and explains what to expect if certain conditions change. If a manufacturer raises the prices of cars, positive microeconomics says consumers will tend to buy fewer than before. If a major copper mine collapses in South America, the price of copper will tend to increase, because supply is restricted. Positive microeconomics could help an investor see why Apple Inc. stock prices might fall if consumers buy fewer iPhones. Microeconomics could also explain why a higher minimum wage might force The Wendy's Company to hire fewer workers.



These explanations, conclusions, and predictions of positive microeconomics can then also be applied normatively to prescribe what people, businesses, and governments should do in order to attain the most valuable or beneficial patterns of production, exchange, and consumption among market participants. This extension of the implications of microeconomics from what is to what ought to be or what people ought to do also requires at least the implicit application of some sort of ethical or moral theory or principles, which usually means some form of utilitarianism.


   Method of Microeconomics  

Microeconomic study historically has been performed according to general equilibrium theory, developed by Léon Walras in Elements of Pure Economics (1874) and partial equilibrium theory, introduced by Alfred Marshall in Principles of Economics (1890). The Marshallian and Walrasian methods fall under the larger umbrella of neoclassical microeconomics. Neoclassical economics focuses on how consumers and producers make rational choices to maximize their economic well being, subject to the constraints of how much income and resources they have available. Neoclassical economists make simplifying assumptions about markets—such as perfect knowledge, infinite numbers of buyers and sellers, homogeneous goods, or static variable relationships—in order to construct mathematical models of economic behavior.



These methods attempt to represent human behavior in functional mathematical language, which allows economists to develop mathematically testable models of individual markets. Neoclassicals believe in constructing measurable hypotheses about economic events, then using empirical evidence to see which hypotheses work best. In this way, they follow in the “logical positivism” or “logical empiricism” branch of philosophy. Microeconomics applies a range of research methods, depending on the question being studied and the behaviors involved.


   Basic Concepts of Microeconomics  

The study of microeconomics involves several key concepts, including (but not limited to):



Incentives and behaviors: How people, as individuals or in firms, react to the situations with which they are confronted.Utility theory: Consumers will choose to purchase and consume a combination of goods that will maximize their happiness or “utility,” subject to the constraint of how much income they have available to spend.Production theory: This is the study of production—or the process of converting inputs into outputs. Producers seek to choose the combination of inputs and methods of combining them that will minimize cost in order to maximize their profits.Price theory: Utility and production theory interact to produce the theory of supply and demand, which determine prices in a competitive market. In a perfectly competitive market, it concludes that the price demanded by consumers is the same supplied by producers. That results in economic equilibrium.
What Is Microfinance?  

Microfinance, also called microcredit​, is a type of banking service provided to low-income individuals or groups who otherwise wouldn't have access to financial services.



While institutions participating in microfinance most often provide lending—microloans can range from as small as $50 to under $50,000. But many banks offer additional services such as checking and savings accounts as well as micro-insurance products, and some even offer financial and business education. The goal of microfinance is to ultimately give impoverished people an opportunity to become self-sufficient.





Key Takeaways

Microfinance is a banking service provided to low-income individuals or groups who otherwise would have no other access to financial services. Microfinance allows people to take on reasonable small business loans safely, in a manner that is consistent with ethical lending practices.  The majority of microfinancing operations occur in developing nations, such as Bangladesh, Cambodia, India, Afghanistan, Democratic Republic of Congo, Indonesia, and Ecuador, among others.Like conventional lenders, microfinanciers charge interest on loans and institute specific repayment plans.The global microfinance market was valued at an estimated $187 billion in 2022, and is expected to exceed $488 billion by 2030.

   Understanding Microfinance  

Microfinance services are provided to unemployed or low-income individuals because most people trapped in poverty, or who have limited financial resources, don't have enough income to do business with traditional financial institutions.



Despite being excluded from banking services, however, people who live on as little as $2 a day do attempt to save, borrow, or acquire credit or insurance, and they do make payments on their debt. Thus, many poor people typically look to family, friends, and even loan sharks (who often charge exorbitant interest rates) for help.



Microfinance allows people to take on reasonable small business loans safely, and in a manner that is consistent with ethical lending practices. Although they exist all around the world, the majority of microfinancing operations occur in developing nations, such as Bangladesh, Cambodia, India, Afghanistan, Democratic Republic of Congo, Indonesia, and Ecuador. Many microfinance institutions, sometimes referred to as MFIs, focus on helping women in particular.



Microfinancing organizations support a large number of activities, ranging from providing the basics—like bank checking and savings accounts—to startup capital for small business entrepreneurs and educational programs that teach the principles of investing. These programs can focus on such skills as bookkeeping, cash-flow management, and technical or professional skills, like accounting.






Unlike typical financing situations, in which the lender is primarily concerned with the borrower having enough collateral to cover the loan, many microfinance organizations focus on helping entrepreneurs succeed.



In many instances, people seeking help from microfinance organizations are first required to take a basic money-management class. Lessons cover understanding interest rates, the concept of cash flow, how financing agreements and savings accounts work, how to budget, and how to manage debt.



Once educated, customers may apply for loans. Just as one would find at a traditional bank, a loan officer helps borrowers with applications, oversees the lending process, and approves loans. The typical loan, sometimes as little as $100, may not seem like much to some people in the developed world, but for many impoverished people, this figure often is enough to start or sustain a business or engage in other profitable activities.


   Microfinance Loan Terms  

Like conventional lenders, microfinanciers must charge interest on loans, and they institute specific repayment plans with payments due at regular intervals. Some lenders require loan recipients to set aside a part of their income in a savings account, which can be used as insurance if the customer defaults. If the borrower repays the loan successfully, then they have just accrued extra savings. 






Empowering women in particular, as many microfinance organizations do, may lead to more stability and prosperity for families.



Because many applicants can't offer collateral, microlenders often pool borrowers together as a buffer. After receiving loans, recipients repay their debts together. Because the success of the program depends on everyone's contributions, this creates a form of peer pressure that can help to ensure repayment.



For example, if an individual is having trouble using their money to start a business, that person can seek help from other group members or from the loan officer. Through repayment, loan recipients start to develop a good credit history, which allows them to get larger loans in the future.



Although these borrowers often qualify as "very poor," repayment rates on microloans are often higher than the average repayment rate on more conventional forms of financing. For example, the Grameen Bank in Bangladesh, one of the original microlenders, reports an average repayment rate of 98%.


   History of Microfinance  

Microfinance isn't a new concept. Small operations of this type have existed since the 18th century. The first occurrence of microlending is attributed to the Irish Loan Fund system, introduced by Jonathan Swift, which sought to improve conditions for impoverished Irish citizens. In its modern form, microfinancing became popular on a large scale in the 1970s.



The first organization to receive attention was the Grameen Bank, started in 1983 by Muhammad Yunus in Bangladesh. In addition to providing loans to its clients, the Grameen Bank also suggests that its customers subscribe to its "16 Decisions," a basic list of ways that the poor can improve their lives. The 16 Decisions touch upon a wide variety of subjects, ranging from a request to stop the practice of issuing dowries upon a couple's marriage, to keeping drinking water sanitary. In 2006, the Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to both Yunus and the Grameen Bank for their efforts in developing the microfinance system.



There are other microfinance operations around the world. Some larger organizations work closely with the World Bank, while other smaller groups operate in different nations. Some organizations enable lenders to choose exactly who they want to support, categorizing borrowers with criteria such as level of poverty, geographic region, and type of small business.


   Benefits of Microfinance  

Millions of people have directly or indirectly benefited from microfinance-related operations. The Consultative Group to Assist the Poor, a Washington-based global nonprofit organization, estimates that, as of 2021, more than 120 million people had directly benefited from microfinance-related operations. However, these operations are only available to some of the world's poor, while an estimated 1.7 billion people lack access to establishing basic financial accounts.






The benefits of microfinance extend beyond the direct effects of giving people a source for capital. Entrepreneurs who create successful businesses, in turn, create jobs, trade, and overall economic improvement within a community.


   The For-Profit Controversy  

Although there are countless heartwarming success stories, microfinance has sometimes been the target of criticism. As microfinance interest rates are generally higher than conventional banks', critics have charged that these operations are making money off the poor.



In fact, some non-profit microlenders have converted to being for-profit as they've grown. One of the largest, and most controversial, is Mexico's Banco Compartamos. The bank was started in 1990 as a nonprofit. However, 10 years later, management decided to transform the enterprise into a traditional, for-profit company. In 2007, it went public on the Mexican Stock Exchange, and its initial public offering (IPO) raised more than $400 million.



Like most other microfinance companies, Compartamos Banco makes relatively small loans, serves a largely female clientele, and pools borrowers into groups. The main difference lies in how it uses the funds it nets in interest and repayments. Like any public company, it distributes them to shareholders. In contrast, nonprofit institutions take a more philanthropic stance toward profits, using them to expand the number of people they help or to create more programs. 


  Concerns About For-Profit Microfinancing  

In addition to Compartamos Banco, many major financial institutions and other large corporations have launched for-profit microfinance departments, including Citigroup and Barclays, for example. Other companies have created mutual funds that invest primarily in microfinance firms.



Compartamos Banco and its for-profit peers have been criticized by many, including the grandfather of modern microfinance himself, Yunus. The immediate, pragmatic fear is that, out of a desire to make money, large microfinance bankers will charge higher interest rates that may create a debt trap for low-income borrowers.



But Yunus and others also have a more fundamental concern: that the incentive for microcredit should be poverty alleviation, not profit. By their very nature—and their obligation to stockholders—these publicly traded firms work against the original mission of microfinance: helping the poor above all else.



In response, Compartamos and other for-profit microfinanciers counter that commercialization allows them to operate more efficiently, and to attract more capital by appealing to profit-seeking investors. By becoming a profitable business, their argument goes, a microfinance bank is able to extend its reach, providing more money and more loans to low-income applicants. For now, though, charitable and commercialized microfinanciers do co-exist.


  Other Criticisms of Microfinance  

In addition to the divide between the nonprofit and for-profit microfinance enterprises, other criticisms exist. Some say that individual microloans of $100 aren't enough money to provide independence—rather, they keep recipients working in subsistence-level trades, or just cover basic needs, like food and shelter.



A better approach, these critics maintain, is to create jobs by constructing new factories and producing new goods. They cite the examples of China and India, where the development of large industries has led to stable employment and higher wages, which in turn has helped millions to emerge from the lowest levels of poverty.



Other critics have said that the presence of interest payments is a burden. Despite the healthy repayment rates, there still are borrowers who can't, or don't, repay loans, because of the failure of their ventures, personal catastrophe, or other reasons. So, this added debt can make recipients of microcredit even poorer than when they started.




What Are the General Terms of a Microfinance Loan?
Like conventional lenders, microfinanciers must charge interest on loans, and they institute specific repayment plans with payments due at regular intervals. Some lenders require loan recipients to set aside a part of their income in a savings account, which can be used as insurance if the customer defaults. If the borrower repays the loan successfully, then they have gained accrued extra savings. 




What Are the Benefits of Microfinance?
The benefits of microfinance extend beyond the direct effects of giving people a source for capital. Entrepreneurs who create successful businesses can then offer jobs and trade to help improve their community. Additionally, the International Finance Corp. (IFC) has helped establish or improve credit reporting bureaus in 30 developing nations. It also has advocated for adding relevant laws that govern financial activities in developing countries.




What Are Some Criticisms of Microfinance?
While some microfinance interest rates are lower than conventional banks' rates, critics have charged that these operations are making money off the poor. Also, many major financial institutions and other large corporations have launched for-profit microfinance departments, raising concerns that, out of a desire to make money, these larger bankers will charge higher interest rates that may create a debt trap for low-income borrowers. And some have argued that individual microloans aren't enough money to provide a realistic path to independence.


   The Bottom Line  

Microfinance is a form of banking service provided to low-income individuals or groups who otherwise wouldn't have access to financial services. Institutions most often lend amounts of $50 to under $50,000, but they may also offer checking and savings accounts, and some deliver financial and business education. The goal of microfinance is to ultimately give impoverished people an opportunity to become self-sufficient.



Some criticisms of the microlending industry as it's grown include excessively high interest rates charged on the small loans extended, profit motives at odds with the original intent of helping the poor, and loans so limited they can't really make their impoverished borrowers self-sufficient.
What Is Micromarketing?  

Micromarketing is an approach to advertising that tends to target a specific group of people in a niche market. With micromarketing, products or services are marketed directly to a targeted group of customers.



To make use of micromarketing techniques, a company has to narrowly define an audience by a particular characteristic, such as gender, job title, age, or geography, and then create campaigns geared toward that specific group. It can be a more expensive technique than other approaches to marketing due to customization and lack of an economy of scale.





Key Takeaways

Micromarketing is an advertising strategy that allows a corporation to target a niche group with a particular product or service.With micromarketing, a company defines an audience by a specific trait, such as gender or job title or age range, and then creates campaigns geared toward that specific group.A company's ultimate goal in micromarketing is to communicate to a targeted group of consumers and get them to take action, such as buying a good or service.


   Understanding Micromarketing  

Marketing is crucial for businesses operating in a competitive environment. As a strategy, marketing is used by companies to increase their sales, customer base, brand awareness, and ultimately, profits.



The long-term strength of any business depends upon how successful its marketing campaign is. Whether a company offers one or 101 products, it must identify its target market in order to run an effective marketing campaign. In the past, companies ran mass marketing campaigns through TV or radio ads in the hopes of catching the attention of consumers in target markets. Today, businesses are able to offer more personalized marketing schemes to each individual in their target pool, as opposed to hitting a mass audience at once.



Micromarketing became more common in the 1990s, as the personal computer boom meant easier segmentation and dissemination of information to customers. With technology constantly advancing, the delivery of highly-customized products to individual segments of a population has become easier to deliver. Micromarketing strategy is useful for firms of any size. Large firms can create specific segments within their customer base, while small businesses with smaller advertising budgets prefer to match consumers with targeted products and promotions by personalizing their marketing process. 


   How Micromarketing Works  

There are different approaches to micromarketing. For example, a business may decide to run a micromarketing program by offering promotions specifically to its loyal customer base; matching special offers to unhappy or lost consumers; tailoring products to consumers with unique needs; marketing goods and services to residents in a particular town or region; or offering products to targeted consumers with specific job titles or career designations.



The challenge with micromarketing is its high cost of implementation and lack of an economy of scale. Companies using this marketing strategy typically spend more per target consumer, and customizing many advertisements to appeal to many small groups of consumers is more expensive than creating a few marketing ads targeted at a mass audience. Also, micromarketing can be expensive to run due to the inability to scale up in size.



Micromarketing is different from macromarketing, a strategy that looks to target the biggest possible consumer base of a company product or service. With macromarketing, a business attempts to measure how wide a scale its target market for a good or service is, and proceeds to work on how its products can be made available to this group of consumers.


   Example of Micromarketing  

Examples of companies that have run successful micromarketing campaigns include Procter & Gamble (PG) and Uber.



When P&G was introducing its Pantene Relaxed & Natural shampoo and conditioner product line, it created and ran a unique marketing campaign to target African American women. When Uber was trying to expand its geographic reach, it used big data from social media platforms to learn more about the specific transportation problems in each city it was looking to move into. The resulting effect was the growth of the company’s client base through tailored promotions and referral benefits.


   Special Considerations  

The expansion in emergent innovation, including big data, is used by micromarketers to capture data from mobile devices and e-commerce platforms. The captured data is sorted according to various distinctions, including demographics, geographies (IP address), favored sites, brand preferences, or spending habits, to track the type of products that a consumer is viewing or purchases. This process allows a website to match related products to digital consumers.



By running a tailored marketing program to a well-defined segment of consumers, micromarketing looks to entice the target audience to take an action, such as making a purchase of goods or services. The ultimate goal of micromarketing is to match products to a consumer’s tracked preferences in order to generate profit for a company from customer satisfaction.
What Is Mid-Cap?  

Mid-cap (or mid-capitalization) is the term that is used to designate companies with a market cap (capitalization)—or market value—between $2 and $10 billion. As the name implies, a mid-cap company falls in the middle between large-cap (or big-cap) and small-cap companies. Classifications, such as large-cap, mid-cap, and small-cap are approximations of a company's current value; as such, they may change over time.





Key Takeaways


Mid-cap is the term given to companies with a market cap (capitalization)—or market value—between $2 billion and $10 billion.
For companies, some of the appealing features of mid-cap companies are that they are expected to grow and increase profits, market share. and productivity; they are in the middle of their growth curve.
Mid-cap stocks are useful in portfolio diversification because they provide a balance of growth and stability.



   Understanding Mid-Cap  

There are two main ways a company can raise capital when it's needed: through debt or equity. Debt must be paid back but can generally be borrowed at a lower rate than equity (due to tax advantages). Equity may cost more, but it does not need to be paid back in times of crisis. As a result, companies strive to strike a balance between debt and equity. This balance is referred to as a firm's capital structure. Capital structure, especially equity capital structure, can tell investors a lot about the growth prospects for a company.



One way to gain insight about a company's capital structure and market depth is by calculating its market capitalization. Companies with low market capitalization, also referred to as small-caps, have $2 billion or less in market capitalization. Large-capitalization firms have over $10 billion in market capitalization, and mid-cap firms fall somewhere in between these two categories (ranging from $2 billion to $10 billion in market capitalization). Additional categories such as mega-cap (over $200 billion), micro-cap ($50 million to $500 million) and nano-cap (less than $50 million) have been added to the spectrum of market capitalization for the sake of clarity.



For investors, a mid-cap company may be appealing because they are expected to grow and increase in profits, market share, and productivity; they are in the middle of their growth curve. Since they are still considered to be in a growth stage, they are deemed to be less risky than small-caps, but more risky than large-caps. Successful mid-cap companies run the risk of seeing their market capitalization rise, mainly due to an increase in their share prices, to the point where they fall out of the 'mid-cap' category.



While a company's market cap depends on market price, a company with a stock priced above $10 is not necessarily a mid-cap stock. To calculate market capitalization, analysts multiply the current market price by the current number of shares outstanding. For example, if company A has 10 billion shares outstanding at a price of $1, it has a market capitalization of $10 billion. If company B has one billion shares outstanding at a price of $5, company B has a market capitalization of $5 billion. Even though company A has a lower stock price, it has a higher market capitalization than company B. Company B may have the higher stock price, but it has one-tenth of the shares outstanding.


   Advantages of Mid-Caps  

Most financial advisors suggest that the key to minimizing risk is a well-diversified portfolio; investors should have a mix of small-, mid- and large-cap stocks. However, some investors see mid-cap stocks as a way to diversify risk, as well. Small-cap stocks offer the most growth potential, but that growth comes with the most risk. Large-cap stocks offer the most stability, but they offer lower growth prospects. Mid-cap stocks represent a hybrid of the two, providing a balance of growth and stability.



No one can accurately predict when the market will favor a specific kind of company, whether it’s a large-, mid- or small-cap. So it’s important to diversify your portfolio, as we mentioned above. But the percentage of mid-caps that you’ll want to invest in depends on your specific goals and risk tolerance.



However, there are many advantages to mid-cap companies that investors may want to consider. When interest rates are low and capital is cheap, corporate growth is generally stable. Mid-cap companies typically can get the credit they need in order to grow, and they do well during the expansion part of the business cycle.



Mid-caps are not as risky as small-cap companies, which means they tend to do relatively well financially during times of economic turbulence. In addition, many mid-caps are well known, are often focused on one specific business, and have been around long enough to make a niche in their target market. And finally, because they are riskier than large caps, they may have a higher return, which could be more appealing to a less risk averse investor's bottom line. 



Investor's can either buy a mid-cap company's stock directly or buy a mid-cap mutual fund—an investment vehicle that focuses on mid-cap companies.
What Is a Midcap Fund?  

A mid-cap fund is a pooled investment vehicle (e.g. a mutual fund or ETF) that explicitly invests in the stocks of mid-cap companies, or companies with market capitalizations ranging from approximately $2 billion to $10 billion.





Key Takeaways

A mid-cap fund is a pooled investment, such as a mutual fund, that focuses on companies with a market capitalization in the middle range of listed stocks.Mid-cap stocks tend to offer investors greater growth potential than large cap stocks, but with less volatility and risk than small cap stocks.Mid-cap funds allow investors to easily and cost-effectively hold a diversified portfolio of these types of stocks.There are several benchmark indexes that mid-cap funds can track, such as the S&P 400 and Russell 1000.


   Understanding Mid-Cap Funds  

Mid-cap funds provide a diversified portfolio of mid-cap companies for investors. Mid-cap stock funds invest in firms with established businesses. Therefore, these companies have made equity capital markets a substantial part of their capital structures. Overall, mid-cap companies tend to offer more growth potential than large-cap stocks and with less volatility than the small-cap segment. Mid-cap funds seek to capitalize on this capital appreciation potential by creating funds that are diversified among mid-cap companies.



Many fund companies and indexes focus on mid-cap stocks with an additional component such as growth or value. Mid-cap funds can be actively managed or passively managed. The mid-cap segment of the market offers a wide range of investment options for investors. Some of the mid-cap segment's most popular benchmarks are the S&P MidCap 400, the Russell 1000 MidCap Index, and the Wilshire US Mid-Cap Index. As of December 2020, the smallest member of the Wilshire US Mid-Cap Index was valued at $0.8 billion. The largest had a market capitalization of $23.4 billion.


   Defining Midcap  

"Mid-cap" is the term given to companies with a market capitalization (or value) between $2 billion and $10 billion. As the name implies, a mid-cap company falls in the middle between large-cap (or big-cap) and small-cap companies. Classifications such as large-cap, mid-cap, and small-cap are only approximations and may change over time.



Most financial advisors suggest that the key to minimizing risk is a diversified portfolio; investors should have a mix of small-cap, mid-cap, and large-cap stocks. However, some investors see mid-cap stocks as a way to diversify risk as well. Small-cap stocks offer the most growth potential, but that growth comes with the most risk. Large-cap stocks offer the most stability, but they offer lower growth prospects. Mid-cap stocks are a hybrid of the two, providing both growth and stability.


   Benefits of Mid-Cap Funds  

Mid-cap funds have some advantages over both individual mid-cap stocks and other fund types. While less volatile than small-cap stocks, holding only a few mid-cap funds is usually much riskier than holding several large-cap stocks. By investing in a mid-cap fund, investors can capture the growth potential of mid-cap funds without company-specific risks.



Mid-cap funds can follow a somewhat different pattern than either large or small stocks. Because of this they are useful for portfolio diversification. Historically, there have been long periods when either large or small stocks outperformed. Choosing a mid-cap fund can prevent investors from going too far in the wrong direction.


   Criticism of Mid-Cap Funds  

By investing in a mid-cap fund rather than holding individual mid-cap stocks, investors can miss out on massive gains. In particular, the CAN SLIM system developed by William J. O'Neil is often applied successfully to mid-cap stocks. The idea is that winning stocks can be spotted on their way up through the small caps. By the time stocks reach the mid-cap funds, the speculators are ready to profit. For example, O'Neil flagged Netflix (NFLX) as a top pick in 2009. However, most investors are less successful at picking winners.


   Examples of Mid-Cap Funds  

Here are some examples of the market’s top mid-cap funds.


  BlackRock MidCap Growth Equity Fund (BMGAX)  

The BlackRock MidCap Growth Equity Fund is an actively managed mutual fund. It seeks to invest in mid-cap companies from the Russell MidCap Growth Index that it believes have superior growth characteristics. As of June 16, 2021, it had a year-to-date net asset value (NAV) return of 4.99%. The fund is benchmarked to the Russell MidCap Growth Index, which had a YTD NAV return of 5.30% as of June 16, 2021. The fund had a gross expense ratio of 1.14% and a net expense ratio of 1.05% for A-shares.


  Vanguard Mid-Cap ETF (VO)  

The Vanguard Mid-Cap ETF is one of the largest passive index funds in the mid-cap market segment. The fund uses an index replication strategy to track the holdings and performance of the CRSP U.S. Mid Cap Index. As of June 17, 2021, the fund has a year to date NAV return of 13.73%. The fund has an expense ratio of 0.04%.
What Is MENA?  

MENA is an acronym for the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region. The region is typically considered to include around 19 countries, but the definition can be stretched to include up to 27. The World Bank includes 21 countries as part of MENA and based on their 2020 population reports, the region accounts for approximately 6% of the world's population.



According to OPEC data, the MENA region holds more than half of the world's oil reserves, and two-fifths of the world's natural gas reserves. Due to the region's substantial petroleum and natural gas production, MENA is an important source of global economic and energy resources.





Key Takeaways

The Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region includes approximately 21 countries, according to The World Bank.The region has vast oil, petroleum, and natural gas reserves.Due to these reserves, MENA is an important source of global economic resources.The region is nonetheless afflicted by persistent conflicts in Syria, Iraq, Iran, Libya, and Yemen.With the United States and Russia each supporting opposing sides and providing military resources, the region remains a proxy for global economic power.


   Understanding MENA  

Many of the 13 OPEC nations are within the MENA region. While there is no standardized list of countries included in the MENA region, the term typically includes the area from Morocco in northwest Africa to Iran in southwest Asia and down to Sudan in Africa.



The following countries are often included in the MENA region (not an exhaustive list): Algeria, Bahrain, Djibouti, Egypt, Iran, Iraq, Israel, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Libya, Malta, Morocco, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Tunisia, United Arab Emirates, Palestine, and Yemen.






Facing a tough recovery due to COVID-19, economic growth in the MENA region fell by 3.8% in 2020 according to the World Bank.


   Some Key MENA Economies  
  Kingdom of Saudi Arabia  

By far the largest economy in the MENA region, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia reported a Gross Domestic Product of $833 billion in 2021. The country is highly dependent on petroleum and natural gas, which provide some 90% of the country's export earnings.



Although it controls the world's second-largest proven oil reserves, Saudi Arabia has announced efforts to reduce its dependence on petroleum exports through investments in the technology and tourism sectors.


  Islamic Republic of Iran  

Iran is the fifth-largest economy in the MENA region. Like Saudi Arabia, petroleum exports play a major role in the country's economy, though it is more diversified than many other oil exporters in the Middle East.



However, Iran is also subject to strict international economic sanctions as a state-sponsor of terrorism, a growing nuclear threat, and perpetrator of cyber intrusions against foreign countries. As a result, it is difficult for Iran's economy to boom. Iran's currency has greatly weakened and sanctions greatly restrict international trade.


  State of Israel  

With a GDP of $488 billion in 2021, Israel is the second-largest economy in the MENA region, behind the geographically much larger Saudi Arabia. Unlike many of its neighbors, Israel is not an energy exporter; instead, the economy is largely centered around industrial manufacturing, diamond cutting, and high technology. In fact, Israel is ranked among the top-10 of global high-tech ecosystems. Israel has become world renowned as being the “start-up nation” and is the world leader for number of start-ups per capita.



Although it is a comparatively advanced industrial country with high average incomes and a strong currency, Israel's position has often been complicated by geopolitical conflicts with its neighbors.


  Egypt  

With a 2020 GDP of $365 billion, Egypt represents the largest economy in North Africa as well as the third-largest economy in the MENA region. Following the overthrow of President Hosni Mubarak during the 2011 Arab Spring protests, the Egyptian economy began to undergo significant market reforms, ​which helped attract outside investors and address domestic unemployment. In addition to hydrocarbons, Egypt is a major exporter of textiles and agricultural products.

   Investing in the MENA Region  

With more than half of the world's proven oil reserves, most investment opportunities in the MENA region are focused on the energy industries. There are many financial products allowing both retail and institutional investors to gain exposure to specific countries' oil and natural gas markets, as well as ETFs that target North Africa, the Middle East, or the MENA region as a whole.



Several MENA economies are deliberately re-orienting their economies to reduce their dependence on fossil fuel exports. For example, the United Arab Emirates has a burgeoning tech sector, and Qatar is expanding into financial services.



There are currently no MENA-specific ETFs in the U.S. that encompass the entire region. Instead, there are several sub-regional or country-specific ETFs that American investors can access. These include:

Fast Fact

There is no specific boundary for the Middle East, North Africa, or the MENA region as a whole. Borderline cases like Turkey, Afghanistan, and Sudan may or may not be included in the MENA region.


   Conflict in the MENA Region  

Due to the strategic importance of their oil reserves, countries in the MENA region have been affected by major local conflicts as well as interference by foreign powers.



Notably, the U.S. invasions of Iraq and Afghanistan caused major disruptions in regional economic activity, while the 2011 Arab Spring protests caused a number of revolutions and civil wars, most notably in Libya and Syria, as well as what the World Bank described as "the biggest refugee crisis since World War II." Other conflicts in the area include Israeli clashes with Palestinian terrorists, ongoing wars in Syria, Yemen, Iraq, and Afghanistan, political instability in Lebanon, and a growing rivalry between Iran and Saudi Arabia as regional power.




What Does MENA Stand for?
MENA stands for the Middle East and Northern Africa, referring to the countries between Iran in the East and Tunisia and Morocco in the West.




What Countries Are in the MENA Region?
There is no clear definition of which countries are included in the MENA Region, but it is typically considered to include at least Algeria, Bahrain, Djibouti, Egypt, Iran, Iraq, Israel, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Libya, Malta, Morocco, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Tunisia, the United Arab Emirates, Palestine, and Yemen. Also sometimes included are Mauritania, Somalia, Sudan, Turkey, and Western Sahara, to name a few.




What Are the Countries in the Middle East?
The Middle East is generally considered to include the countries on or near the Arabian Peninsula. According to the CIA World Factbook, the Middle East includes Armenia, Azerbaijan, Bahrain, Gaza Strip/Westbank, Georgia, Iran, Iraq, Israel, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Syria, Turkey, United Arab Emirates, and Yemen. Afghanistan and Pakistan are often grouped together with the Middle East, but they are not typically included in considerations of the MENA region.




Which Countries Make up North Africa?
The countries of Northern Africa typically include Algeria, Egypt, Libya, Morocco, Sudan, Tunisia, and Western Sahara. This term may also be extended to include certain East African countries such as Djibouti and Somalia.


   The Bottom Line  

The Middles East and North African region, better known by the acronym MENA, is an important energy resource-rich region of the world. Centrally located between the West and Asia, MENA countries are home to much of the world's oil and natural gas reserves. As emerging markets, investors look to these countries as growth opportunities; however, the risk of regional conflict remains high.
What Is a Middle-Income Country? (MIC)  

According to the World Bank, middle-income countries (MICs) are defined as economies with a gross national income (GNI) per capita between $1,136 and $13,845 as of 2024. MICs consist of lower-middle-income countries and upper-middle-income countries, both of which are part of the income categories that the World Bank uses to classify economies for operational and analytical purposes.





Key Takeaways

Middle-income countries are those with $1,136 and $13,845 in per capita GNI. The World Bank classifies countries for operational purposes for the financial and economic development services that it provides to them.Middle-income countries make up a large share of the world's population and economic activity, and they are key to global economic growth.


   Understanding Middle-Income Countries (MICs)  

The World Bank has historically classified every economy as low-, middle-, or high-income. It now further specifies countries as having low-, lower-middle-, upper-middle-, or high-income economies. The World Bank uses GNI per capita, in current U.S. dollars converted by the Atlas method of a three-year moving average of exchange rates, as the basis for this classification.



It views GNI as a broad measure and the single best indicator of economic capacity and progress. The World Bank used to refer to low-income and middle-income economies as developing economies; in 2016, it chose to drop the term from its vocabulary, citing a lack of specificity. Instead, the World Bank now refers to countries by their region, income, and lending status.


   MIC Characteristics  

MICs are broken up into lower-middle-income and upper-middle-income economies. Lower-middle-income economies have per capita GNIs between $1,136 and $4,465, while upper-middle economies have per capita GNIs between $4,466 and $13,845.



MICs are a very diverse group by region, size, population, and income level, ranging from tiny nations with small populations, such as Belize and the Marshall Islands, to all five of the BRICS countries—Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa. China and India together account for approximately one-third of the world's population and are increasingly influential players in the global economy.



The diverse nature of MICs means that the challenges facing many of them are quite different. For nations in the lower-middle-income category, the biggest issue might be providing their citizens with essential services, such as water and electricity. For the economies in the upper-middle-income category, the greatest challenges could be curbing corruption and improving governance.


   The Significance of MICs  

MICs are essential for continued global economic growth and stability. According to the World Bank, sustainable growth and development in MICs have positive spillovers to the rest of the world. Examples are poverty reduction, international financial stability, and global cross-border issues, including climate change, sustainable energy development, food and water security, and international trade.



MICs have a combined population of five billion, or over 75% of the world's seven billion people, hosting 62% of the world's economically disadvantaged. Representing about one-third of global GDP, MICs are a major engine of global economic growth.


   Graduating From Lower- to Upper-Middle Income  

Countries graduate from one level to another depending on their GNI per capita. According to a June 2023 report by the World Bank, India continued to be a lower-middle-income country and is expected to continue to be so in 2024.



Countries that will move from low-income to lower-middle-income country categories are Guinea and Zambia. Countries moving from lower-middle income to upper-middle income are Indonesia, El Salvador, West Bank and Gaza, and Jordan. Countries moving from upper-middle income to high income are Guyana and American Samoa.




What Are the Income Levels of Countries?
The World Bank breaks down countries as a classification based on their gross national income (GNI) per capita. Its four main categories are low income, low-middle income, upper-middle income, and high income.




What Countries Are Middle-Income Countries?
Countries that are middle-income countries include Turkey, Iraq, Russia, Brazil, Argentina, Peru, Nigeria, Angola, India, and Pakistan.




Is China a Middle-Income Country?
Yes, China is considered a middle-income country. It is specifically an upper-middle-income country according to the World Bank.


   The Bottom Line  

The World Bank classifies countries based on gross national income (GNI) per capita to better analyze these nations. Middle-income countries are those with a GNI per capita between $1,136 and $13,845. Middle-income countries can be further categorized as lower-middle income and upper-middle income.
What Is a Middle Market Firm?  

The middle market is the segment of American businesses with annual revenues roughly in the range of $10 million to $1 billion, depending on the industry they operate in. There are about 200,000 middle-market firms in the U.S., most of them privately owned or closely held, and their annual revenues combined total more than $10 trillion.





Key Takeaways

Middle market businesses account for about one-third of the U.S. economy. About 48 million Americans are employed by middle market companies, and their numbers are expected to grow.Businesses in this sector tend to be service-oriented and may be relatively unknown outside their industries.Middle market companies are often financed through business development corporations (BDCs).When publicly traded, middle markets tend to trade as small-cap or micro-cap stocks.


   Understanding Middle Market Firms  

Middle market companies are responsible for about 48 million jobs with combined annual revenues of $10 trillion (which accounts for about one-third of annual U.S. private-sector gross receipts). That makes the middle market a powerhouse of the U.S. economy, though many of these companies are little known to the general public.



The middle market is a critical sector of the American economy and an important engine of job creation, with middle market employment growing more than twice as quickly as the national average. Companies in this sector are heavily concentrated in service-oriented activities including business services, health services, and educational services. Significant numbers are engaged in retail or wholesale trade, construction activity, or manufacturing.


   Middle Market Firm Characteristics  

There is no universally accepted definition of the middle market. Traditionally, annual revenues were the key differentiator. The Harvard Business Review defines the middle market as those businesses that earn between $10 million and $1 billion in annual revenue. Other sources may place the lower threshold as low as $5 million, or as high as $50 million.



Some analysts prefer to define middle-market firms by the value of their total assets. Others characterize the middle market as companies with between 500 and 1,000-1,500 employees. By this reckoning, small businesses have 500 or fewer employees.



The lack of a clear delineation can result in some gray areas when attempts are made to group businesses by the classic three-level approach that includes small business, middle-market business, and big business. Some cut the categories down to two and label all but the biggest businesses as small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).






The U.S. middle market generated about $10 trillion in combined revenues in 2021. If the U.S. middle market were a country, it would have the third-highest GDP in the world.


   Challenges for Middle Market Firms  

The interests of middle-market businesses may be relatively under-represented in policy and economic debates, from the local level to internationally. Most big businesses are publicly traded companies. They report financial information quarterly and employ lobbyists to represent their interests. Small businesses have associations that represent their interests.



The middle market, by comparison, is more amorphous and less transparent. They are low-profile, and their products and services may be generally recognized only by their customers.



The COVID-19 pandemic also hit SMEs especially hard. In fact, 43% of middle-market executives believe the pandemic will have some adverse effects on revenues in 2021. Even discounting the effects of the pandemic, significant challenges remain. According to a 2021 report, maintaining customer relationships continues to be difficult, with a majority of middle-market executives citing this as one of their top challenges right now.



Managing workforce disruption and keeping employees engaged and productive also continues to be an ongoing problem for middle market leaders.


  Funding for Middle Market Firms  

Relative to big public companies, middle-market businesses can have a tough time raising capital to expand or invest, and their costs of debt are typically higher. Although middle-market lenders, particularly boutique investment and commercial banks, aggressively compete for the business of the middle market, larger businesses enjoy the advantage of economies of scale. Many theories explain why this is the case but it often boils down to the added transaction costs banks undertake for due diligence and marketing activities when they cater to the middle market.



Middle market companies often look to business development companies (BDCs) for funding. These are similar to closed-end investment funds. Many BDCs are public companies whose shares trade on major stock exchanges. As investments, they can be somewhat high-risk but also offer high dividend yields.



To qualify as a BDC, a company must be registered in compliance with Section 54 of the Investment Company Act of 1940. It must be a domestic company whose class of securities is registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).



By regulation, a BDC must invest at least 70% of its assets in private or public U.S. firms with market values of less than $250 million. The companies they invest in are often young businesses in need of financing or companies that are struggling to emerge from financial difficulties. The BDC is required to provide managerial assistance to the companies in its portfolio.


   Investing in Middle Market Firms  

Most middle-market firms are not publicly traded, but they can be found among small-cap or micro-cap companies. Middle market companies are not usually considered big enough to be mid-cap stocks, which are defined as having a market capitalization between $2 billion and $10 billion.



There are several a number of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and mutual funds that focus on small-cap indexes including the Russell 2000 and the Russell Microcap Index.



Investors may also be able to invest directly in the shares of business development companies that provide financing to middle-market firms. Because BDCs are regulated investment companies (RICs), they must distribute over 90% of their profits to shareholders. That RIC status, though, means they don't pay corporate income tax on profits before they distribute them to shareholders. The result is above-average dividend yields.



According to BDC Investor.com, as of June 2021, the ten highest-yielding BDCs were posting yields from 9.19% to 21.99%.


   Middle Market vs. Main Street  

Main Street is an informal term for small businesses with a relatively small number of employees that take in a modest amount of revenue. The middle market is a step up from this, with larger operations, more employees, and revenues in the tens to hundreds of millions of dollars per year.



The middle market consists of companies that would make up small-cap and micro-cap stocks if they were listed on a stock exchange. These can be riskier than holding shares of larger, more mature companies, which tend to be more stable. At the same time, the growth opportunities and ability to be nimble can often be greater for the middle markets, providing higher potential returns.




What Is Middle Market Banking?
Middle market banking refers to an area of commercial banking that provides services to local governments, nonprofits, and companies with around $50 million to $1 billion of total revenue. In order to serve these clients, middle-market investment banks may need to specialize in specific areas of expertise.




What Is Middle Market Private Equity?
Middle market private equity refers to the sector of private equity businesses that invest in companies worth between $50 million and $500 million. Companies in this range tend to be well-established, without the risks of investing in a small startup.




What Is the Lower Middle Market?
The lower middle market is a smaller subset of middle-market firms, with a total valuation between about $10 and $100 million dollars. Because of their small size, these firms tend to be more attractive for mergers and acquisitions that the rest of the middle market.


   The Bottom Line  

Middle market firms are companies that occupy the range between small "Mom & Pop" businesses and major enterprises. These companies tend to be service-oriented and are rarely publicly traded. In the United States, middle market firms account for a large share of employment and overall business activity.
What Is the Middle Office?  

The middle office is the department in a financial services company, investment bank, or hedge fund that sits in between the front and back office. It typically manages risk and calculates profits and losses. It is generally in charge of information technology (IT) as well.





Key Takeaways

The middle office tracks and processes all of the deals made by the front office before being reconciled by the back office.The department is generally responsible for risk management and for a firm's information technology.The middle office grew out of the increasing complexity of modern financial transactions.


   How a Middle Office Works  

A financial services company is logically broken up into three parts: The front office includes sales personnel and corporate finance, the middle office manages risk and IT resources, and the back office provides administrative, support, and payment services. The middle office draws on the resources of both the front and the back offices.



Middle office and back office jobs generally do not directly produce revenue but are essential to managing risk and ensuring that transactions are correctly executed. They are considered an essential part of the company's infrastructure.



In the early days of foreign exchange and investment banking, responsibilities were generally split between the front office and the back office. Front office personnel included the salespeople, traders, and deal makers. Most had college degrees and many had MBAs. Back office personnel performed the clerical work and were only required to have high school diplomas.



As transactions and technology grew more complex, other functions developed and split off from the back office, creating the middle office. These employees usually have at least a bachelor's degree, and increasing numbers of them have either an MBA or a master's degree in technology.






On job sites, financial services companies generally identify these positions as "middle office" opportunities.


   Requirements of the Middle Office  

Middle office personnel is responsible for ensuring that the deal negotiated by the front office is accurately booked, processed, and paid for. This can include managing a wide range of International Swap Dealers Association (ISDA) agreements, tracking deals' profits and losses, and ensuring that all required compliance documents have been completed. Some firms have specialized legal support teams as part of the middle office.



Information technology functions of the office run the gamut from ensuring that paying and receiving functions are operational to designing software to implement trading strategies. IT middle office personnel also manage contracted software systems that are used for trading, such as Bloomberg and Reuters 3000. They support both the front and back office and are often on call 24 hours to ensure that essential market data is constantly captured and monitored.


   Other Considerations  

For some years, financial services companies have been moving back-office functions overseas in order to cut costs. Since the financial crisis of 2008, some middle office functions also have moved off-shore. The countries getting those jobs generally have a strong population of highly-educated workers and strong English language skills but a substantially lower pay scale. Popular target countries include Ireland and India.
What Is Middleman?  

The term middleman is an informal word for an intermediary in a transaction or process chain.





Key Takeaways

A middleman is a broker, go-between, or intermediary to a process or transaction.An intermediary will earn a fee or commission in return for services rendered in matching buyers and sellers.Many industries and business sectors utilize middlemen, from trade and commerce to wholesalers to stockbrokers.


   Understanding Middleman  

A middleman, or intermediary, will facilitate interaction between parties, typically for a commission or fee. Some critics say that businesses and customers should try to "cut out the middleman" by dealing directly with each other, avoiding any increased costs or commissions.



Intermediaries also make money by selling the product for more than its purchase price. This difference is called the "markup" or cost the buyer ends up paying. Intermediaries can be small companies or large corporations with an international presence.



In the supply chain, an intermediary may represent a distributor who purchases goods from the manufacturer and sells them to a retailer, often at an increased price. Salespeople are often considered middle-people, such as real estate agents who match homebuyers with sellers.



Certain industries, either by policy, infrastructure, or mandate, include an intermediate layer of business. For example, automobile makers typically do not sell vehicles directly to consumers. Instead, their products are sold through auto dealers, which may include various accessories, options, and upgrades to upsell cars at a higher premium. Auto dealerships try to sell pricier versions of cars in order to turn a greater profit for themselves, as a large portion of the sales revenue goes back to the manufacturer.



The same is true for electronics, appliances, and other retail products. Sellers of electronics and appliances may attempt to steer customers to higher-end products in order to secure a greater profit margin than low-priced items. Such intermediaries may be constrained by the manufacturer in the ways they can sell a product, including how it is marketed or if the product can be packaged with other items to create special offers.






The rise of e-commerce has changed the dynamics of where an intermediary fits in some types of industries, and legislation continues to evolve in response.


   Middleman Example  

In certain states, the sale of alcoholic beverages may be structured to require retailers, bars, and restaurants to purchase products through a liquor distributor. Under such policies, a winery cannot sell its products directly to retailers, thus making a middleman essential. This can limit the availability of their products as they are beholden to the intermediate distributors who control the channels they can pass their wine through.



Such constraints may also extend to the sale and shipment of their products from one state to another. Some states allow the sale and shipment of products such as wine directly to the consumer through online purchases, thus eliminating the layers of middlemen while other states prohibit this practice. This has proven to be a contentious challenge to the distribution segment of the industry, which relied on wine and spirits makers being required to ship their wares through them.
What Is Midstream?  

Midstream is a term used to describe one of the three major stages of oil and gas industry operations. Midstream activities include the processing, storing, transporting and marketing of oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids.



The two other major stages are upstream, which refers to raw crude oil and natural gas production, and downstream, which refers to the refining of crude oil into gasoline, diesel, jet, and other fuels. Today, many large oil companies undertake all streams of the process and are known as integrated oil companies.





Key Takeaways

Midstream refers to points in the oil production process that falls between upstream and downstream.In particular, midstream activities include the storage, processing, and transportation of petroleum products.These may include companies that specialize in operating tanker ships, pipelines, or storage facilities.


   Understanding Midstream Activities  

Midstream activities are commonly included as part of other operations for much of the global oil and gas industry. The midstream and downstream activities take place after the initial production phase, known as upstream, and through to the endpoint of sale. Many oil and gas companies are considered integrated because of their ability to combine upstream, midstream, and downstream activities as part of their overall operations.



The midstream industry designation is much more prevalent in the oil industry in the United States and Canada than in the rest of the world because of the large privately-owned oil pipelines and storage facilities in these countries. For example, the Keystone Pipeline System is an oil pipeline system in Canada and the United States, commissioned in 2010 and is now owned solely by TransCanada Corporation. Other pure midstream operating companies include names like Oasis Midstream Partners, Sanchez Midstream Partners, Hess Midstream, Magellan Midstream Partners, and EQT Midstream Partners. The designation in the U.S. of crude oil transportation and storage as a separate part of the production chain is what allows the midstream industry to exist.


   Midstream Example  

Magellan Midstream Partners states on their website that they own and operate five marine storage terminals located along coastal waterways with approximately 26 million barrels of aggregate storage capacity and approximately one million barrels of storage jointly owned through their Texas Frontera, LLC joint venture. The marine terminals provide distribution, storage, blending, inventory management and additive injection services for refiners, marketers, traders, and other end-users of petroleum products. These key services offered between raw upstream production and the refiners are an important part of the midstream business designation.



In Europe, the transportation and storage of crude tends to be integrated with the upstream production business. Major European oil companies such as Shell or BP tend to report production and transportation costs together in their annual financial results. Additionally, many European oil pipelines are controlled by governments of the countries whose territory they cross or by state-owned oil transportation companies in those countries. This state ownership tends to result in the absence of midstream as a separately designated part of the oil production value chain.
What Is MiFID II?  

MiFID II is a legislative framework instituted by the European Union (EU) to regulate financial markets in the bloc and improve protections for investors. Its aim is to standardize practices across the EU and restore confidence in the industry, especially after the 2008 financial crisis.





Key Takeaways

MiFID II, a European Union packet of financial industry reform legislation, rolled out on Jan. 3, 2018.MiFID II covers virtually every asset and profession within the EU financial services industry.MiFID II regulates off-exchange and OTC trading, essentially pushing it onto official exchanges.Increasing transparency of costs and improving record-keeping of transactions are among MiFID II's key regulations.


   Understanding MiFID II  

A revised version of the original MiFID, MiFID II rolled out on Jan. 3, 2018, more than six years after the European Commission, the EU's executive branch, adopted a legislative proposal for it. Technically, MiFID II applies to the legislative framework, and the rules it outlines are actually the Markets in Financial Instruments Regulation (MiFIR); but colloquially, the term MiFID is used to mean both.



The original Markets In Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID) went into effect in November 2007. The onset of the subsequent global financial crisis exposed some weaknesses in its provisions. It focused too narrowly on stocks (ignoring fixed-income vehicles, derivatives, currencies, and other assets) and did not address dealings with firms or products outside the EU, leaving the rules about those to be decided by individual members.



MiFID II harmonizes the application of oversight among member nations and broadens the scope of the regulations. In particular, it imposes more reporting requirements and tests in order to increase transparency and reduce the use of dark pools (private financial exchanges that allow investors to trade without revealing their identities) and over-the-counter (OTC) trading. Under the new rules, the trading volume of a stock in a dark pool is limited to 8% over 12 months. The new regulations also target high-frequency trading. Algorithms used for automated trading have to be registered, tested, and have circuit breakers included.



MiFID II extends the scope of requirements under MiFID to more financial instruments. Equities, commodities, debt instruments, futures and options, exchange-traded funds, and currencies all fall under its purview. If a product is available in an EU nation, it is covered by MiFID II—even if, say, the trader wishing to buy it is located outside the EU.






Preparations for MiFID II cost firms an estimated total of $2.1 billion, according to a report by Expand, a Boston Consulting Group company, and IHS Markit.



MiFID II not only covers virtually all aspects of financial investment and trading but also covers virtually all financial professionals within the EU. Bankers, traders, fund managers, exchange officials, and brokers—and their firms—all have to abide by its regulations. So do institutional and retail investors.



MiFID II places restrictions on inducements paid to investment firms or financial advisors by any third party in relation to services provided to clients. Banks and brokerages can no longer charge for research and transactions in a single bundle, forcing a clearer sense of the cost of each, and possibly improving the quality of research available to investors. Brokers have to provide more detailed reporting on their trades—50 more pieces of data, in fact— including price and volume information. They also have to store all communications, including phone conversations. Electronic trading is encouraged since it is easier to record and track.

What Is a Dark Pool?
Dark pools are private asset exchanges designed to provide additional liquidity and anonymity for trading large blocks of securities away from the public eye. They provide pricing and cost advantages to buy-side institutions such as mutual funds, and pension funds, which claim that these benefits ultimately accrue to the retail investors who invest in these funds. However, dark pools’ lack of transparency makes them susceptible to conflicts of interest by their owners and predatory trading practices by HFT firms.
What Is a Mill Levy?  

The mill levy is a property tax. It is applied to a property based on its assessed value. The rate of the tax is expressed in mills and is equal to one dollar per $1,000 dollars of assessed value. The mill levy is calculated by determining how much revenue each tax jurisdiction will need for the upcoming year to fund its budget for public services. For example, funding public schools and maintaining parks and recreation areas. That revenue is then divided by the total value of all property within the area. Finally, the rate from each jurisdiction is added to obtain the mill levy for the entire area.﻿﻿





Key Takeaways

The mill levy is a property tax applied based on the assessed value of the property.The rate of the tax is expressed in mills - one mill is equal to one dollar per $1,000 of assessed value.The tax is applied by local governments and other jurisdictions to raise revenue to cover its budget and to pay for public services such as schools.


   How Mill Levies Work  

There can be several taxing authorities in one region, which could include school, county, and city districts. When it comes to the mill levy, the rate of taxation is expressed in mills. This mill levy determines how much the taxable value of your property will be charged in real estate taxes.






Most jurisdictions use a percentage formula, which is known as an assessment ratio, to determine the property value for the mill levy.



Each year, the official assessed value of a property is usually set by a tax assessor and may be used to set the mill levy. In some cases, a percentage of the market value of the property can be used to set the mill levy instead.



To determine what the mill levy will be, most jurisdictions use a percentage formula, which is known as an assessment ratio, to determine the property value for the mill levy.





Fast Fact

A tax assessor usually sets the assessed value of a property for mill levy purposes. In some cases, a percentage of the market value of the property can be used to set the mill levy.


   Example of a Mill Levy  

As an example, if the entire property value in the area is $1 billion, and the school district needs $100 million in revenue, the county needs $10 million and the city needs $50 million. The tax levy for the school district would be $100 million divided by $1 billion or 0.10. The tax levy for the county would be 0.01 (10 million/1 billion), and the tax levy for the city would be 0.05 (50 million/1 billion).



Add all the tax levies up, and you get a mill levy of 0.16 or 160 mills (one mill = 0.001).



In general, mill levies are applied to real estate, land, buildings, and significant personal property such as cars and boats.
What Is the Mill Rate?  

The mill rate is the amount of tax payable per dollar of the assessed value of a property. The mill rate is based on "mills." It is a figure that represents the amount per $1,000 of the assessed value of the property, which is used to calculate the amount of property tax.





Key Takeaways

Mill rate is a tax rate—the amount of tax payable per dollar of the assessed value of a property.Mill is derived from the Latin word millesimum, meaning thousandth.As used in property tax, 1 mill is equal to $1 in property tax levied per $1,000 of a property's assessed value.Government entities set mill rates based on the total value of property within their jurisdiction, to provide the necessary tax revenue to cover projected expenses—roads, schools, emergency services, and so on—in their annual budgets.Property taxes are calculated by multiplying the assessed, taxable property value by the mill rate and then dividing that sum by 1,000.


   Understanding Mill Rate  

Mill rate is also known as the millage rate. The term "millage" is derived from a Latin word millesimum, meaning thousandth, with 1 mill being equal to 1/1000th of a currency unit. As used in relation to property tax, 1 mill is equal to $1 in property tax, which is levied per $1,000 of a property's determined taxable value.



You can find the millage rate for an individual property on the property deed itself or by calling your municipal tax office.  


   Where Does the Mill Rate Come From?  

The mill rate for your property is determined by who or what is taxing you. That means that different mill rates are charged by different agencies, including the township/city, the county, school boards, and/or emergency services districts. These are all combined to help calculate your final property tax bill. 



For example, once a budget is passed by your local government, known revenues are subtracted, which leaves the deficit to be raised through property taxes. This amount is divided by the value of all property in the town, which is then multiplied by 1,000. This figure represents the tax rate or the mill rate. 


   Calculating Property Taxes Using the Mill Rate  

Property taxes are calculated by multiplying the assessed, taxable property value by the mill rate and then dividing that sum by 1,000. The calculation formula is rendered as follows:



Property tax levied on property = (mill rate x taxable property value) ÷ 1,000



For example, if the mill rate is 7 and a taxpayer's personal residence has a taxable value of $150,000, then, using the calculation formula, the homeowner's property tax bill for his residence is $1,050. So that means that for every $1,000 of assessed value, $7 is owed in property taxes. 


   How Property Taxes Are Determined  

Property taxes are critical to funding the operations of municipal and other local government entities. Not all states levy income taxes, but all states do levy property taxes. Property taxes are often assessed by more than one government entity. For example, a single property may be assessed for both municipal and county taxes.



Government entities set mill rates based on the total value of property within the entity's jurisdiction, to provide the necessary tax revenue to cover projected expenses in their annual budgets, including things such as infrastructure, police and emergency services, and public schools. For this reason, and also because of fluctuating real estate values, a tax assessor typically updates the taxable value of the property annually. Mill rates frequently vary for different types of property, such as residential, commercial, or industrial properties.



Property tax is an ad valorem tax, which means it is based on value. The assessed tax value of the property is calculated using local real estate data and is usually a percentage of a property's fair market value, determined by multiplying the property's market value or appraisal value by an assessment ratio established by the local taxing authority. However, it is possible for the assessed tax value to be either higher or lower than a property's actual market value. If a property owner believes that his property has been assessed at an unreasonably high value, he can request a reassessment.



Some states have a homestead provision that exempts a specified dollar amount of a property's market value from assessment for property taxes. For example, in a state with a $50,000 homestead provision, only $150,000 of a $200,000 home would be subject to property taxes.




How Do You Calculate Property Taxes Based on Mill Rate?
The mill rate represents the amount of property tax that you pay on real estate. It is measured in mills, equivalent to a tenth of a percent. For example, a mill rate of 12 means that your property tax is equal to 1.2% of your property's assessed value. To calculate your property tax, multiply your property's mill rate by the assessed property value and divide it by 1,000.




How Do You Find Your Mill Rate?
Mill rates are calculated by local and municipal governments based on their financial needs. You can usually find the millage rates for your area by calling or checking the website for your local government or assessor's office.




How Do You Calculate Percentage from Mill Rate?
Property taxes are often measured in mills, representing a tenth of a percent. To determine tax rate as a percentage, multiply the mill rate by 10.
What Is the Mill Rate?  

The mill rate is the amount of tax payable per dollar of the assessed value of a property. The mill rate is based on "mills." It is a figure that represents the amount per $1,000 of the assessed value of the property, which is used to calculate the amount of property tax.





Key Takeaways

Mill rate is a tax rate—the amount of tax payable per dollar of the assessed value of a property.Mill is derived from the Latin word millesimum, meaning thousandth.As used in property tax, 1 mill is equal to $1 in property tax levied per $1,000 of a property's assessed value.Government entities set mill rates based on the total value of property within their jurisdiction, to provide the necessary tax revenue to cover projected expenses—roads, schools, emergency services, and so on—in their annual budgets.Property taxes are calculated by multiplying the assessed, taxable property value by the mill rate and then dividing that sum by 1,000.


   Understanding Mill Rate  

Mill rate is also known as the millage rate. The term "millage" is derived from a Latin word millesimum, meaning thousandth, with 1 mill being equal to 1/1000th of a currency unit. As used in relation to property tax, 1 mill is equal to $1 in property tax, which is levied per $1,000 of a property's determined taxable value.



You can find the millage rate for an individual property on the property deed itself or by calling your municipal tax office.  


   Where Does the Mill Rate Come From?  

The mill rate for your property is determined by who or what is taxing you. That means that different mill rates are charged by different agencies, including the township/city, the county, school boards, and/or emergency services districts. These are all combined to help calculate your final property tax bill. 



For example, once a budget is passed by your local government, known revenues are subtracted, which leaves the deficit to be raised through property taxes. This amount is divided by the value of all property in the town, which is then multiplied by 1,000. This figure represents the tax rate or the mill rate. 


   Calculating Property Taxes Using the Mill Rate  

Property taxes are calculated by multiplying the assessed, taxable property value by the mill rate and then dividing that sum by 1,000. The calculation formula is rendered as follows:



Property tax levied on property = (mill rate x taxable property value) ÷ 1,000



For example, if the mill rate is 7 and a taxpayer's personal residence has a taxable value of $150,000, then, using the calculation formula, the homeowner's property tax bill for his residence is $1,050. So that means that for every $1,000 of assessed value, $7 is owed in property taxes. 


   How Property Taxes Are Determined  

Property taxes are critical to funding the operations of municipal and other local government entities. Not all states levy income taxes, but all states do levy property taxes. Property taxes are often assessed by more than one government entity. For example, a single property may be assessed for both municipal and county taxes.



Government entities set mill rates based on the total value of property within the entity's jurisdiction, to provide the necessary tax revenue to cover projected expenses in their annual budgets, including things such as infrastructure, police and emergency services, and public schools. For this reason, and also because of fluctuating real estate values, a tax assessor typically updates the taxable value of the property annually. Mill rates frequently vary for different types of property, such as residential, commercial, or industrial properties.



Property tax is an ad valorem tax, which means it is based on value. The assessed tax value of the property is calculated using local real estate data and is usually a percentage of a property's fair market value, determined by multiplying the property's market value or appraisal value by an assessment ratio established by the local taxing authority. However, it is possible for the assessed tax value to be either higher or lower than a property's actual market value. If a property owner believes that his property has been assessed at an unreasonably high value, he can request a reassessment.



Some states have a homestead provision that exempts a specified dollar amount of a property's market value from assessment for property taxes. For example, in a state with a $50,000 homestead provision, only $150,000 of a $200,000 home would be subject to property taxes.

Millennial is the name given to the generation born from 1981 to 1996, dates now clarified by the Pew Research Center, although some have seen them as starting in 1980 and being born as late as 2004. Also known as Generation Y (Gen Y), the millennial generation follows Generation X (Gen X). In terms of numbers, it has edged out the baby boomers as the most significant generation in American history.



Millennials are so named because they were born near, or came of age during, the dawn of the 21st century—the new millennium. As the first to be born into a digital world, members of this group are considered digital natives. Technology has always been a part of their everyday lives—it’s been estimated that they check their phones as many as 150 times daily—and serving them has been a major contributing factor to the growth of Silicon Valley and other technology hubs. 



Research has shown the millennial generation to be the most ethnically and racially diverse in U.S. history. Gen Y tends to be progressive in their political views and voting habits and less religiously observant than their predecessors, Gen X.





Key Takeaways

Millennial is the name given to the generation born from 1981 through 1996, also known as Generation Y (Gen Y).It is the biggest generation in American history in terms of numbers.The increasing wealth gap has meant that millennials start off with less household income.Millennials also face other financial obstacles like a record amount of student loan debt.Millennials often see their career trajectories and retirement differently from the way that their parents and grandparents did in the past. Millennials tend to want to follow their ambitions while they’re young and not have to wait to travel, create their own nonprofit, or pursue hobbies.


   Millennial Economic Picture  

Millennials face the most uncertain economic future of any generation in America since the Great Depression. Three decades of stagnant wages were followed by the Great Recession (which left more than 15% of those in their early 20s out of work). They then came the coronavirus pandemic, which upended the financial and housing markets plus impacted employment across multiple sectors.



The job market has improved since the recession and rebounded since the pandemic. Still, millennials and everyone else face wage stagnation, thanks in part to a 20-year trend of decreasing labor market mobility. Labor market mobility started to stagnate in 2000, just as the oldest millennials entered the job market. When workers don’t move around, from both job to job and region to region, employers have more power when negotiating wages—a phenomenon called monopsony—which translates into employees getting paid less.



Unfortunately for young people whose careers coincided with this trend, it’s difficult to make up lost earnings from early, slow years. Add to this financial reality the record amount of debt (mainly from student loans) that this generation is carrying, and there is one reason for financial stress.



However, millennials have been working hard in the past decade. According to a 2021 quarterly report, Millennials live in the present. They focus on their immediate financial well-being by maintaining a budget setting up emergency funds. As a whole, they lead by the most significant margins on long-range financial goals.






  Work and Income  

The increasing wealth gap has meant that millennials start with less household income. So, their most popular personal finance priority is to have enough money for day-to-day living expenses. During the recession, some millennials postponed getting higher education or additional degrees due to a sluggish job market.



As the job market improved, many millennials chose the gig economy. When the pandemic hit and social distancing regulations were implemented, many millennials found their jobs went remote. And many millennials "flourished," and 74% of millennials didn't plan to return to the workplace five days a week, according to a 2020 Gallup poll.



Of course, some millennials struggle to land full-time positions and are making do with part-time positions, but overall, this group is earning more than other generations. According to the U. S. Census Bureau, the median income for a millennial household is $71,566.


  Becoming Financially Independent  

As many younger millennials and Generation Z, their younger siblings, do, living paycheck to paycheck doesn’t make financial independence easy. Gaining independence should be income-driven rather than frugality-fueled. While spending frivolously is never advisable, cutting back on your Starbucks intake isn’t going to make your fortune. Accumulating wealth requires broader, long-term thinking.



For instance, if you’re making $30,000 a year, it will be nearly impossible to amass a large sum of money—even if you were to save all of your extra pennies. For instance, broadening your earning capacity—via education or work experience—can help increase your worth and broaden your income horizons. 


  Getting Out of Debt  

Paying off student loan debt has become increasingly difficult even for those with a job. While it’s natural to prioritize paying off debt as soon as possible, that may not be the best course. You need to have your money working for you, too.



One approach is to leverage what funds you have: Extend your college loan repayment period to lower your monthly payments, and use the extra cash to start building a retirement nest egg. In your 20s, you’re at the time when compound interest is most in your favor because you have decades for even small amounts of money to grow. It’s also a good time to take risks because if an investment does tank, then your portfolio has time to recover from losses. 



Also, being in debt is not all bad. Particular sorts of installment debt—like student or auto loans—can be helpful. As long as you pay them in a timely and regular fashion, they help you establish a good credit history. You need a good history and credit score to obtain everything from a residential lease to a bank loan (and the most favorable interest rate possible for it). Not only is it OK to have the right kind of debt, but it can also make a lot of financial sense. Take a basic capital investment, such as a car. You could obtain a low-interest auto loan and pay it off in small, regular installments while more of your cash remains available to put toward something else.



Paying your monthly credit card bills on time is crucial to building your credit rating. Try to pay your bill in full at the end of each month to avoid racking up interest charges that can quickly snowball. Also, having several cards (but not owing anything close to your credit limit—charge no more than 35% of your limit on each card) will help your credit utilization ratio. This percentage is another important factor when being evaluated for a car loan or a mortgage.






The net worth gulf between the rich and the middle class has been at its highest level since 1941, as well.


  Saving for a Big Purchase  

Saving for big-ticket items, like a home of one's own, is another goal. Unfortunately, lenders are imposing stricter guidelines for significant types of financing, especially mortgages. Therefore, millennials may need to make a substantial down payment if they want to purchase a home. Most savings accounts do not provide a high yield on returns, which means you could lose money over time if the interest rates don't pace with inflation.



Savings accounts cause you to lose money over time because their low-interest rates do not keep pace with inflation. They're also subject to maintenance fees that can nibble away at your balance. It's not terrible to keep a small emergency fund in the bank—after all, it's still Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. (FDIC)-insured—but the bulk of savings should be elsewhere.


  The Millennial Life View  

Millennials often see their career trajectories and retirement differently from their parents and grandparents saw theirs. Frequently dubbed the “instant gratification generation,” they don’t want to work first for a big company and later try to do their own thing and enjoy life. They want to pursue ambitions now, whether going for a dream job right out of college, working for someone else’s promising startup, or creating a location-independent business. They want a job that allows an outstanding work/life balance while they’re young, so they don’t have to wait to travel, create their own nonprofit, or pursue hobbies. They may even be planning not to retire because they love their work.






Another smart financial move is buying long-term disability insurance while you’re young and healthy, which qualifies you for better premiums.


  Entrepreneur for Life  

Many millennials see themselves working forever, but not because they expect to be forced into that situation by a bad economy or poor financial planning. They envision a lifelong career because of their passion for what they do.



"I have taken a very different approach than my parents," said Michael Solari, Certified Financial Planner and principal with Solari Financial Planning, a New Hampshire-based, fee-only financial planning firm with offices in Bedford and Nashua, NH. "Initially, when I got out of college, I took the normal path working for a large company, but after I got laid off in 2009, I decided to take my career into my own hands. I love financial planning, so I started working toward creating my own firm." Solari's company caters to young professionals. "I'm so happy with my decision, and I plan to work until I can't physically," he said.



The firm provides Solari the ability to create his schedule to give him a work/life balance, which is most important because he observed his parents being strapped to their companies. "Retirement is for people who are unhappy with their careers," he adds.



Even if you're planning to work throughout your life, you still need to save for retirement; you also need a safety net in case you can't work forever because of illness or disability—or because you're pushed out of your job and can't find another. And if you change your mind one day, you'll appreciate having the flexibility that retirement savings will give you. Investing in the stock market, using ladder CDs, or opening a high-yield money market account, are all ways to grow your money. Investing $100 per month in the stock market for the next 30 years would give you approximately $122,000, assuming a 7% return.


   Millennials and Retirement  

You would think retirement planning would be a no-brainer for this young group, which has watched parents and grandparents struggle so much with recessions, saving money, and real estate booms and busts. They should know that Social Security and company pension plans are no longer reliable retirement income options—especially the latter, as private-sector employers eschew defined-benefit plans in favor of defined-contribution plans such as 401(k) plans, which shift much, if not all, of the savings burden onto the employee.



Still, this is not the case for all millennials and their families. Some of them used retirement accounts when they lost their jobs during the pandemic, which impacted employment and housing for millions of Americans.


  Can Millennials Retire?  

Millennials are planning for their future but not enough of them. Approximately 21% of millennials do not have a job that provides an employer-sponsored retirement plan, according to a 2021 Transamerica study.



Another cause for concern: A full 70% of the folks surveyed believed that once they’re retirees, they’ll be able to survive on $36,000 a year. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the problem with this perception is that in 2018, the average yearly expenses for those ages 65 to 74 were $56,268 a year.



If you even saved up enough to live on $36,000 a year from a retirement account, it will likely not be enough. “With the cost of goods, food, and housing at such inflated prices now, millennials will not be able to live off of $36,000 a year in retirement,” said Carlos Dias Jr., founder and managing partner of Dias Wealth LLC in Lake Mary, FL. ”Based on an inflation rate of 3%, the value of $36,000 today will be reduced to $14,831.52 in 30 years.” The disparity in perceived retirement funding needs could easily lead to financial pain for retirement-age millennials.



Millennials who invest in the stock market may see a rosier retirement picture. Over the long haul, the stock market has produced return rates hovering in the 10% range, and those who start investing while young benefit from those extra years.


  Partial Retirement Now  

Living a partially retired lifestyle is the most moderate approach. You will probably need a part-time job with a decent salary that allows you to work less and continue saving for the future. You might achieve this goal through freelancing on your schedule or by running or working for a location-independent business that lets you combine work and travel or hobbies.



Your long-term saving and investment strategy should be based on whether you want. Do you aspire to a partial retirement plus working forever as a freelancer, or partial retirement now plus a conventional retirement down the road? These are questions to ask yourself before leaving a full-time job.






Those considering any form of early retirement need to perform a considerable amount of research and consider numerous variables to ensure its financial feasibility. In addition to extensively planning ahead to live frugally, it’s crucial to still have enough money set aside in the form of an emergency fund. Individuals who don’t account for unexpected expenses in their budgets may find their retirement plans derailed by a single car accident or injury.


   How Millennials Invest  

While millennials can sometimes be wary about investing, the availability of social media tools is making it easier and more comfortable for this age group to learn. To ensure that they do not experience the same problems as previous generations, millennials are approaching investing in an entirely different manner from parents and grandparents.



Given their love for anything tech-related, it should come as little surprise that millennials are taking advantage of a variety of high-tech and social media tools that allow them to plow their wealth into the investment vehicles of their choice. They are now leveraging social networking platforms, websites, and mobile apps to do everything from following stock-picking tips to finding financial planners. All it takes is clicks on an app for millennials to review a prospectus, get advice, and even commit funds—and they reward companies that let them do so. Factors such as social responsibility and environmental responsibility also frequently play a crucial role in millennials' money.



Millennials are also more likely to take advantage of online tools for monitoring their investments. With such tools, investors can review their portfolios anytime they desire rather than waiting for quarterly reports to arrive in the mail—and this group takes full advantage. Sixty-one percent of millennials approved of robo-advisors for investing their money.


  New Breed of Investing Tools  

Millennials are comfortable with digital banking and robo-advisors, as they came of age during the technology boom. Millennials use a variety of apps, including.



Wealthfront: A wealth management system, Wealthfront emphasizes asset allocation features with low fees.
FutureAdvisor: This online investment advisor offers the capability of managing investments automatically for a low fee.
SigFig: This free personal finance service provides users with automated investment advice.
LearnVest: New investors who may need assistance in creating a personalized financial plan can utilize this platform to get matched with their own personal planners.
Mint: Mint works by compiling all of a user’s financial accounts into a single web-based platform, where they can be analyzed and monitored. Users can view their funds with separate account balances from their smartphone, computer, or tablet. In addition, Mint makes it possible to synchronize investments, bank accounts, and debit and credit cards, then categorize cash movement and expenses based on where it is spent.
Acorns: This investment app specifically targets millennials who might not have a lot of additional cash to invest. Acorns track debit and credit card purchases and round up those purchases to the nearest dollar, then takes the difference and puts it aside for investing. After reaching a total of $5, Acorns invests the money in investment portfolios selected by the user.




What Age Range Is Millennial?
According to the Pew Research Center, “millennial” applies to anyone born from 1981 through 1996.




Where Did the Name Millennial Come From?
Millennials are so named due to them being the first generation to come of age in the new millennium, according to the Pew Research Institute. The term Generation Y (Gen Y) is also used in reference to this generation, due to them following Generation X (Gen X).




How Much Money Do Millennials Make?
According to 2020 data from the U.S. Census Bureau, millennials earn a pretax income of $71,566 in their households.


   The Bottom Line  

At the end of the day, many millennials are planning for retirement, even if it looks a little different than their parents' or grandparents' post-work lives. For some, working extra hard by building passive income streams, like investing in real estate, may help cushion the potential for early or partial retirement. Other millennials who don't anticipate a robust financial exit from their jobs may incorporate travel and enjoyable activities throughout their working life.



Millennials who weathered the recession or watched their parents' struggle may have values that force them to be mindful of how they spend, focusing on discretionary income, taking at least one vacation each year, and pursuing different activities and experiences as often as they can. Overall, as a generation, data shows most millennials are presently saving for retirement and remaining hopeful about their financial futures.
Milton Friedman was a U.S. economist and Nobel laureate known as the most influential advocate of free-market capitalism and monetarism in the 20th century.



At the beginning of his career in the 1950s and 1960s, Friedman’s strong advocacy of monetary policy over fiscal policy and free markets over government intervention was considered radical by the established macroeconomics community, which was dominated by the Keynesian position that fiscal policy—government spending and tax policies to influence the economy—is more important than monetary policy—control of the overall supply of money available to banks, consumers, and businesses—and that an interventionist government could moderate recessions by using fiscal policy to prop up aggregate demand, spur consumption, and reduce unemployment.





Key Takeaways

Milton Friedman, one of the leading economic voices of the latter half of the 20th century, popularized many economic ideas that are still important today—most importantly, free-market capitalism and monetarism.Friedman's economic theories became what is known as monetarism, which refuted important parts of Keynesian economics, a school of thought that was dominant in the first half of the 20th century.Friedman’s advocacy of monetarism was so effective that he turned the tide of economic thought away from Keynesian fiscal policy toward monetary policy focused on control of the money supply to control inflation.Over the course of his academic career, Friedman wrote influential articles on the modern economy and published pioneering books that changed the way economics is taught.



In a direct challenge to the Keynesian establishment, Friedman and his fellow monetarists held that governments could foster economic stability by controlling the supply of money that flows into the economy and allowing the rest of the market to fix itself (monetarism) and argued for a return to the free market, including smaller government and deregulation in most areas of the economy (free-market capitalism).



By the time Friedman died in 2006 at the age of 94, his theories had been so influential that the Wall Street Journal said that he had “reshaped modern capitalism” and “provided the intellectual foundations for the anti-inflation, tax-cutting, and antigovernment policies” of President Ronald Reagan and British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.


   Education and Early Career  

Milton Friedman (1912 to 2006) was born to immigrant parents in Brooklyn, N.Y., and grew up in a small town in in New Jersey, 20 miles from New York City. In his Nobel biography, Friedman described his family as “warm and supportive”—but the family income as “small and highly uncertain.” His father died during his senior year in high school, and he took various jobs to supplement a scholarship to Rutgers University, where he earned an undergraduate degree in mathematics and economics in 1932. On the recommendation of a Rutgers professor, Friedman was awarded a scholarship to an economics graduate program at the University of Chicago in 1932.



Over the next 14 years, in addition to academic roles at the University of Chicago and Columbia University, Friedman held a series of government roles that deepened his expertise in mathematical statistics and economic theory and contributed to publications on consumption and income analysis that launched his career.



For example, Friedman’s consumer budget study at the National Resources Committee contributed to his famous Theory of the Consumption Function, and his professional income study (Incomes from Independent Professional Practice) at the National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER) introduced the groundbreaking concepts of permanent and transitory income (his permanent income hypothesis) into economic science.



Prior to earning a Ph.D. in Economics from Columbia University in 1946, Friedman spent World War II on a select team of statistical analysts working on wartime tax policy for the U.S. Treasury Department (1941 to 1943) and serving as mathematical statisticians on weapon design, military tactics, and metallurgical experiments at Columbia University (1943 to 1945). Of note, during these early years at the U.S. Treasury, the famous anti-taxation crusader recommended increasing taxes to suppress wartime inflation and devised the first system of income tax withholding.


   The University of Chicago and Hoover lnstitution (1946 to 2006)  

In 1946, Friedman accepted an offer to teach economic theory at the University of Chicago and spent the next 30 years conducting groundbreaking analysis and developing free-market theories that challenged Keynesian economics—the school of thought that had dominated macroeconomics since the New Deal.



Workshop on Money and Banking: A key institutional accomplishment during this period at the University of Chicago was Friedman’s establishment of a money and banking workshop that allowed his monetary studies to evolve from individual scholarship into a cumulative body of work that drove the revival of both empirical and theoretical research in the fields of monetary history and statistics.



The Chicago School of Economics: Friedman also became the most famous alumnus of the Chicago School of Economics, a neoclassical school founded in the 1930s by his professor, Frank Knight, to promote free markets and the concept of rational expectations, a macroeconomic theory that holds that individuals base decisions on three factors—human rationality, available information, and past experiences—which means both that current expectations directly influence the future economy and that economists can accurately model future inflation and interest rates with no need for government intervention.



Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences (1976): In 1976, shortly before he retired from the University of Chicago, Friedman was awarded the Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences for his achievements in the fields of consumption analysis, monetary history and theory, and for his demonstration of the complexity of stabilization policy.



 Hoover lnstitution of Stanford University: From 1977, when he retired from active teaching at the University of Chicago, until his death in 2006, Friedman served as a Senior Research Fellow at the Hoover lnstitution of Stanford University, a public policy think tank promoting the principles of individual, economic, and political freedom.


   Friedman the Theoretical Economist  

Certain of Friedman’s accomplishments as a theoretical economist have been so significant that even vocal neo-Keynesian critics admire the brilliance of his logic, including his assertion that economic models should be judged by the accuracy of their predictions about behavior—not by their psychological realism.



For example, in Friedman’s rational behavior model on consumption behavior, consumer preferences can be expressed mathematically in terms of utility, and consumer choices are driven by rational calculations to maximize utility. Until then, Keynesian economists had explained consumer decisions more loosely in psychological terms, e.g., a tendency to spend some (but not all) of any increase in income.



Notable praise from ideological opponents includes Paul Krugman’s statement that “Friedman’s two greatest triumphs as an economic theorist came from applying the hypothesis of rational behavior to questions other economists had thought beyond its reach.”


  Theory of the Consumption Function  

Friedman’s first universally applauded application of the hypothesis of rational behavior to economic patterns was A Theory of the Consumption Function, his 1957 book that made the case for his permanent income hypothesis—a consumer spending theory that states that saving and spending decisions are based on perceptions of permanent—not temporary—changes to income. People spend at a level consistent with their expected long-term income and save only if current income is higher than expected permanent income. By effectively resolving previous inaccuracies in the analysis of the relationship between income and spending. Friedman laid the foundation for all subsequent economic analysis of spending and saving patterns.


  Prediction of Stagflation  

Another indisputable Friedman victory, praised by critics as well as admirers, was that his rational-behavior explanation of inflation accurately predicted a phenomenon that establishment Keynesians thought was impossible: stagflation, a period of stagnant economic growth with simultaneous high inflation and high unemployment.



In 1967, when Friedman presented his prediction of stagflation in a presidential address to the American Economic Association, he was challenging prevailing economic theories based on the Phillips curve, an economic model that demonstrated an historical correlation between unemployment and inflation that Keynesian economists had always assumed was stable, i.e., that high inflation would always be associated with low unemployment and low inflation with high unemployment.



At the time, Keynesian economists had been using the Phillips curve to argue that the stable tradeoff between unemployment and inflation justified expansionary fiscal policies and deficit spending that drove higher inflation, because it would keep unemployment low. Friedman’s counterargument to the Keynesians in 1967 was that, even though the data did show a correlation between inflation and unemployment, it was only a temporary trade-off—not a stable correlation—and both inflation and unemployment would eventually be high at the same time. Friedman’s rational behavior argument was that consumers dealing with long-term inflation eventually build expectations of future inflation into saving and spending decisions, which eventually cancels the power of high inflation to keep employment high.



When the stagflation of the late 1970s proved the accuracy of Friedman’s prediction that the historical correlation between inflation and unemployment would eventually break down, it was hailed as “one of the great triumphs of postwar economics.”


   Monetarism and the Great Depression  

When Friedman won the Nobel Prize in 1976, the Committee cited a book on monetarism that he and his colleague Anna Schwartz had published in 1963: A Monetary History of the United States, 1867–1960. In this book, Friedman used highly detailed theoretical and empirical analysis of the role of money in the U.S. economy since the Civil War to make the anti-Keynesian case that control of the money supply was a primary tool of economic management—as it had been throughout pre-Keynesian economics.



The argument against monetary policy had been dominant since the Great Depression in the 1930s, when the massive economic crisis made interest rates so low that there was no incentive to invest—and Keynesians believed that any additional cash pumped into the economy would have just been held by individuals and banks without jumpstarting the economy. In that context, Keynesians successfully advocated fiscal policy (primarily government spending) over monetary policy to pull the economy out of the Great Depression.



The most controversial position in Friedman’s 1967 book targeted this Keynesian approach to the Great Depression—and it became quite influential with economists and the general public: his argument that the government (the Federal Reserve) made the Great Depression worse by not enacting monetary policies. In the book, Friedman claimed that—if the Federal Reserve had prevented the dramatic drop in money supply by bailing out banks in the early 1930s—they could have prevented the wave of bank failures that made people decide to hold cash rather than make deposits and made banks hold deposits rather than make loans to revive the economy.



One of the reasons that an anti-government economist like Friedman would advocate any government action at all is that monetary policy is the least interventionalist (and ideally apolitical) action that the government can take in the economy. For example, the Federal Reserve is a central bank, so it controls the monetary base—the total currency in circulation and in bank vaults as well as bank deposits at the Federal Reserve (but not the bank accounts of individuals).



All the Federal Reserve had to do to increase the money supply (according to Friedman) was to create more monetary base and then let market forces play out—with no further government involvement. In contrast, Keynesian fiscal policies required much more government involvement in the economy. For example, a government-funded public works project to increase employment would not only be administered by government officials but it could also be used to serve political ends.



Neo-Keynesian critics of the book include Paul Krugman, who—although he called A Monetary History a "vast work of extraordinary scholarship”—took exception to Friedman’s argument that the Federal Reserve made the Great Depression worse by not enacting monetary policies. The Fed did increase the monetary aggregate that is under their control—the monetary base—so Krugman considers it highly debatable to say that the Fed could have prevented the crash of the money supply that in turn triggered the collapse of spending that deepened the depression. (Money supply is a different monetary aggregate that includes currency plus bank deposits that can be used as cash.)



Krugman also cautioned that what Friedman claimed in the book—that the Federal Reserve had turned a cyclical recession into a major depression by failing to bail out the banks—was widely misinterpreted by some economists and the public as Friedman believing that the Federal Reserve had caused the Great Depression, which made the depression a failure of big government—not a failure of unrestricted free markets.


   Real-World Application of Monetarism  

Friedman first introduced monetarism in his 1959 book, A Program for Monetary Stability, and for the next three decades monetarism was a major topic of economic debate. In subsequent publications and public appearances over the next 25 years, he made the case for controlling the money supply so effectively that his reputation as an economist was defined to a large extent by the monetarism doctrine he created.



However, by the 1980s, in the wake of notable failures of major monetary policy initiatives in the real world, some of his staunchest proponents began to reverse their support of monetarism. When an avowed monetarist In the U.K., Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, enacted monetary policy to control inflation in the early 1980s, the inflation rate jumped to 23%—and monetarism was abandoned by 1982. In the U.S., when the Federal Reserve attempted monetarism by steadily growing the money supply to control inflation in the late 1970s, the painful recession of 1981-1982—with interest rates at the highest levels since the Civil War and unemployment in double digits—was the result.



By 1982, the U.S. had abandoned monetarism in practice—and in 1986, the New York Times reported that Beryl Sprinkel, President Reagan's Chief Economist and one of the “most tenacious partisans” of monetarism, had publicly disavowed the theory.



Of note, when asked about the failed U.S. attempt, Friedman said that what happened wasn't a failure of monetarism—it was an execution failure by the Federal Reserve, i.e., they had focused on interest rates instead of money. '“Monetarism would work, if the Fed plugged the policy into a computer and relied mostly on the computer to steer the economy.”



In this context, critics have attributed Friedman’s strong advocacy of monetarism to a primarily partisan motivation: monetarism served his unilateral anti-government agenda. Because he believed that the Federal Reserve should grow the money supply at a steady, low, fixed rate without even small deviations in response to economic conditions, monetary policy could be on autopilot—and government officials would have no control at all.





Friedman's Monetarism vs. Keynesian Economics


John Maynard Keynes and Milton Friedman were two of the most influential economic and public policy thinkers of the 20th century. If Keynes was the most influential economic thinker of the first half of the 20th century, Friedman was the most influential economic thinker of the second half.
Until Friedman, Keynesian economics was the dominant paradigm in economic thought. To a large extent, U.S. government policy was driven by Keynesian principles of interventionist fiscal policy to smooth out recessions and prop up aggregate demand, including strategic government spending to spur consumption and alleviate unemployment.
Critics of Keynes have labelled his theories as pseudo-scientific justification for short-sighted elected politicians to run fiscal deficits and accumulate massive levels of government debt.
While Keynes has remained popular—and he is widely credited with creating the first systematic approach to macroeconomic government policy—Friedman’s arguments against Keynesian fiscal policy and for monetary policy have been dominant since the 1980s.
Critics of Friedman have said that he inspired policies that “put millions…out of work in pursuit of low inflation” and “demonized almost everything the government did, no matter how beneficial or democratically chosen.” As James Galbraith, the son of the liberal economist John Kenneth Galbraith, put it: “Milton Friedman didn't make a distinction between the big government of the People's Republic of China and the big government of the United States."



   The Public Face of Free Markets  

In 1976, when Friedman was awarded the Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences for his work on consumption analysis, monetary history and theory, and the complexity of stabilization policy, it marked the turning of the tide away from three decades of Keynesian Economics and toward the Chicago School of Economics he had co-founded.



With this international validation of his theories and the major intellectual victory of his prediction of stagflation in the late 1970s—something establishment Keynesians generally thought was impossible—Friedman became the new public face of free markets. 



After three decades of Keynesian dominance, Friedman reshaped academic thought in economics around a laissez-faire, free-market emphasis on prices, inflation, and human incentives—a direct counter to Keynes' focus on employment, interest, and public policy.



Over the next three decades, Friedman and his colleagues at the Chicago School of Economics argued against deficit spending and expansionary fiscal policy and for monetarism, deregulation in most areas of the economy, and a return to the free-market, small-government principles of classic economists, such as Adam Smith.


   Friedman the Public Intellectual  

One of Friedman’s most significant accomplishments was the extent to which his theories influenced government policy and public opinion as well as economic research. As the Nobel Committee noted in 1976, “It is very rare for an economist to wield such influence, directly and indirectly, not only on the direction of scientific research but also on actual policies.” At his death in 2006, Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said: “Among economic scholars, Milton Friedman had no peer. The direct and indirect influences of his thinking on contemporary monetary economics would be difficult to overstate.



Friedman’s range as a spokesperson was equally impressive. In addition to having the ear of powerful politicians and writing academic papers, he reached the public through popular books, columns, and television appearances. From debating highly technical economic principles at the academic level to communicating the economic benefits of free markets and small government to television audiences in direct, plain language, few public intellectuals in any field have been as effective.



During Friedman's landmark interviews on Phil Donahue's show in 1979 and 1980, the host said his guest was "a man who will never be accused of making economics confusing," and told Friedman: "The nice thing about you is that when you speak, I almost always understand you."



In addition to lectures on college campuses (e.g., Stanford and NYU), Friedman had a 10-series television program entitled "Free to Choose," based on his best-selling book with the same name,



Economist Walter Block, sometimes a friendly agitator of Friedman, memorialized his contemporary's 2006 death by writing, "Milton's valiant, witty, wise, eloquent and yes, I'll say it, inspirational analysis must stand out as an example to us all."


   Communicating Economics to the Masses  

One measure of the extent to which Friedman has shifted the center of debate about the proper role of government in the economy is the fact that certain of his core ideas have become popular wisdom.


  "Judge policies by their results, not their intentions."  

In many ways, Friedman was an idealist and libertarian activist, but his economic analysis was always grounded in practical reality. He famously told Richard Heffner, host of "The Open Mind," in an interview: "One of the great mistakes is to judge policies and programs by their intentions rather than their results."



Many of Friedman's most controversial positions were based on this principle. He opposed raising the minimum wage because he felt it unintentionally harmed young and low-skilled workers, particularly minorities. He also opposed tariffs and subsidies because they unintentionally harmed domestic consumers.



His famous 1989 "Open Letter" to then-drug czar Bill Bennett called for the decriminalization of all drugs, mostly because of the devastating unintended effects of the drug war. This letter lost Friedman a swath of conservative supporters, who he said failed "to recognize that the very measures you favor are a major source of the evils you deplore."


  "Inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon."  

The most famous excerpt from Friedman's writings and speeches is: "Inflation is always and everywhere a monetary phenomenon." He defied the intellectual climate of his era and reasserted the quantity theory of money as a viable economic tenet. In a 1956 paper titled "Studies in the Quantity Theory of Money," Friedman found that, in the long run, increased monetary growth increases prices but does not really affect output.



Friedman's work busted the classic Keynesian dichotomy on inflation, which asserted that prices rose from either "cost-push" or "demand-pull" sources. It also put monetary policy on the same level as fiscal policy.


  "Technocrats must not control the economy."  

In a 1980 Newsweek column, Milton Friedman said: "If you put the federal government in charge of the Sahara Desert, in five years there'd be a shortage of sand." Though perhaps poetic, this famous quote illustrates Friedman’s often doctrinaire opposition to government intervention into the economy; the Sahara Desert has in fact long been largely owned by various (African) national governments and has never experienced a shortage of sand. 



Friedman was a vocal critic of government power and was convinced free markets operated better on grounds of morality and efficiency. In terms of the actual economics, Friedman rested on a few truisms and basic, incentive-based analyses. He offered that no bureaucrat would or could spend money as wisely or as carefully as the taxpayers from whom it was taken. He spoke often of regulatory capture, the phenomenon where powerful special interests co-opt the very agencies designed to control them.



To Friedman, government policy is created and carried out through force, and that force creates unintended consequences that do not come from voluntary trade. The political power of government creates an incentive for the wealthy and devious to misuse it, helping to generate what Friedman dubbed "government failure."


  "Government failures can be as bad, or worse, than market failures."  

Friedman loved pointing out government failures in a way that proved his arguments about unintended consequences and the bad incentives of government policy.



He exposed how President Richard Nixon's wage and price controls led to gasoline shortages and higher unemployment. He railed against the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) and Federal Communications Commission (FCC) for creating de facto monopolies in transportation and media. Famously, he contended that the combination of public schooling, minimum wage laws, drug prohibition, and welfare programs had unintentionally forced many inner-city families into cycles of crime and poverty.




Did Friedman Say that Greed Is Good?
Friedman did not say that “greed is good”— that is a line from the 1987 movie “Wall Street”—but he did write a famous article in The New York Times in 1970: The Social Responsibility of Business is to Increase Profits. That article has been called the inspiration for the greed-is-good excesses of activist investors who push companies to create shareholder value at all costs—and to the exclusion of all other considerations, including investing in employees and delivering value to customers.




Was Friedman a Libertarian?
Walter Block said that Friedman called himself a small “l” libertarian, and he was clearly aligned with the libertarian principles of small, less intrusive government and deregulation throughout his career.




What Inspired Friedman to Become an Economist?
Friedman, who was born in 1912, said that the Great Depression was of one of the most important factors influencing his decision to become an economist. He wanted to investigate the causes and consequences of such widespread economic misery.


   The Bottom Line  

Friedman is widely considered the most influential economic and public policy thinker of the second half of the 20th century, just as Keynes is considered the most influential of the first half. One of Friedman’s most significant accomplishments was the extent to which his theories influenced government policy and public opinion as well as economic research.



Friedman's public policy theories are based on two core principles: 1) voluntary interactions between consumers and businesses often produce results superior to those crafted by government decree; 2) policies have unintended consequences, so economists should focus on results, not intentions.



Friedman’s use of monetarism to contradict Keynesian theories based on the Phillips curve is considered a major intellectual triumph by both critics and admirers. When the stagflation of the late 1970s proved the accuracy of his prediction that the historical correlation between inflation and unemployment would eventually break down, it was hailed as “one of the great triumphs of postwar economics.”
What Is Minimum Efficient Scale (MES)?  

The minimum efficient scale (MES) is the lowest point on a cost curve at which a company can produce its product at a competitive price. At the MES point, the company can achieve the economies of scale necessary for it to compete effectively in its industry.





Key Takeaways

The minimum efficient scale (MES) is the balance point at which a company can produce goods at a competitive price.Achieving MES minimizes long-run average total cost (LRATC).The MES is the point on a company's long-run average cost curve where economies of scale have been exhausted, and constant returns have begun.Many factors go into the MES, and each can change with time, forcing a reevaluation of overall costs.


   Understanding Minimum Efficient Scale  

For companies that produce goods, it is critical to find an optimal balance between consumer demand, production volume, and the costs associated with manufacturing and delivering goods.



A range of production costs go into establishing a minimum efficient scale, but its relationship to the size of its market—that is, the demand for the product—determines how many competitors can effectively operate in the market. In other words, MES seeks to identify the point at which a firm can produce its goods cheaply enough to offer them at a competitive price in the marketplace.



In economics, the MES is the lowest production point that will minimize the long-run average total cost (LRATC). LRATC represents the average cost per unit of output over the long run. But remember, all inputs are variable. MES allows a company to achieve the lowest cost per unit until constant returns to scale begin.

   Minimum Efficient Scale and Economies of Scale  

The minimum efficient scale (MES) is when the unit cost is at its lowest possible point while the company is producing its goods effectively. MES allows a company to compete more effectively since it can produce its goods efficiently at the minimum cost per unit. MES can be achieved through economies to scale.


  Economies of Scale  

Economies of scale are when a company lowers the per-unit cost of production while increasing production volume. As production volumes rise, the total costs are spread out over the increased number of units produced.



Economies of scale can increase a companies efficiency and profit. However, the lower costs can also allow a company to pass those savings onto their customers through lower prices, enhancing its competitive advantage. 


  Internal Economies of Scale  

Companies can achieve internal economies of scale by making improvements internally. For example, Henry Ford improved Ford's production capability by implementing a moving assembly line. The stages of the assembly process were divided up so that each worker would have a specific task.



Before the assembly line, one worker might complete all of the tasks, which was inefficient since it involved more skilled labor, increasing labor costs. Ford increased its production at a lower per-unit cost since it could hire unskilled labor to perform specific tasks.



A company's minimum efficient scale is the productivity level where its internal economies of scale create output that's as efficient and inexpensive as possible. The MES is the point on a company's long-run average cost curve where internal economies of scale have been exhausted, and constant returns have begun.


  External Economies of Scale  

Companies can also experience external economies of scale, which is when an outside force improves the scale for the entire industry, such as an industry tax break. For example, the government might pass a tax break for companies that purchase new equipment, benefitting all companies within the industry.


  Diseconomies of Scale  

During constant returns, the U-shaped curve remains flat (see earlier graph) until diseconomies of scale begin and costs rise without input. As companies get larger and grow more complex, they can experience higher costs and diseconomies of scale. This can occur when managing a larger company becomes challenging, leading to poor communication between employees and management, which increases the long-run average cost per unit.


   Example of Minimum Efficient Scale  

XYZ company is a producer and manufacturer of mobile devices and was looking to improve its production capacity to increase revenue while lowering its production costs.


  Internal Economies of Scale  

The company decided to purchase new equipment to replace the outdated technology and machinery. The newer technology improved the production volumes and speed at producing goods, reducing the long-run average cost per unit. Since the new equipment was more efficient, it used fewer input goods and raw materials in the production process.



Although the new technology required an outlay of cash, XYZ company achieved higher profits through internal economies to scale. The company could increase its sales since the new machinery could handle higher production volumes, and the lower input costs reduced the variable costs in producing the mobile devices.



Due to the increase in sales and production volumes, XYZ was able to buy the needed raw materials in bulk or greater quantities at a volume discount. Buying in bulk also reduced the long-run average cost per unit.


  Minimum Efficient Scale  

Eventually, minimum efficient scale kicked in, and the new technology didn't lower costs any further, even when production continued to rise. As a result, XYZ company achieved constant returns to scale, meaning the savings from internal economies to scale had been exhausted.


   Special Considerations  

When minimum efficient scale can be achieved with a small amount of production, many companies can operate efficiently and compete in an industry, such as restaurants. However, if it takes a high level of production output to achieve minimum efficient scale, fewer companies can operate in the industry, such as in the case of the telecommunications industry.



A healthy MES consists of numerous factors, but those factors are continually shifting. They have to be recalculated frequently to reflect the changes. A business also has to keep adjusting its production levels to keep hitting the mark.



When assessing the minimum efficient scale, it's important for a business to stay abreast of changes in external variables that could affect production. These can include the costs of labor, storage, and shipping; the costs of capital; the state of the competition; customer tastes and demands; and government regulations.
What Are Minimum Lease Payments?  

The minimum lease payment is the lowest amount that a lessor can expect to make (and a lessee can expect to pay) over the lifetime of the lease. Accountants calculate minimum lease payments in order to assign a present value to a lease in order to record the lease properly in the company's books.



The method of calculating minimum lease payments is laid out in the Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 13 (FAS 13), Accounting for Leases, which was published by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) in 1980.





Key Takeaways

Minimum lease payments refer to the lowest anticipated amount a lessee is expected to pay over the course of a leased asset or property.Present value calculations are utilized to discount future lease payments in order to properly account for the time value of money.Minimum lease payment estimates employ a 90% test for an asset's recovery of investment, regardless of whether it is a capital or operating lease.


   The Formula for Minimum Lease Payments and Lease Valuation  

The present value formula encompasses the minimum lease payments and the value of the total lease. Leased equipment often has a residual value at the end of the lease term, which is an estimate of the amount of value remaining in the leased asset.

   What Does Calculating Minimum Lease Payments Tell You?  

The minimum lease payment calculation is an important part of an accounting analysis called the recovery of investment test (90% test). This test is used to decide whether a lease should be recorded in the company's books as an operating or capital lease. The accounting treatment for minimum lease payments differs, depending on whether you're the lessee or the lessor.



When a company cannot afford to fully purchase equipment or expects it to have a short useful life, it may opt to lease the equipment. The lessor owns the equipment and rents it out. The lessee makes regularly scheduled payments to the lessor for the use of the equipment. The lessee is expected to make a minimum payment during the contractual period that the equipment is leased out. The minimum payment is known as the minimum lease payment.



Minimum lease payments are rental payments over the lease term including the amount of any bargain purchase option, premium, and any guaranteed residual value, and excluding any rental relating to costs to be met by the lessor and any contingent rentals.


   Special Considerations  

Although common sense suggests that the minimum lease payments on a 12-month lease at $1,000 a month should be $12,000, this number can be complicated by contractual clauses. Executory costs like maintenance and insurance are usually excluded because they are the responsibility of the lessor, but other factors can be added to the cost of a lease.



These include any guarantees made by the lessee to the lessor about the residual value of the leased property at the end of the lease as well as any payments for non-renewal of the lease. Once these are factored in, a reasonable present value can be assigned to the lease for accounting purposes.


   Example of Minimum Lease Payments and Present Value  

The value of a lease is estimated by discounting the minimum lease payments. Let’s use an example to determine how much a lease will cost in today’s dollars. A company takes out a 3-year lease on a number of heavy-duty trucks.



The minimum lease payment per month is $3,000 per month or $36,000 per year. Lessors also charge interest as compensation for leasing their equipment. In this case, the interest rate is 5% per year, or 5% divided by12 months = 0.417% per month.



To calculate the present value (PV) of the leased trucks, the residual value must be factored in. The residual value is the value of the trucks after the lease period is over. Let’s assume, in this case, that the residual value is $45,000.



The annual interest rate on the lease is used as the discount rate in calculating the PV. The PV on the trucks’ lease can be calculated using the PV formula, and including the residual in the calculation, as follows:

What Is a Minimum Monthly Payment?  

The minimum monthly payment is the lowest amount a customer can pay on their revolving credit account per month to remain in good standing with the credit card company. Making the monthly minimum payment on time is the least a consumer needs to do to avoid late fees and to have a good repayment history on their credit report. The amount of the minimum monthly payment is calculated as a small percentage of the consumer's total credit balance.





Key Takeaways

The minimum monthly payment is the least amount of money a borrower can pay on a revolving credit account each month and still remain in good standing with a credit card company.Consumers who pay only the minimum monthly payments will end up taking longer to pay off their balances and will pay higher interest expenses compared to consumers who pay more than the minimum.Revolving credit accounts allow consumers to keep the accounts open for life as long as they remain in good standing with no delinquencies.Non-revolving credit accounts pay a principal amount to the borrower at loan approval and require the borrower to repay the principal plus interest in a fixed payment schedule.Borrowers will use non-revolving accounts for large purchases, such as cars and real estate.


   Understanding Minimum Monthly Payment  

A minimum monthly payment is provided to customers monthly on revolving credit accounts. Revolving credit accounts differ from non-revolving credit accounts. Revolving credit accounts offer customers a low minimum monthly payment compared to a standardized payment schedule calculated for non-revolving credit.



All else being equal, consumers who only make the minimum monthly payment on their credit cards will incur higher interest expenses and take longer to pay off their balances than consumers who pay more than the minimum each month. The best option is always to pay credit card balances in full and on time because this strategy prevents the consumer from having to pay any interest or late fees. Paying off revolving credit balances monthly also allows customers to take greater advantage of cash back offers and rewards points earned on purchases.






Depending on your interest rate, you'll save an average of 10% to 29% per year in interest by increasing your credit card payments above the minimum monthly payment. 


   Revolving Credit Monthly Statements  

Revolving credit accounts are credit accounts that approve a borrower for a maximum level of borrowing at a specified interest rate which may be fixed or variable. Different from non-revolving credit, revolving credit accounts are open accounts that allow borrowers to keep variable credit balances without taking the full maximum principal.



Customers can keep revolving credit accounts open for life as long as they remain in good standing with the credit issuer. Since revolving credit accounts will have varying outstanding balances each month, credit companies provide borrowers with a monthly statement that details the activity on their account and a monthly minimum payment they must make to keep their account in good standing with no delinquencies.



Monthly revolving credit statements provide a variety of details for the account holder each month. Basic details include the month’s itemized transactions, the interest charged, fees charged, the previous month’s balance, the balance at the end of the statement period, and the minimum monthly payment that must be paid to keep the account current.





$124

The average minimum monthly payment on credit cards held by Americans in 2020 was approximately $124. This is based on average monthly balances at the time of $6,200 and a 2% minimum payment rate.


   Revolving vs. Non-Revolving Credit  

Revolving credit borrowers have the advantage of maintaining rolling balances over the life of the account. This allows them to take money from the account for purchases up to a maximum level at any time. By making monthly payments, a borrower pays down some of the outstanding balance with interest and therefore can continuously use the account for borrowing.



Non-revolving credit accounts differ from revolving credit accounts in that they pay out a principal amount to a borrower at the time of approval. Borrowers often use non-revolving credit for targeted purchases such as academic tuition, cars, and real estate.



Non-revolving credit accounts set a payment schedule for the borrower at the time of loan approval. The payment schedule is static and usually does not change over the life of the loan. With non-revolving credit, the borrower receives a one-time lump sum payout with a specified repayment period. The borrower must make monthly payments for the duration of the loan with the account being closed after full repayment has been made.
What Is Minimum Wage?  

A minimum wage is the lowest wage per hour that a worker may be paid, as mandated by federal law. It is a legally mandated price floor on hourly wages, below which nonexempt workers may not be offered a job or agree to work.





Key Takeaways

The minimum wage is a legally mandated base pay for nonexempt hourly workers.The federal minimum wage in the United States as of 2023 is $7.25 per hour.States and local municipalities can set their minimum-wage rates, but the state rate must be above the federal rate to qualify.


   Understanding Minimum Wage  

Minimum-wage laws were first introduced in Australia and New Zealand in an attempt to raise the income of unskilled workers. Most modern developed economies, as well as many developing economies, enforce a national minimum wage. Exceptions include Italy, Sweden, Norway, and Singapore.



The first minimum-wage law in the United States appeared in 1912 when Massachusetts set a minimum hourly rate for women and children under age 18.



In 1938, the federal government established a minimum wage of $0.25 under the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA). Adjusting for inflation, that wage is worth $5.31 as of May 2023.



As of 2022, the federal minimum wage rate in the United States is $7.25 per hour, unless the worker falls into a category specifically exempted from FLSA.



The government periodically assesses the federal minimum wage level with changes in inflation or the cost of living and the rate has not increased since July 2009. The Fair Minimum Wage Act of 2007 ordered the minimum wage to be raised from $5.15 in three increments, rising to $5.85, $6.55, and then finally to $7.25.






President Joe Biden campaigned to raise the federal minimum wage. As of Feb. 3, 2022, the minimum pay for government workers, except for U.S. Postal Service and Postal Regulatory Commission employees, increased to $15 per hour.


   History of the Minimum Wage  

The first minimum wage laws date to the late 1800s when sweatshop labor was common in newly industrialized countries. Minimum wages were a central demand for the new union movement, along with shorter hours and better working conditions.



The first national minimum wage was enacted by New Zealand in 1894, followed by the United Kingdom in 1909.



In the United States, minimum wages were advocated both by labor organizers and consumer groups, but they faced challenges from business interests. Several states attempted to pass minimum wage laws, but they were rebuffed by a 1923 Supreme Court decision that declared minimum wage laws to be unconstitutional.



It wasn't until the New Deal that congress finally enacted a federal minimum wage law. The Fair Labor Standards Act, passed in 1938, set the minimum wage at $0.25 per hour. Although it may seem low by today's standards, that wage provided a reasonably comfortable living for Depression-era families.


   Federal Minimum Wage vs. State Minimum Wages  

Even though the United States enforces a federal minimum wage, individual states, cities, and localities may pass different minimum-wage requirements as long as the stipulated hourly wage is not lower than the federal minimum wage. An employer who is subject to the federal and state minimum wage requirements must pay the higher of the two.



States usually set a minimum wage that is reflective of the cost of living in the region. For example, the state of Massachusetts has a minimum wage of $15 in 2023, while Montana has a minimum wage rate of $9.95.



As of 2023, minimum-wage rates exceeded the federal rate in 30 of the 50 states. At $16.50 per hour, the District of Columbia has the highest minimum wage. The second highest is $15.74, paid in Washington State; the third highest is $15.50, the minimum wage in California.






As of Jan. 1, 2023, only five states have not adopted a state minimum wage: Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi, South Carolina, and Tennessee.



The map below shows the minimum wage set at each state level. Some states have set their minimum wage higher than the federal minimum wage, others have matched the federal rate, and a select few don’t have a minimum-wage requirement. In the latter case, the federal minimum wage of $7.25 will apply.







Some states have special exceptions to their minimum wage rules:



Georgia and Wyoming both have a minimum wage of just $5.15. However, employees covered under the FLSA are subject to the federal minimum wage of $7.25.In Minnesota, small employers with annual sales of less than $500,000 pay a minimum wage of $8.42—rather than the regular state minimum of $10.33.In Nevada, the minimum wage is currently $1 less than the specified minimum if health benefits are included. As of Jul. 1, 2024, a $12 minimum wage for all employees will replace the current two-tier system, provided a measure on the Nov. 8, 2022, ballot passes. The measure is currently passing with 83% of the votes in.In Oklahoma, the minimum wage is $2 for employers with fewer than 10 full-time employees at any single location and employers with $100,000 or less in annual gross sales.





Fast Facts

Florida residents voted in November 2020 to increase the state’s minimum wage incrementally, beginning at $10 per hour on Sept. 30, 2021, until it reaches $15 per hour in September 2026.Similarly, in November 2022, residents of Nebraska passed legislation to raise the minimum wage in that state to $15 an hour in 2026, an increase of $6 over the current minimum wage of $9.


   State Minimum Wages vs. Municipal Minimum Wages  

In some cases, cities and municipalities within a state may set a higher minimum wage for residents who live within areas with higher costs of living. Within the state of Illinois, where the minimum wage is $13, the city of Chicago has a minimum wage of $15–$15.80, depending on employer size, enacted effective July 2023.


   Minimum-Wage Exceptions  

Certain categories of workers have often been exempt from being covered by minimum-wage laws.


  Tipped Workers  

Low-wage laborers in the United States can be exempt from the minimum wage if a sizable portion of their income is derived from tips. A lower minimum wage of $2.13 per hour may apply to tipped employees who regularly receive more than $30 in tips per month—or if the total tips retained in addition to the hourly wage rate are equal to or greater than the federal minimum wage. Where the employee’s total tips and hourly rate fall below the minimum wage, the employer is expected to compensate the employee for the shortfall.


  Students  

A full-time student working for a university, retail store, or service establishment cannot be paid less than 85% of the minimum wage. Although students may work up to eight hours per day, they cannot work more than 20 hours per week when school is in session. Students in a technical or vocational program cannot be paid less than 75% of the minimum wage throughout their active enrollment in the program.


  Employees Under 20 Years Old  

Workers under 20 years of age may be paid $4.25 per hour by federal law until they pass a three-month probationary period. After that, the employer must convert their pay structure to the federal minimum-wage rate.


  Workers With Physical or Mental Disabilities  

Workers with physical or mental disabilities can be paid less than the federal minimum wage, according to the FLSA. Disabilities that can affect production capacity include blindness, cerebral palsy, alcohol and drug addiction, mental illness, and developmental disabilities.


   The $15 Minimum Wage  

Minimum-wage laws were designed to end the exploitation of workforces and ensure that a country's working population does not fall below the poverty line. The Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) established the minimum wage affecting full-time and part-time workers in the private sector and federal, state, and local governments.



In 2022, debate surrounds the establishment of a $15 minimum wage. President Joe Biden’s American Rescue Plan attempted to raise it. However, the Biden administration only succeeded in raising the minimum hourly wage of government employees to $15.


  Arguments for a $15 Minimum Wage  

Proponents argue that an increase in the minimum wage helps meet the goal of a living wage, where employees earn enough income for a satisfactory standard of living.



They also claim a boost increases worker productivity, reduces income inequality, spurs economic growth, and improves employee retention.





$15 Per Hour

Many companies—among them Amazon, Target, Aldi, Chipotle, and CVS—have increased their hourly rate to $15 per hour, independent of a mandatory federal minimum-wage increase.


  Arguments Against a $15 Minimum Wage  

Critics argue that companies, not the government, should decide how much employees should be paid and that a minimum wage does not always boost the spending power of a population and can instead lead to higher unemployment.



A small change in the price for low-wage labor could have a large effect on employer demand, they say, leading to increasing unemployment among low-wage workers. Minimum-wage laws may also lead to job outsourcing, in which companies may decide to move their facilities to countries where labor costs are lower, critics note.


   Minimum Wage vs. Living Wage  

The minimum wage is sometimes contrasted with the living wage, an hourly salary that would allow someone to live comfortably if they are working full-time. While the minimum wage is established by law, a living wage is calculated based on factors such as average rents, cost of living, transportation, and childcare costs.



In fact, the federal minimum wage was much closer to a living wage when it was first established in 1938. The buying power of a minimum wage worker peaked in 1968, according to the Seattle Times. After that, inflation and price increases caused the real earnings of a minimum wage worker to fall, while productivity increased.




What Are Efficiency Wages?
Efficiency wages are the level of wages paid to workers above the minimum wage in order to retain a skilled and efficient workforce. Efficiency wage theory posits that an employer must pay its workers highly enough that workers are incentivized to be productive and that highly skilled workers do not quit. 




Which State Has the Lowest Minimum Wage?
Georgia and Wyoming both have a minimum wage of just $5.15. However, employers in these states subject to the Fair Labor Standards Act must pay their employees the $7.25 federal minimum wage. The same rules apply to the five states that have no minimum wage: Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi, South Carolina, and Tennessee.




Is the Minimum Wage Meant to Be a Living Wage?
A living wage is the minimum income deemed necessary for a worker to meet their basic needs. In 2023, the U.S. poverty level for a family of four was an income of $30,000, which equates to $14.42 per hour—well above the current minimum wage. Critics argue that the federal minimum wage, which has failed to keep up with the cost of living since the late 1960s, does not meet this criterion and fails to meet the living-wage standard.


   The Bottom Line  

The Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) is the federal law that established the minimum wage, which is $7.25 per hour in 2023. The government periodically assesses the federal minimum wage level. However, the rate has not increased since July 2009. Individual states, cities, and localities may pass different minimum wage requirements as long as the rate is higher than the federal minimum wage rate.
What Is Bitcoin Mining?  

Bitcoin mining is the process by which new bitcoins are entered into circulation. It is also the way the network confirms new transactions and is a critical component of the blockchain ledger's maintenance and development. "Mining" is performed using sophisticated hardware that solves an extremely complex computational math problem. The first computer to find the solution to the problem receives the next block of bitcoins and the process begins again.



Cryptocurrency mining is painstaking, costly, and only sporadically rewarding. Nonetheless, mining has a magnetic appeal for many investors who are interested in cryptocurrency because of the fact that miners receive rewards for their work with crypto tokens. This may be because entrepreneurial types see mining as pennies from heaven, like California gold prospectors in 1849. And if you are technologically inclined, why not do it?



The bitcoin reward that miners receive is an incentive that motivates people to assist in the primary purpose of mining: to legitimize and monitor Bitcoin transactions, ensuring their validity. Because many users all over the world share these responsibilities, Bitcoin is a "decentralized" cryptocurrency, or one that does not rely on any central authority like a central bank or government to oversee its regulation.



However, before you invest the time and equipment, read this explainer to see whether mining is really for you.





Key Takeaways

By mining, you can earn cryptocurrency without having to put down money for it.Bitcoin miners receive bitcoin as a reward for completing "blocks" of verified transactions, which are added to the blockchain.Mining rewards are paid to the miner who discovers a solution to a complex hashing puzzle first, and the probability that a participant will be the one to discover the solution is related to the portion of the network's total mining power.You need either a graphics processing unit (GPU) or an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) in order to set up a mining rig.






Throughout, we use "Bitcoin" with a capital "B" when referring to the network or the cryptocurrency as a concept, and "bitcoin" with a small "b" when we're referring to a quantity of individual tokens.


   Why Bitcoin Needs Miners  

Blockchain "mining" is a metaphor for the computational work that nodes in the network undertake in hopes of earning new tokens. In reality, miners are essentially getting paid for their work as auditors. They are doing the work of verifying the legitimacy of Bitcoin transactions. This convention is meant to keep Bitcoin users honest and was conceived by Bitcoin's founder, Satoshi Nakamoto. By verifying transactions, miners are helping to prevent the "double-spending problem." 



Double spending is a scenario in which a Bitcoin owner illicitly spends the same bitcoin twice. With physical currency, this isn't an issue: When you hand someone a $20 bill to buy a bottle of vodka, you no longer have it, so there's no danger you could use that same $20 bill to buy lotto tickets next door. Though counterfeit cash is possible, it is not exactly the same as literally spending the same dollar twice. With digital currency, however, as the Investopedia dictionary explains, "there is a risk that the holder could make a copy of the digital token and send it to a merchant or another party while retaining the original."



Let's say you had one legitimate $20 bill and one counterfeit of that same $20. If you were to try to spend both the real bill and the fake one, someone who took the trouble of looking at both of the bills' serial numbers would see that they were the same number, and thus one of them had to be false. What a blockchain miner does is analogous to that—they check transactions to make sure that users have not illegitimately tried to spend the same bitcoin twice. This isn't a perfect analogy—we'll explain in more detail below.






Only 1 megabyte of transaction data can fit into a single bitcoin block. The 1MB limit was set by Satoshi Nakamoto, and this has become a matter of controversy because some miners believe the block size should increase to accommodate more data, which would effectively mean that the Bitcoin network could process and verify transactions more quickly.


   Why Mine Bitcoin?  

In addition to lining the pockets of miners and supporting the Bitcoin ecosystem, mining serves another vital purpose: It is the only way to release new cryptocurrency into circulation. In other words, miners are basically "minting" currency. For example, as of March 2022, there were just under 19 million bitcoins in circulation, out of a total of 21 million.



Aside from the coins minted via the genesis block (the very first block, which founder Satoshi Nakamoto created), every single one of those bitcoins came into being because of miners. In the absence of miners, Bitcoin as a network would still exist and be usable, but there would never be any additional bitcoin. However, because the rate of bitcoin "mined" is reduced over time, the final bitcoin won't be circulated until around the year 2140. This does not mean that transactions will cease to be verified. Miners will continue to verify transactions and will be paid fees for doing so in order to keep the integrity of Bitcoin's network.



To earn new bitcoins, you need to be the first miner to arrive at the right answer, or closest answer, to a numeric problem. This process is also known as proof of work (PoW). To begin mining is to start engaging in this proof-of-work activity to find the answer to the puzzle.



No advanced math or computation is really involved. You may have heard that miners are solving difficult mathematical problems—that's true but not because the math itself is hard. What they're actually doing is trying to be the first miner to come up with a 64-digit hexadecimal number (a "hash") that is less than or equal to the target hash. It's basically guesswork.



So it is a matter of randomness, but with the total number of possible guesses for each of these problems numbering in the trillions, it's incredibly arduous work. And the number of possible solutions (referred to as the level of mining difficulty) only increases with each miner that joins the mining network. In order to solve a problem first, miners need a lot of computing power. To mine successfully, you need to have a high "hash rate," which is measured in terms gigahashes per second (GH/s) and terahashes per second (TH/s).



Aside from the short-term payoff of newly minted bitcoins, being a coin miner can also give you "voting" power when changes are proposed in the Bitcoin network protocol. This is known as a Bitcoin Improvement Protocol (BIP). In other words, miners have some degree of influence on the decision-making process for matters such as forking. The more hash power you possess, the more votes you have to cast for such initiatives.


   How Much a Miner Earns  

The rewards for Bitcoin mining are reduced by half roughly every four years. When bitcoin was first mined in 2009, mining one block would earn you 50 BTC. In 2012, this was halved to 25 BTC. By 2016, this was halved again to 12.5 BTC. On May 11, 2020, the reward halved again to 6.25 BTC.

As of March 2022, the price of Bitcoin was around $39,000 per bitcoin, which means you'd have earned $243,750 (6.25 x 39,000) for completing a block. Not a bad incentive to solve that complex hash problem detailed above, it might seem.



To keep track of precisely when these halvings will occur, you can consult the Bitcoin Clock, which updates this information in real time. Interestingly, the market price of Bitcoin has, throughout its history, tended to correspond closely to the reduction of new coins entered into circulation. This lowering inflation rate increased scarcity and, historically, the price has risen with it.






If you want to estimate how much bitcoin you could mine with your mining rig's hash rate, the site CryptoCompare offers a helpful calculator. Other web resources offer similar tools.


   What You Need to Mine Bitcoins  

Although individuals were able to compete for blocks with a regular at-home personal computer early on in Bitcoin's history, this is no longer the case. The reason for this is that the difficulty of mining Bitcoin changes over time.



In order to ensure the blockchain functions smoothly and can process and verify transactions, the Bitcoin network aims to have one block produced every 10 minutes or so. However, if there are 1 million mining rigs competing to solve the hash problem, they'll likely reach a solution faster than a scenario in which 10 mining rigs are working on the same problem. For that reason, Bitcoin is designed to evaluate and adjust the difficulty of mining every 2,016 blocks, or roughly every two weeks.



When there is more computing power collectively working to mine for bitcoins, the difficulty level of mining increases in order to keep block production at a stable rate. Less computing power means the difficulty level decreases. At today's network size, a personal computer mining for bitcoin will almost certainly find nothing.


  Mining hardware  

All of this is to say that, in order to mine competitively, miners must now invest in powerful computer equipment like a graphics processing unit (GPU) or, more realistically, an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC). These can run from $500 into the tens of thousands of dollars. Some miners—particularly Ethereum miners—buy individual graphics cards as a low-cost way to cobble together mining operations.



Today, Bitcoin mining hardware is almost entirely made up of ASIC machines, which in this case, specifically do one thing and one thing only: Mine for bitcoins. Today's ASICs are many orders of magnitude more powerful than CPUs or GPUs and gain both more hashing power and energy efficiency every few months as new chips are developed and deployed. Today's miners can produce almost 200 TH/s at only 27.5 joules per terahash.


  An analogy  

Say I tell three friends that I'm thinking of a number between one and 100, and I write that number on a piece of paper and seal it in an envelope. My friends don't have to guess the exact number; they just have to be the first person to guess any number that is less than or equal to it. And there is no limit to how many guesses they get.



Let's say I'm thinking of the number 19. If Friend A guesses 21, they lose because 21 > 19. If Friend B guesses 16 and Friend C guesses 12, then they've both theoretically arrived at viable answers because of 16 < 19 and 12 < 19. There is no "extra credit" for Friend B, even though B's answer was closer to the target answer of 19. Now imagine that I pose the "guess what number I'm thinking of" question, but I'm not asking just three friends, and I'm not thinking of a number between 1 and 100. Rather, I'm asking millions of would-be miners, and I'm thinking of a 64-digit hexadecimal number. Now you see that it's going to be extremely hard to guess the right answer. If B and C both answer simultaneously, then the system breaks down.



In Bitcoin terms, simultaneous answers occur frequently, but at the end of the day, there can only be one winning answer. When multiple simultaneous answers are presented that are equal to or less than the target number, the Bitcoin network will decide by a simple majority—51%—which miner to honor.



Typically, it is the miner who has done the most work or, in other words, the one that verifies the most transactions. The losing block then becomes an "orphan block." Orphan blocks are those that are not added to the blockchain. Miners who successfully solve the hash problem but haven't verified the most transactions are not rewarded with bitcoin.


   The Mining Process  
  What Is a '64-Digit Hexadecimal Number'?  

Here is an example of such a number: 



0000000000000000057fcc708cf0130d95e27c5819203e9f967ac56e4df598ee



The number above has 64 digits. Easy enough to understand so far. As you probably noticed, that number consists not just of numbers, but also letters of the alphabet. Why is that?



To understand what these letters are doing in the middle of numbers, let's unpack the word "hexadecimal."



The decimal system uses factors of 100 as its base (e.g., 1% = 0.01). This, in turn, means that every digit of a multi-digit number has 100 possibilities, zero through 99. In computing, the decimal system is simplified to base 10, or zero through nine.



"Hexadecimal," on the other hand, means base 16 because "hex" is derived from the Greek word for six, and "deca" is derived from the Greek word for 10. In a hexadecimal system, each digit has 16 possibilities. But our numeric system only offers 10 ways of representing numbers (zero through nine). That's why you have to add letters, specifically, letters A, B, C, D, E, and F. 



If you are mining Bitcoin, you do not need to calculate the total value of that 64-digit number (the hash). I repeat: You do not need to calculate the total value of a hash.

  What do '64-digit hexadecimal numbers' have to do with Bitcoin mining?   

Remember that analogy, in which the number 19 was written on a piece of paper and put in a sealed envelope? In Bitcoin mining terms, that metaphorical undisclosed number in the envelope is called the target hash.



What miners are doing with those huge computers and dozens of cooling fans is guessing at the target hash. Miners make these guesses by randomly generating as many "nonces" as possible, as quickly as possible. A nonce is short for "number only used once," and the nonce is the key to generating these 64-bit hexadecimal numbers I keep mentioning. In Bitcoin mining, a nonce is 32 bits in size—much smaller than the hash, which is 256 bits. The first miner whose nonce generates a hash that is less than or equal to the target hash is awarded credit for completing that block and is awarded the spoils of 6.25 BTC.



In theory, you could achieve the same goal by rolling a 16-sided die 64 times to arrive at random numbers, but why on Earth would you want to do that?



The screenshot below, taken from the site Blockchain.info, might help you put all this information together at a glance. You are looking at a summary of everything that happened when block No.490163 was mined. The nonce that generated the "winning" hash was 731511405. The target hash is shown on top. The term "Relayed by AntPool" refers to the fact that this particular block was completed by AntPool, one of the more successful mining pools (more about mining pools below).



As you see here, their contribution to the Bitcoin community is that they confirmed 1,768 transactions for this block. If you really want to see all 1,768 of those transactions for this block, go to this page and scroll down to the Transactions section.

  How do I guess at the target hash?  

All target hashes begin with a string of leading zeroes. There is no minimum target, but there is a maximum target set by the Bitcoin Protocol. No target can be greater than this number:



00000000ffff0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000



The winning hash for a bitcoin miner is one that has at least the minimum number of leading zeroes defined by the mining difficulty.



Here are some examples of randomized hashes and the criteria for whether they will lead to success for the miner:

To find such a hash value, you have to get a fast mining rig, or, more realistically, join a mining pool—a group of coin miners who combine their computing power and split the mined Bitcoin. Mining pools are comparable to Powerball clubs whose members buy lottery tickets en masse and agree to share any winnings. A disproportionately large number of blocks are mined by pools rather than by individual miners.



In other words, it's literally just a numbers game. You cannot guess the pattern or make a prediction based on previous target hashes. At today's difficulty levels, the odds of finding the winning value for a single hash is one in the tens of trillions. Not great odds if you're working on your own, even with a tremendously powerful mining rig.



Not only do miners have to factor in the costs associated with expensive equipment necessary to stand a chance of solving a hash problem, but they must also consider the significant amount of electrical power mining rigs utilize in generating vast quantities of nonces in search of the solution. All told, Bitcoin mining is largely unprofitable for most individual miners as of this writing. The site CryptoCompare offers a helpful calculator that allows you to plug in numbers such as your hash speed and electricity costs to estimate the costs and benefits.

   What Are Mining Pools?  

The miner who discovers a solution to the puzzle first receives the mining rewards, and the probability that a participant will be the one to discover the solution is equal to the proportion of the total mining power on the network. 



Participants with a small percentage of the mining power stand a very small chance of discovering the next block on their own. For instance, a mining card that one could purchase for a couple of thousand dollars would represent less than 0.001% of the network's mining power. With such a small chance at finding the next block, it could be a long time before that miner finds a block, and the difficulty going up makes things even worse. The miner may never recoup their investment. The answer to this problem is mining pools. 



Mining pools are operated by third parties and coordinate groups of miners. By working together in a pool and sharing the payouts among all participants, miners can get a steady flow of bitcoin starting the day they activate their miners. Statistics on some of the mining pools can be seen on Blockchain.info.


   A Pickaxe Strategy for Bitcoin Mining  

As mentioned above, the easiest way to acquire Bitcoin is to simply buy it on one of the many Bitcoin exchanges. Alternately, you can always leverage the "pickaxe strategy." This is based on the old saw that during the 1849 California Gold Rush, the smart investment was not to pan for gold, but rather to make the pickaxes used for mining.



To put it in modern terms, invest in the companies that manufacture those pickaxes. In a cryptocurrency context, the pickaxe equivalent would be a company that manufactures equipment used for Bitcoin mining. You may consider looking into companies that make ASIC equipment or GPUs instead, for example.


   Downsides of Mining   

The risks of mining are often financial and regulatory. As aforementioned, Bitcoin mining, and mining in general, is a financial risk because one could go through all the effort of purchasing hundreds or thousands of dollars worth of mining equipment only to have no return on their investment. That said, this risk can be mitigated by joining mining pools. If you are considering mining and live in an area where it is prohibited, you should reconsider. It may also be a good idea to research your country's regulation and overall sentiment toward cryptocurrency before investing in mining equipment.



One additional potential risk from the growth of Bitcoin mining (and other PoW systems as well) is the increasing energy usage required by the computer systems running the mining algorithms. Though microchip efficiency has increased dramatically for ASIC chips, the growth of the network itself is outpacing technological progress. As a result, there are concerns about Bitcoin mining's environmental impact and carbon footprint.







There are, however, efforts to mitigate this negative externality by seeking cleaner and green energy sources for mining operations (such as geothermal or solar sources), as well as utilizing carbon offset credits. Switching to less energy-intensive consensus mechanisms like proof-of-stake (PoS), which Ethereum has transitioned to, is another strategy; however, PoS comes with its own set of drawbacks and inefficiencies, such as incentivizing hoarding instead of using coins and a risk of centralization of consensus control.






Mining is a metaphor for introducing new bitcoins into the system because it requires (computational) work just as mining for gold or silver requires (physical) effort. Of course, the tokens that miners find are virtual and exist only within the digital ledger of the Bitcoin blockchain.




Why Do Bitcoins Need to Be Mined?
Because they are entirely digital records, there is a risk of copying, counterfeiting, or double-spending the same coin more than once. Mining solves these problems by making it extremely expensive and resource-intensive to try to do one of these things or otherwise "hack" the network. Indeed, it is far more cost-effective to join the network as a miner than to try to undermine it.




How Does Mining Confirm Transactions?
In addition to introducing new BTC into circulation, mining serves the crucial role of confirming and validating new transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain. This is important because there is no central authority such as a bank, court, government, or anything else determining which transactions are valid and which are not. Instead, the mining process achieves a decentralized consensus through proof of work (PoW).




Why Does Mining Use So Much Electricity?
In the early days of Bitcoin, anybody could simply run a mining program from their PC or laptop. But as the network got larger and more people became interested in mining, the mining algorithm became more difficult. This is because the code for Bitcoin targets finding a new block once every 10 minutes, on average. If more miners are involved, the chances that somebody will solve the right hash quicker increases, and so the difficulty increases to restore that 10-minute goal. Now imagine if thousands, or even millions more times that mining power joins the network. That's a lot of new machines consuming energy.




Is Bitcoin Mining Legal?
The legality of Bitcoin mining depends entirely on your geographic location. The concept of Bitcoin can threaten the dominance of fiat currencies and government control over the financial markets. For this reason, Bitcoin is completely illegal in certain places.Bitcoin ownership and mining are legal in more countries than not. Some examples of places where it was illegal according to a 2018 report were Algeria, Egypt, Morocco, Bolivia, Ecuador, Nepal, and Pakistan. Since 2018, other countries have banned Bitcoin mining including Bangladesh, China, Dominican Republic, North Macedonia, Qatar, and Vietnam. Overall, Bitcoin use and mining remain legal across much of the globe.




Does Crypto Mining Damage Your GPU/Computer?
Because blockchain mining is very resource-intensive, it can put a large strain on your GPU or other mining hardware. In fact, it is not unheard of for GPUs to blow out, or for mining rigs to burst into flames. However, keeping your rigs running at a moderate pace and with sufficient power supplied, it is generally safe.




Can You Mine Bitcoin on Your iPhone?
No. Bitcoin mining today requires vast amounts of computing power and electricity to be competitive. Running a miner on a mobile device, even if it is part of a mining pool, will likely result in no earnings.


   The Bottom Line  

Bitcoin "mining" serves a crucial function to validate and confirm new transactions to the blockchain and to prevent double-spending by bad actors. It is also the way that new bitcoins are introduced into the system. Based on a complex puzzle, the task involves producing proof of work (PoW), which is inherently energy-intensive. This energy, however, is embodied in the value of bitcoins and the Bitcoin system and keeps this decentralized system stable, secure, and trustworthy.
What Is a Minority Interest?  

A minority interest refers to a stake in a company that is otherwise controlled by a parent company. This usually occurs in subsidiaries where the parent company owns more than 50% of the voting shares. Minority interests generally come with some rights for the stakeholder such as participation in sales and certain audit rights.



Minority interests are also referred to as non-controlling interests. Under U.S. GAAP, non-controlling interests are listed on the equity section of the parent company's consolidated balance sheet, but separate from the parent company's equity. This represents the proportion of the subsidiary owned by minority shareholders.





Key Takeaways

A minority interest is a stake in a company that is controlled by a larger parent company.Minority interests generally range between 20% and 30% of the company's equity, compared to the majority interest of over 50%.The term "non-controlling interest" is used as a synonym for minority interest, but also reflects situations where a controlling entity might not have majority ownership.Parent companies will list the minority interests in their subsidiaries in the equity section of their consolidated balance sheet.Although minority interests cannot outvote the parent company, they do have some rights, such as audit rights.

   Understanding Minority Interests  

Minority interests usually refer to the portion of a company or stock not held by the parent company, which holds the majority interest. Most minority interests range between 20% and 30%.



While the majority stakeholder—in most cases, the parent company—has voting rights to set policy and procedures, the minority stakeholders generally have very little say or influence in the direction of the company. That's why they are also referred to as non-controlling interests (NCIs).



In some cases, a minority may have some rights such as the ability to take part in sales. There are laws that also entitle minority interest holders to certain audit rights. They also may be able to attend shareholder or partnership meetings.



In the world of private equity, companies and investors with a minority interest may be able to negotiate control rights. For example, venture capitalists may ask to negotiate for a seat on the board of directors in exchange for their investment in a startup.



In the corporate world, a corporation lists minority ownership on its balance sheet. In addition to being reflected on the balance sheet, minority interest is reported on the consolidated income statement as a share of profit belonging to minority equity holders.






The consolidated income statement must have a clear distinction between the net income from the parent company and that of the minority interest.


   Example of Minority Interest  

ABC Corporation owns 90% of XYZ Inc., which is a $100 million company. In its consolidated balance sheet, ABC will record its $90 million shares in XYZ, as well as the $10 million non-controlling interest to represent the shares of XYZ that ABC does not own.



XYZ Inc. generates $10 million in net income. As a result, ABC recognizes $1 million—or 10% of $10 million—of net income attributable to minority interest on its income statement. Correspondingly, ABC marks up the $10 million minority interest by $1 million on the balance sheet. The minority interest investors do not record anything unless they receive dividends, which are booked as income.






In 2007, the Financial Accounting Standards Board introduced the phrase "non-controlling interest" as a synonym for minority interest. Although they mean the same thing, the new phrase reflects the fact that there are situations where a non-majority shareholder can still act as a controlling interest.


   Types of Minority Interests  

A minority interest can either be passive or active. Passive minority interests are those where a minority shareholder owns less than 20% of the equity in a subsidiary company, giving them no material influence on the company's decisions. 



In accounting terms, only the dividends received from the minority interest are recorded for those with minority passive interests. This is referred to as the cost method—the ownership stake is treated as an investment at cost, and any dividends received are treated as dividend income.



Active minority interests—owning 21% to 49%—are when a minority shareholder can materially influence the company where it holds a minority interest. Unlike passive interests, dividends received and a percentage of income are recorded for those with active minority interests. This is referred to as the equity method.



Dividends are treated as a return on capital, decreasing the value of the investment on the balance sheet. The percentage of income attributable to the minority interest is added to the investment account on the balance sheet as this effectively increases its equity share in the company.


   Special Considerations  

The most common examples of minority interests occur in subsidiaries where a parent company holds over 50% of voting shares. However, it is also possible for a parent company to exert a controlling interest without a majority stake. This may be the case with variable interest entities that exert control through a contractual obligation rather than ownership.



Regardless of the type of control, a parent company consolidates the financial results of the subsidiary with its own. As a result, a proportional share of income shows up on the parent company's income statement attributable to the minority interest. Likewise, a proportional share of equity in the subsidiary company shows up on the parent's balance sheet attributable to the minority interest.



Prior to 2008, minority interest could be reported as either equity or a noncurrent liability under the rules of U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). This ambiguity was later eliminated by a requirement to report minority interests with the parent company's equity. The International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) also require that minority interest must be recorded in the equity section of the balance sheet.
What Is a Minsky Moment?  

Minsky Moment refers to the onset of a market collapse brought on by the reckless speculative activity that defines an unsustainable bullish period. Minsky Moment is named after economist Hyman Minsky and defines the point in time where the sudden decline in market sentiment inevitably leads to a market crash.





Key Takeaways

Minsky Moment refers to the onset of a market collapse brought on by the reckless speculative activity that defines an unsustainable bullish period.Minsky Moment crises generally occur because investors, engaging in excessively aggressive speculation, take on additional credit risk during bull markets.Minsky Moment defines the tipping point when speculative activity reaches an extreme that is unsustainable, leading to rapid price deflation and unpreventable market collapse.


   Understanding Minsky Moment  

A Minsky Moment is based on the idea that periods of bullish speculation, if they last long enough, will eventually lead to crisis, and the longer the speculation occurs, the more severe the crisis will be. Hyman Minsky's main claim to economic theory fame was centered around the concept of the inherent instability of markets, especially bull markets. He felt that extended bull markets always end in epic collapses.



Minsky postulated that an abnormally long bullish economic growth cycle will spur an asymmetric rise in market speculation that will, eventually, result in market instability and collapse. A Minsky Moment crisis follows a prolonged period of bullish speculation, which is also associated with high amounts of debt taken on by both retail and institutional investors.



The term Minsky Moment was coined in 1998 by Paul McCulley, of PIMCO fame while referring to the Asian Debt Crisis of 1997. A dissection of the causes that led to this crisis put the preponderance of blame on speculators putting increasing pressure on dollar-pegged Asian currencies until they eventually collapsed.



Perhaps the most famous, or at least the most recent, crisis that brought Minsky Moment to the forefront, if for no other reason than as an example of the dangers of profligacy, was the 2008 financial crisis, also called the Great Recession. During the height of this crisis, a wide range of markets reached all-time lows, triggering a wave of margin calls, a massive selloff in assets to cover debts, and higher default rates.


   Minsky Moment Catalysts and Effects  

Minsky Moment crises generally occur because investors, engaging in excessively aggressive speculation, take on additional credit risk during prosperous times, or bull markets. The longer a bull market lasts, the more investors borrow to try and capitalize on market moves. Minsky Moment defines the tipping point when speculative activity reaches an extreme that is unsustainable, leading to rapid price deflation and unpreventable market collapse. What follows, as hypothesized by Hyman Minsky, is a prolonged period of instability.



As a hypothetical example, consider a market in the throes of a bullish surge that sees investors borrowing funds aggressively, often to the limits of their capabilities, to participate in the economic boom. If the market retraces slightly, which is normal market behavior, the valuations of their leveraged assets could decrease to the point where they might not cover the debts taken to acquire them. Lenders start calling in their loans. Speculative assets are hard to sell, so investors are forced to sell less speculative ones to satisfy the lender's demands. The sale of these investments causes an overall decline in the market. At this point, the market is in a Minsky Moment. The demand for liquidity might even force the country's central bank to intervene.


   Is Another Minsky Moment Looming?  

In 2017, several experts issued warnings of an approaching Minsky Moment in China as debt levels increased while equity market valuations maintained their bullish trend. The Chinese government has also issued warnings to investors of an impending Minsky Moment if debt levels continue to rise.



Meanwhile, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) joined the chorus in issuing global warnings of high debt levels that had the potential to result in Minsky Moment crises around the world. While this has not come to fruition yet, the warning signs are there. The U.S. has been experiencing an extended period of economic prosperity, debt levels are rising, and speculative activity is robust, although it does not appear to have reached the extreme levels that presage a Minsky Moment.
What Is the Misery Index?  

The misery index is a measure of economic distress felt by everyday people, due to the risk of (or actual) joblessness combined with an increasing cost of living. The misery index is calculated by adding the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate to the inflation rate.



Since unemployment and inflation are both considered detrimental to one's economic well-being, their combined value is useful as an indicator of overall economic health. The original misery index was popularized in the 1970s with the development of stagflation, or simultaneously high inflation and unemployment.





Key Takeaways

The first misery index was created by Arthur Okun in the 1970s to provide a snapshot of the U.S. economy.The misery index equals the inflation rate and unemployment rate; the higher the index, the greater the misery felt by average citizens.It has broadened in recent times to include other economic indicators, such as bank lending rates.The misery index is considered a convenient but imprecise metric.Variations of the original misery index have become popular as ways to gauge the overall health of a national economy.


   Understanding the Misery Index  

The misery index has two components. They are the unemployment rate and the inflation rate. U.S. unemployment is the number of able-bodied adults who are actively looking for work, as a percentage of the total workforce.



Inflation refers to the rate at which money loses buying power, due to the rise of consumer prices. In most cases, these numbers are inversely correlated; when the unemployment rate goes down, prices tend to go up, and vice versa.



The misery index is calculated by adding the seasonally adjusted rate of unemployment and the annual inflation rate.



Misery index = Seasonally Adjusted Rate of Unemployment + Annual Inflation Rate



Economists generally consider full employment to mean an unemployment rate of 4%–5%. The Federal Reserve (Fed) targets an inflation rate of 2%. Therefore, a satisfactory misery index rating would be in the range of 6%–7%.


   Components of the Misery Index  
  Seasonally Adjusted Rate of Unemployment   

The unemployment rate is adjusted to remove seasonal employment patterns so that it can provide good insight into the relative level of employment.



The seasonally adjusted unemployment rate is measured as a percentage. It reflects the portion of the workforce that is able to work and seek employment actively, but can’t find a job. Workers who are retired but working and those who have stopped trying to find a job are excluded from the seasonally adjusted rate.



The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) reports unemployment data each month.


  Annual Inflation Rate  

The annual inflation rate is the percentage increase in the prices of the goods and services consumed by the buyers. In short, it measures the prices of all goods and services existing in the economy.



The BLS reports inflation data each month in its consumer price index (CPI) release.





Misery Index as of December 2022

Misery Index = 9.95Unemployment rate (3.5) + Inflation rate (6.45)


   History of the Misery Index  
  Arthur Okun's Concept  

The first misery index was created by economist Arthur Okun in the 1970s when he was a scholar at the Brookings Institution. He had previously served on President Lyndon Johnson's Council of Economic Advisers.



Okun combined the nation’s annual inflation rate and unemployment rate to provide an easily understood snapshot of the economy’s relative health. The higher the index, the greater the misery felt by the average citizen.


  Period of Stagflation  

During the 1970s, after President Nixon restricted and then severed the final links between the U.S. dollar and gold, the U.S. experienced several years of simultaneously elevated price inflation and unemployment, known as stagflation.



The American people were caught in a squeeze between the hardships of joblessness as the economy hit a series of recessions and a rising cost of living as the dollar rapidly lost value.



This phenomenon did not fit with dominant macroeconomic theories at the time, based on the Phillips curve. It led economists to explore alternative ideas to describe and explain what was going on.



At the time, the misery index was novel because mainstream economists had previously believed that inflation and unemployment would offset one another rather than rise at the same time.


  Use in Presidential Campaigns  

During the 1976 campaign for U.S. president, candidate Jimmy Carter popularized Okun’s misery index as a means of criticizing his opponent, incumbent Gerald Ford. By the end of Ford administration, the misery index was a relatively high 12.7%.



During the 1980 presidential campaign, Ronald Reagan in turn pointed out that the misery index had increased under Carter.


   Limitations of the Misery Index  

While it is a convenient shorthand for economic misfortune, the misery index should not be considered a precise metric for economic health.



For one thing, both components of the misery index have inherent blind spots. The unemployment rate only counts the unemployed who are actively looking for work. It does not include those who have given up looking for work, as might be the case for long-term stretches of unemployment.



Likewise, low inflation can also be accompanied by unexpected misery. For example, no inflation, or even deflation, can be signs of a stagnant economy, which can be a hardship for many due to the potential for rising unemployment and falling equity and real estate valuations. However, the low rates would produce a very low misery index.



In addition, the misery index treats unemployment and inflation equally. However, a 1% increase in unemployment likely causes more misery than a 1% increase in inflation.





Warning

The Okun misery index is considered a convenient but highly imprecise metric, due to the inherent flaws of inflation and unemployment as measurements of economic health.


   Criticisms of the Misery Index  

The Okun misery index has faced some criticism from economists.



It doesn't include some key factors. Some believe it is not a good indicator of economic performance because it doesn't include economic growth data. However, this mistakes the misery index for a measure of general economic performance rather than for a measure of the pain felt by the average citizen.
It only considers current data. As a measure of personal economic distress, the misery index may underweight the role of expectations and uncertainty by looking only at current unemployment and inflation rates. Much of the stress and worry that people actually feel may be for their future economic prospects (in addition to current conditions). In particular, the unemployment rate is generally considered to be a lagging indicator that likely understates perceived misery early in a recession and overstates it even after the recession is over.
It's used inconsistently. During the Great Moderation, the prevalence of low unemployment and low inflation figures across much of the world meant that the misery index was used only from time to time, during brief recessions and crises. Bad news sells, so periods of simultaneously low inflation and unemployment simply don't generate the same impetus to measure and track economic misery.






There have been several attempts to modernize the misery index by including other metrics.


   Newer Versions of the Misery Index  
  By Robert Barro  

The misery index has been modified several times, first by Harvard economist Robert Barro. In 1999, Barro created the Barro misery index, which adds consumer lending interest rates and the gap between actual and potential gross domestic product (GDP) growth to evaluate post-WWII presidents.


  By Steve Hanke  

In 2011, Johns Hopkins economist Steve Hanke modified Barro's misery index and broadened its application to be a cross-country index. Hanke's annual misery index is the sum of unemployment, inflation, and bank lending rates, minus the change in real GDP per capita.



Hanke publishes his global list of misery index rankings annually for the countries that report relevant data on a timely basis. For 2021, his list included 156 nations, with Libya being identified as the world’s least miserable country and Cuba as the world's most miserable country.


  By Tom Lee  

The concept of a misery index has also been expanded to asset classes. For example, Tom Lee, co-founder of Fundstrat Advisors, created the Bitcoin Misery Index (BMI) to measure the average bitcoin investor's misery. The index calculates the percentage of winning trades against total trades and adds it to the cryptocurrency's overall volatility. The index is considered "at misery" when its total value is less than 27.


  By Bloomberg  

A variation of the original misery index is the Bloomberg misery index. Argentina, South Africa, and Venezuela, countries beset by widespread inflation and unemployment, topped the index in 2020.



On the other end, Thailand, Singapore, and Japan were considered the happiest countries according to economist estimates.



But low inflation and low unemployment rates can also mask low demand. Japan is a textbook case of persistently low demand due to an economy that has suffered from stagflation for the last two decades.






It's smart for investors to build an emergency fund in case of an economic downturn or job loss.


   Misery Index Under Different Presidents  

Although the misery index was first popularized in the 1970s, it is possible to evaluate the economic misfortunes under different presidents by comparing their inflation and unemployment figures.



Unsurprisingly, the most miserable year on record occurred during the Great Depression. The misery index reached 25.7% in the first year of Franklin Roosevelt's presidency (1933). It fell to 3.5% by 1944, likely due to full employment during the Second World War.



Richard Nixon (1969–1974) and Jimmy Carter (1977–1980) have the unenviable distinction of presiding over the most miserable economies of the post-war period. The misery index rose to 20% under Nixon and 22% under Carter. The index fell sharply under Ronald Reagan, and it continued to trend downwards during the George H.W. Bush and Clinton presidencies.



During the presidency of George W. Bush, the misery index again trended upwards. It reached a peak of 12.7% under President Obama due to the ongoing Great Recession. The index fell to a low of 5.06% in 2015 and remained low through most of the Trump presidency (2017–2020). However, the COVID-19 pandemic caused a sharp increase in unemployment, pushing the misery index to 15%.

What Is a Recent Misery Index?
The Misery Index as of December 2022 is 9.95 (Unemployment rate of 3.5 + Inflation rate of 6.45).




Who Created the Misery Index?
The Misery Index was created by economist Arthur Okun in the 1970s and it was initially called the Economic Discomfort Index.




What's the Most Miserable Country in the World?
According to the Misery Index for 2021, Cuba was the most miserable country in the world with a misery index score of 1,227.6, followed by Venezuela (774.3) and Sudan (397.2).


   The Bottom Line  

The misery index, created by economist Arthur Okun, is an economic indicator that is calculated by adding the seasonally adjusted rate of unemployment and the annual inflation rate. Broadly speaking, it serves as a measure of the nation's economic health and the economic distress of the average citizen.



While the misery index became a popular measure due to its simplicity, it is widely regarded as an ineffective measure of macroeconomic conditions since it doesn't consider economic growth data.
What Is a Misrepresentation?  

A misrepresentation is a false statement of a material fact made by one party which affects the other party's decision in agreeing to a contract.



If the misrepresentation is discovered, the contract can be declared void. Depending on the situation, the adversely impacted party may seek damages. In this type of contract dispute, the party that is accused of making the misrepresentation is the defendant, and the party making the claim is the plaintiff.





Key Takeaways

Misrepresentations are false statements of truth that affect another party's decision related to a contract.Such false statements can void a contract and in some cases, allow the other party to seek damages.Misrepresentation is a basis of contract breach in transactions, no matter the size, but applies only to statements of fact, not to opinions or predictions.There are three types of misrepresentations—innocent misrepresentation, negligent misrepresentation, and fraudulent misrepresentation—all of which have varying remedies.


   How Misrepresentation Works  

Misrepresentation applies only to statements of fact, not to opinions or predictions. Misrepresentation is a basis for contract breach in transactions, no matter the size.



A seller of a car in a private transaction could misrepresent the number of miles to a prospective buyer, which could cause the person to purchase the car. If the buyer later finds out that the car had much more wear and tear than represented, they can file a suit against the seller.



In higher stakes situations, a misrepresentation can be considered an event of default by a lender, for instance, in a credit agreement. Meanwhile, misrepresentations can be grounds for termination of a mergers and acquisitions (M&A) deal, in which case a substantial break fee could apply.






   Special Considerations  

In some situations, such as where a fiduciary relationship is involved, misrepresentation can occur by omission. That is, misrepresentation may occur when a fiduciary fails to disclose material facts of which they have knowledge.



A duty also exists to correct any statements of fact that later become known to be untrue. In this case, the failure to correct a previous false statement would be a misrepresentation.


   Types of Misrepresentations  

There are three types of misrepresentations.



Innocent misrepresentation is a false statement of material fact by the defendant, who was unaware at the time of contract signing that the statement was untrue. The remedy in this situation is usually rescission or cancellation of the contract.Negligent misrepresentation is a statement that the defendant did not attempt to verify was true before executing a contract. This is a violation of the concept of "reasonable care" that a party must undertake before entering an agreement. The remedy for negligent misrepresentation is contract rescission and possibly damages.Fraudulent misrepresentation is a statement that the defendant made knowing it was false or that the defendant made recklessly to induce the other party to enter a contract. The injured party can seek to void the contract and to recover damages from the defendant.


   How to Prove Misrepresentation  

In order to recover damages due to misrepresentation, there are six legal bars for the plaintiff to overcome. The plaintiff must be able to show that:



A representation was made.The representation was false.The defendant knew at the time that the representation was false, or recklessly made the statement without knowledge of its truth.The representation was made with the intention that the plaintiff would rely on it.The plaintiff did rely on the false representation.The plaintiff suffered harm by relying on the false representation. 



All six of these requirements must be met in order for a plaintiff to win a case for misrepresentation. A defendant in one of these cases need not disprove all six of these claims.


   Example of Misrepresentation  

In 2022, Tesla CEO Elon Musk offered to purchase X platform (formerly Twitter) for $43 billion, an offer which the company at first resisted and then accepted. A few weeks later, and after a substantial fall in the company's share price, Musk attempted to back out of the deal, claiming that X misrepresented the number of human users on the platform.



According to his termination letter, Musk alleged that the company knowingly misrepresented the number of live users on its platform and that he had relied on those false representations when he made his takeover offer. In response, the social media company claimed that Musk's allegations were "factually inaccurate" and that the billionaire was simply trying to back out of the merger that he himself had initiated.




What Is a Material Misrepresentation?
A material misrepresentation is a promise, false statement, or omission of facts that would cause another party to act differently if the whole truth were known. An example of a material misrepresentation is incorrectly stating one's income on a mortgage application or omitting key risk factors on an application for insurance coverage.




What Is Misrepresentation in Insurance?
In insurance, a misrepresentation is a lie or concealment of facts that can void an insurance contract if the insurer discovers the misrepresentation. For example, if a homeowner installs a pool but tells their insurer that they do not have a pool, the insurer may be able to void the policy if they discover the misrepresentation.




What Is Misrepresentation in Real Estate?
In real estate, misrepresentation is a lie or reckless untruth that affects the market value of a home or property. A common example of this is misrepresenting the square footage of a property. Since sales prices are often based on square footage, a buyer can often sue for misrepresentation even after a purchase is finalized.


   The Bottom Line  

Misrepresentation is a legal term for any type of falsehood or omission of fact that affects the behavior of a contractor or other party. Contrary to popular belief, misrepresentation does not just mean deliberate lies—it can also include accidental omissions or reckless statements without certainty of the facts. Misrepresentation can void a contract and in some cases allow the misled party to seek damages.
What Is a Mission Statement?  

A mission statement is used by a company to explain, in simple and concise terms, its purpose(s) for being. The statement is generally short, either a single sentence or a short paragraph.





Key Takeaways

A mission statement is used by a company to explain, in simple and concise terms, its purpose(s) for being.It is usually one sentence or a short paragraph, explaining a company's culture, values, and ethics.Mission statements serve several purposes, including motivating employees and reassuring investors of the company's future.To craft a mission statement, consider how your company impacts customers, donors, investors, or your community and why you strive to help these parties.A mission statement might slightly overlap other marketing content, but it is different from a vision statement, value statement, brand, or slogan. 


   How a Mission Statement Works  

Mission statements serve a dual purpose by helping employees remain focused on the tasks at hand, and encouraging them to find innovative ways of moving toward increasing their productivity with the eye to achieving company goals.



A company’s mission statement defines its culture, values, ethics, fundamental goals, and agenda. Furthermore, it defines how each of these applies to the company's stakeholders—its employees, distributors, suppliers, shareholders, and the community at large. These entities can use this statement to align their goals with that of the company.



The statement reveals what the company does, how it does it, and why it does it. Prospective investors may also refer to the mission statement to see if the values of the company align with theirs. For example, an ethical investor against tobacco products would probably not invest in a company whose mission is to be the largest global manufacturer of cigarettes.



It is not uncommon for large companies to spend many years and millions of dollars to develop and refine their mission statements. In some cases, mission statements eventually become household phrases.



Mission statements aren't just for small or large companies. Many successful individuals, professionals, and investors have taken the time to craft a personal mission statement. These personal mission statements often incorporate the financial, professional, spiritual, and relational aspects of life. This, in turn, helps an individual maintain a healthy work/life balance that increases their personal achievement in all of these areas.


   Drafting a Mission Statement  

While it may be difficult to narrow down the focus of your company in a single statement, here are some tips to help you write a good mission statement.



First, outline what your company does. This may be a good you produce or a service you provide to your customers—whatever makes your business run.
Next, describe the way in which your company does what it does. Instead of being technical—that's not the point here—think of what values go into the core of your business. Maybe you value quality, customer service, or being sustainable. Alternatively, you may foster creativity and innovation in your business. These are key points to outline in your mission statement.
Finally, include why you do what you do in your mission statement. This is key. It helps you stand out as a business, highlighting what sets you apart from the others in your industry. Remember to keep the mission statement short and to the point.



After you've drafted it, remember to look it over, edit it, and have someone else give it a once over. After you've approved it, you'll need to find a way to incorporate it wherever you can. In addition, be mindful to periodically review your mission statement. Although it's never ideal to constantly pivot your image and change your mission statement, your company may outgrow or shift directions resulting in the need of a new statement.






A company’s mission is its identity, and its vision is its journey to accomplishing its mission. A company should take as long as it needs to craft the right statement to describe its mission.


   Displaying a Mission Statement  

Once a mission statement is crafted, it's up to the company to make it publicly known. A mission statement only holds value if it is shared with existing and potential customers, vendors, donors, or employees.



Because a company's mission statement is often pretty short, it is easy to incorporate into marketing material. A mission statement should always be found somewhere on a company's website. In addition, it can also be used in marketing documents. A company may solicit employees to incorporate adding its mission statement as part of a company-wide standard e-mail signature block.



A mission statement is also a perfect "elevator pitch" sentence that key members of your company should know. Because it's so brief, it is easy to memorize. In addition, it's a perfect introduction for someone who has never heard of your company or wants to know more. Whether it's at a networking event, social gathering, or bus ride to work, a mission statement is an easy way to captivate a stranger's interest in your company should they ask what your company does.


   Advantages and Disadvantages of Mission Statements  

Companies can benefit from having a mission statement. First, it outlines a company's goals and position in the industry for its customers, competitors, and other stakeholders. It also helps the organization focus and stay on track to make the right decisions about its future.



Furthermore, the mission statement helps clarify a company's purpose. With a mission statement, a company's customers and investors can rest assured that the company is fully committed to achieving its goals and maintaining its values. It is also useful to guide and motivate employees, keeping them in line with the company's values.



Last, a mission statement adds validity to an organization. From the outside looking in, a mission statement demonstrates that a company has considered the big picture and the major goals it wants to accomplish. It demonstrates thoughtful leadership, reputability, and inspiration to potential investors, employees, or donors.



There are drawbacks to having a mission statement. Mission statements may sometimes be very lofty and far too unrealistic, which can distract employees from the company's goals. Management may become too distracted with high-level targets that shorter-term, necessary steps to get there become neglected.



Even though a mission statement is short and concise, it may take a lot of time and money to develop. The resources spent on a bad mission statement could be better spent elsewhere, creating an opportunity loss. The difficulty of crafting such a concise statement is many parties often have ideas, and there's not room for many of them. After the bulk of the work has been done, companies may struggle with "wordsmithing" or simply rearranging words instead of trying to generate value.



Last, by publicly announcing to the world the company's mission, some people on the outside (or even the inside) may disagree with the mission. In the examples below, some individuals may be skeptical of alternative sources of energy and may be scared away when learning of Tesla's mission statement. A mission statement doesn't give much opportunity for a rebuttal to clarify or further explain what a company is all about.






A mission statement is not required, though it may be a grant application for a nonprofit or asked for by an interested investor of a company.


   Mission Statement Examples  

Mission statements vary considerably from company to company. The following examples are the mission statements of some of the trending companies as of 2022:



Nike (NKE): "Our mission is what drives us to do everything possible to expand human potential. We do that by creating groundbreaking sport innovations, by making our products more sustainably, by building a creative and diverse global team and by making a positive impact in communities where we live and work."
Walmart (WMT): "We save people money so they can live better."
Starbucks (SBUX): "To inspire and nurture the human spirit—one person, one cup, and one neighborhood at a time."
Tesla (TSLA): "To accelerate the world's transition to sustainable energy."
JP Morgan (JPM): "We aim to be the most respected financial services firm in the world."


   Mission Statements vs. Other Statements  

A mission statement is often confused or grouped with other types of organizational statements. Here are some other types of content and how they vary from a mission statement.


  Mission Statement vs. Vision Statement  

A company’s mission statement differs from its vision statement. While the mission statement remains unchanged for the most part and represents who the company is or aspires to be for the entirety of its existence, the vision statement can change. The latter outlines what the company needs to do to remain the way it has presented itself to be. In effect, a company’s mission is its identity, and the vision is its journey to accomplishing its mission.


  Mission Statement vs. Value Statement  

A company's value statement is also centered around a company's core principles and philosophy. However, it is more direct in guiding how decisions will be made and what will impact the daily culture of the organization. A value statement often includes actionable direction such as "taking ownership", "acting ethically", "doing what is right", or "being transparent." Whereas a mission statement describes the highest level of purpose, a vision statement starts to describe how that purpose will be achieved.


  Mission Statement vs. Company Goals  

A company's goals or business plan may be publicly disclosed or kept private/internal. In general, a company's goals are often even more specific, potentially referring to specific business lines, growth percentages, geographical regions, or new initiatives. While a mission statement often does not mention a specific aspect of the business, company goals are often measurable relating to departments or products so a company can track progress. A company's mission statement should drive the goals that are set.


  Mission Statement vs. Brand  

A brand is an suite of elements that encompasses a company's identity. This includes its marketing materials, engagement in community events, reviews from current and former employees, and its logo presence. A company's brand is also shaped by its mission statement. Though a small component, a mission statement helps customers, employees, and investors form an opinion of a company.


  Mission Statement vs. Slogan  

A slogan is a very brief, often memorable phrase that people primarily outside of your company can remember. Utter a great slogan such as "Just Do It" can invoke memories, commercials, logos, brand ambassadors, and emotions through a successful ad campaign. Although a mission statement is brief, it is longer and relatively more detailed compared to a slogan. A mission statement isn't meant to necessarily be catchy; it's meant to be informative and useful for guiding high-level decisions. Alternatively, a slogan is a very pointed marketing phrase used to be memorable even if it is less informative.




What Is a Mission Statement?
A mission statement is a brief description of the overarching meaning of the company or nonprofit. A mission statement does not explain what a company does or how it does it. It attempts to succinctly explain why a company exists and what its purpose is.




What Is an Example of a Mission Statement?
Microsoft's mission statement is: "Our mission is to empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more."




What Is in a Good Mission Statement?
A good mission statement is concise. It should be limited to one sentence, though it shouldn't be too limiting as it should encompass the entire company's purpose. A good mission statement also focuses on the long-term goal it wishes to deliver to customers.




How Do You Write a Mission Statement?
There's no single best way to come up with a mission statement. In general, the mission statement writing process should start with considering what a business does for the customers, employees, and general public. It's often best to begin by collecting more content than needed, then later refining the mission statement into a single sentence.One method of brainstorming ideas of a mission statement is to think about personal experiences from the company. This could also include soliciting ideas or memories from employees. Instead of focusing directly on the narrow business element of your company, embrace the broader aspect. For example, Microsoft did not craft its mission statement around delivering Windows '98. Rather, it crafted its mission statement around the possibilities it presented through its product.
What Is a Mixed Economic System?  

A mixed economic system is a system that combines aspects of both capitalism and socialism. A mixed economic system protects private property and allows a level of economic freedom in the use of capital, but also allows for governments to interfere in economic activities in order to achieve social aims.



According to neoclassical theory, mixed economies are less efficient than pure free markets, but proponents of government interventions argue that the base conditions required for efficiency in free markets, such as equal information and rational market participants, cannot be achieved in practical application.





Key Takeaways


A mixed economy is an economy organized with some free-market elements and some socialistic elements, which lies on a continuum somewhere between pure capitalism and pure socialism.
Mixed economies typically maintain private ownership of most of the means of production, with the government intervening through regulations.
Mixed economies socialize select industries that are deemed essential or that produce public goods.
All known historical and modern economies are examples of mixed economies, though some economists have critiqued the economic effects of various forms of mixed economy.

   Understanding Mixed Economic Systems  

Most modern economies feature a synthesis of two or more economic systems, with economies falling at some point along a continuum. The public sector works alongside the private sector, but they may compete for the same limited resources. Mixed economic systems do not block the private sector from profit-seeking, but do regulate business and may nationalize industries that provide a public good.



For example, the United States is a mixed economy, as it leaves ownership of the means of production in mostly private hands but incorporates elements such as subsidies for agriculture, regulation on manufacturing, and partial or full public ownership of some industries like letter delivery and national defense. In fact, all known historical and modern economies fall somewhere on the continuum of mixed economies. Both pure socialism and pure free markets represent theoretical constructs only.


   Mixed Economy vs. Free Markets  

Mixed economic systems are not laissez-faire systems, because the government is involved in planning the use of some resources and can exert control over businesses in the private sector. Governments may seek to redistribute wealth by taxing the private sector and by using funds from taxes to promote social objectives.



Trade protection, subsidies, targeted tax credits, fiscal stimulus, and public-private partnerships are common examples of government intervention in mixed economies. These unavoidably generate economic distortions, but they are instruments to achieve specific goals that may succeed despite their distortionary effect.



Countries often intervene in markets to promote target industries by creating agglomerations and reducing barriers to entry in an attempt to achieve a comparative advantage. This was common among East Asian countries in the 20th-century development strategy known as export-led growth, and the region has turned into a global manufacturing center for a variety of industries.



Some nations have come to specialize in textiles, while others are known for machinery, and others are hubs for electronic components. These sectors rose to prominence after governments protected young companies as they achieved competitive scale and promoted adjacent services such as shipping.


   Mixed Economy vs. Socialism  

Socialism entails common or centralized ownership of the means of production. Proponents of socialism believe that central planning can achieve a greater good for a larger number of people.



Socialists do not trust that the free-market outcomes will achieve the efficiency and optimization posited by classical economists, so socialists advocate the nationalization of all industries and the expropriation of privately owned capital goods, lands, and natural resources. Mixed economies rarely go to this extreme, instead, they identify only select instances in which intervention could achieve outcomes unlikely to be achieved in free markets.



Such measures can include price controls, income redistribution, and intense regulation of production and trade. Virtually universally this also includes the socialization of specific industries, known as public goods, that are considered essential and that economists believe the free market might not supply adequately, such as public utilities, military and police forces, and environmental protection. Unlike pure socialism, however, mixed economies usually otherwise maintain private ownership and control of the means of production.


   Characteristics of a Mixed Economy  

A mixed economy typically combines the features of a market-based economy with a strong public sector. While most prices are set by supply and demand, the government may intervene in the economy by enforcing price floors or ceilings for certain goods, or by directing public funds to certain industries at the expense of others.



The following are common examples of mixed-economy policies


  Social Welfare Programs  

Most mixed economies, even heavily market-oriented ones, offer benefits to those living at or near the poverty level. In the United States, the federal government provides SNAP benefits, Medicaid, and public housing to low-income individuals, while many state governments provide their own benefits.



Many countries in Western Europe have extremely generous social welfare programs, as well as government-provided health care and strong labor protections.


  Price Controls / Subsidies  

While prices in a mixed economy are generally set by the market, the government may intervene to prevent the prices of certain commodities from rising or falling below a certain level. For example, most mixed economies have minimum wage laws to prevent exploitation of the workforce, and they may use subsidies to support farmers or other key industries.


  Strong Business Regulations  

While most business activity is guided by the free market, governments may use regulations to protect the public from dangerous products, pollution, or monopolistic business practices. Many mixed economies have anti-trust laws to ensure that the marketplace remains competitive.


   Advantages and Disadvantages of a Mixed Economy  

A mixed economy combines several of the desirable qualities of both capitalist and socialist economic systems. The capitalist principles of free enterprise, market-based prices, and private property create incentives for innovation and efficiency, while elements of a welfare state and price controls guarantee a minimum standard of living.



However, social welfare programs can create a high tax burden and distort the market. Price controls, such as minimum wage laws, can have the unintended effects of reducing employment, according to the Philips curve. Other interventions, such as housing guarantees or free healthcare, can sometimes result in shortages because pricing does not reflect availability.



A mixed economy also allows the government to set its strategic priorities through selective interventions in the economy. For example, the United States gives favorable tax treatments to certain agricultural and manufacturing industries, because they are considered crucial for the country's long-term economic health.



Mixed economies can also result in less competition or regulatory capture, as private interests lobby for favorable regulations and tax treatment. This can have the perverse effect of regulations being determined by industries rather than policymakers.





Pros

Increased efficiency and productivity due to market-based incentives.
Minimal welfare protections for the poorest parts of the population.
Allows the government to set strategic priorities through economic policy.



Cons

Does not avoid the market-distorting effects of government intervention.
May succumb to regulatory capture as business interests campaign for favorable regulations.
Higher taxes to pay for welfare state policies.





   History and Criticism of the Mixed Economy  

The term mixed economy gained prominence in the United Kingdom after World War II, even though many of the policies associated with it at the time were first proposed in the 1930s. Many of the supporters were associated with the British Labour Party.



Critics argued that there could be no middle ground between economic planning and a market economy, and many—even today—question its validity when they believe it to be a combination of socialism and capitalism. Those who believe the two concepts don’t belong together say either market logic or economic planning must be prevalent in an economy.



Classical and Marxist theorists say that either the law of value or the accumulation of capital is what drives the economy, or that non-monetary forms of valuation (i.e. transactions without cash) are what ultimately propel the economy. These theorists believe that Western economies are still primarily based on capitalism because of the continued cycle of accumulation of capital.



Austrian economists starting with Ludwig von Mises have argued that a mixed economy is not sustainable because the unintended consequences of government intervention into the economy, such as the shortages that routinely result from price controls, will consistently lead to further calls for ever-increasing intervention to offset their effects. This suggests that the mixed economy is inherently unstable and will always tend toward a more socialistic state over time.



Beginning in the mid-20th century, economists of the Public Choice school have described how the interaction of government policymakers, economic interest groups, and markets can guide policy in a mixed economy away from the public interest. Economic policy in the mixed economy unavoidably diverts the flow of economic activity, trade, and income away from some individuals, firms, industries, and regions and toward others.



Not only can this create harmful distortions in the economy by itself, but it always creates winners and losers. This sets up powerful incentives for interested parties to take some resources away from productive activities to use instead for the purpose of lobbying or otherwise seeking to influence economic policy in their own favor. This non-productive activity is known as rent-seeking.


   Real-World Examples  

Technically, almost every country can be considered a mixed economy, since it is difficult for a country to sustain economic activity without some degree of government intervention or market activity. Even North Korea allows a limited number of private markets.



But the best examples of mixed economies are those countries where the government takes a significant role in directing the course of the market economy. Many countries in Western Europe are considered mixed economies because the government offers generous welfare programs and tight regulations on business activity. The United States, for example, has many social programs to benefit the poor, as well as several government-owned enterprises.



Conversely, many socialist-oriented countries can be considered mixed economies because of their large private sectors. Both China and Vietnam have successfully privatized many of their state-owned enterprises while retaining a leading role for the government in economic affairs.




What Are the Characteristics of a Mixed Economy?
The characteristics of a mixed economy include allowing supply and demand to determine fair prices, the protection of private property, innovation being promoted, standards of employment, the limitation of government in business yet allowing the government to provide overall welfare, and market facilitation by the self-interest of the players involved.




What Are the Disadvantages of a Mixed Economy?
Mixed economies stress profit above all else, including the well-being of citizens, there tends to be mismanagement at various levels, it creates economic inequality throughout the population as wealth is not distributed evenly, inefficiency occurs due to government involvement, and the working class can be exploited.




What Are the 4 Main Types of Economic Systems?
The four main types of economic systems are a pure market economy, a pure command economy, a mixed economy, and a traditional economy.




Which Countries Have a Mixed Economy?
Countries that have a mixed economy include the United States, the United Kingdom, Sweden, Iceland, and India.


   The Bottom Line  

A mixed economy features many of the desirable qualities of both capitalism and socialism, as well as some of their drawbacks. This type of economy allows the government to provide public goods and a basic safety net while enjoying the productivity of a market-based economy. In practice, most countries of the world are mixed economies, although some are more market-oriented and others are more state-led.
What Is Mobile Banking?  

Mobile banking is the act of making financial transactions on a mobile device (cell phone, tablet, etc.). This activity can be as simple as a bank sending fraud or usage activity to a client’s cell phone or as complex as a client paying bills or sending money abroad. Advantages to mobile banking include the ability to bank anywhere and at any time. Disadvantages include security concerns and a limited range of capabilities when compared to banking in person or on a computer.


   Understanding Mobile Banking  

Mobile banking is very convenient in today’s digital age with many banks offering impressive apps. The ability to deposit a check, to pay for merchandise, to transfer money to a friend or to find an ATM instantly are reasons why people choose to use mobile banking. However, establishing a secure connection before logging into a mobile banking app is important or else a client might risk personal information being compromised.


   Mobile Banking and Cybersecurity  

Cybersecurity has become increasingly important in many mobile banking operations. Cybersecurity encompasses a wide range of measures taken to keep electronic information private and avoid damage or theft. It is also used to make data is not misused, extending from personal information to complex government systems.



Three main types of cyber attacks can occur. These are:



Backdoor attacks, in which thieves exploit alternate methods of accessing a system that doesn't require the usual means of authentication. Some systems have backdoors by design; others result from an error.
Denial-of-service attacks prevent the rightful user from accessing the system. For example, thieves might enter a wrong password enough times that the account is locked.
The direct-access attack includes bugs and viruses, which gain access to a system and copy its information and/or modify it.



Steps financial advisors can take to protect their clients against cyber attacks include:



Helping educate clients about the importance of strong, unique passwords (e.g, not reusing the same one for every password-protected site), along with how a password manager like Valt or LastPass can add an extra layer of security.
Never accessing client data from a public location, and being sure the connection is always private and secure.


   Mobile Banking and Remittances  

Remittances are funds that an expatriate sends to their country of origin via wire, mail, or mobile banking (online transfer). These peer-to-peer transfers of funds across borders have enormous economic significance for many of the countries that receive them – so much so that the World Bank and the Gates Foundation have set up complex tracking mechanisms. They estimate that remittances to developing countries amounted to $529 billion in 2018, up 9.6% from the previous record high $486 billion recorded in 2017.
What Is Mobile Commerce?  

Mobile commerce, also known as m-commerce, involves using wireless handheld devices like cell phones and tablets to conduct commercial transactions online, including the purchase and sale of products, online banking, and paying bills.





Key Takeaways

Mobile commerce refers to business or purchases that are conducted over mobile devices like cell phones or tablets.M-commerce lets users transact anywhere, provided that there's a wireless Internet provider available in that area.Mobile commerce has increased rapidly as security issues have been resolved.Companies like Apple and Google have introduced their own mobile commerce services.


   Understanding Mobile Commerce  

Mobile commerce is a large subset of electronic commerce, a model where firms or individuals conduct business over the Internet. As of 2023, nearly 97% of Americans own a cell phone, and 85% of them owned a smartphone. This is up from 35% in 2011.



Many products and services can be transacted via m-commerce, including banking, investing, and purchases of books, plane tickets, and digital music. The rapid growth of mobile commerce has been driven by several factors, including increased wireless handheld device computing power, a proliferation of m-commerce applications, and the resolution of security issues.


   M-Commerce vs. E-Commerce  

Electronic commerce (e-commerce) refers to buying and selling goods and services over the Internet. E-commerce can be conducted via a desktop computer, laptop, smartphone, or tablet, but it's typically associated with a computer in which a user has to find a location with an Internet connection.



Conversely, m-commerce specifically refers to transactions done via a smartphone or mobile device. M-commerce users can transact anywhere provided that there's a wireless Internet provider available in that area.






M-commerce transactions tend to be accomplished with a few clicks. E-commerce is done via a tablet, laptop, or desktop and might involve more time and exploring a company's website.


   Benefits of Mobile Commerce  

The range of devices capable of mobile commerce has grown. Digital wallets like Apple Pay and Google Pay let customers make in-store purchases without the inconvenience of swiping cards. Social media platforms such as Facebook, X (formerly Twitter), Pinterest, and Instagram, launched "buy buttons" on their mobile platforms during the mid- to late-2010s. This enabled users to conveniently make purchases from other retailers directly from these social media sites.



M-commerce apps allow for location tracking via GPS to offer customers help finding items in stores. Personalized shopping experiences can also connect retailers with their clients.






Digital commerce transactions are likely to continue climbing as content delivery over wireless devices becomes more streamlined, secure, and scalable.


   Ways to Improve Mobile Commerce  

Quick-loading web pages are likely to win more sales because consumers can be impatient and demand instant gratification. Mobile checkouts must let buyers easily enter payment information, preferably with mobile wallets that eliminate the use of manual entry, thereby reducing human error and facilitating a smoother checkout experience.


   Mobile Commerce Videos and Marketing  

Mobile applications that use video to demonstrate a product's key features are likely to generate more revenue. An online foreign exchange broker who sends video links illustrating its new mobile trading application will likely win more clients.


   Mobile Web and Mobile Applications  

Consumers typically use Google or social media promotions to initiate online shopping searches. Browsers tend to drive more transactions than mobile applications as a result. Consumers often pair the use of mobile applications with mobile websites for this reason, to enhance their overall shopping experience.




What Is M-Commerce Most Commonly Used for?
M-commerce has streamlined the processes of shopping, banking, and bill payment. Many consumers can easily manage their financial lives on their phones. Digital wallets are also a common convenience.




How Much in the Way of Sales Has M-Commerce Generated?
Mobile commerce sales in the United States were an estimated $431 billion in 2022, according to the market research company Statista.




Are There Risks Associated With M-Commerce?
Anyone who owns a cell phone can tell you that they're easy enough to misplace and lose. You might think your phone is safe in your pocket and break into a jog in the park, only to realize 10 minutes later that it fell out somewhere along the way. The phone's contents, including your personal financial information, passcodes and links, might be easily accessed by anyone who finds it.This could have disastrous results if you haven't taken safety precautions. But security can be enhanced by setting up multi-factor authentication, including biometrics such as fingerprints and retina scans.


   The Bottom Line  

M-commerce provides numerous benefits to both businesses and consumers. It's a rare individual who doesn't own some type of mobile device and businesses can reach them more easily with the advent of mobile commerce. Consumers can access coupons and discounts directly on their devices and accomplish banking tasks with ease. It's a win/win for both sides and advantages should continue to grow as new technology is discovered and advanced.
What Is a Mobile Wallet?  

A mobile wallet stores credit card or debit card information on a mobile device like your phone, a tablet, or smartwatch. Mobile wallets are a convenient way for you to buy things online or in stores that are set up to take payments through the wallet. They may also be more secure than physical payment cards because of the technology they use to protect your account information.

Key Takeaways

Mobile wallets are apps for storing financial information and other documents such as credit cards, bank information, and even driver's licenses.Many smartphones come loaded with their own mobile wallets, but there are also other mobile wallet apps you can download.Mobile wallets use near-field communication technology, which requires you to be near a payment terminal at the cash register when paying for something in person.Mobile wallets use many layers of encryption and security to ensure that transactions are safe.


   Understanding a Mobile Wallet  

A mobile wallet is either a built-in feature or an app that can be installed onto smartphones. A mobile wallet stores credit card, debit card, coupon, or reward card information and can connect directly to bank accounts. 



Often the terms "mobile wallet" and "mobile payments" are used interchangeably, but there are slight differences between them. Three of the main mobile built-in wallets are Apple Wallet, Google Wallet, and Samsung Wallet. These apps store your payment card information but can also hold other documents such as event tickets, vaccination records, or airline boarding passes. They are integrated with their respective payment services (Apple Pay, Google Pay, and Samsung Wallet), which are used to make payments. You as a user may not even notice the difference between, say, Apple Wallet and Apple Pay.



When you make a payment in a store, restaurant, or other retail space like a movie theater, the payment app uses a technology called near-field communication (NFC), which uses radio frequencies to communicate between devices. NFC uses the personal identification format created for the user to communicate the payment information to the merchant’s point-of-service (POS) terminal. The information transfer is usually triggered when the user waves or holds an NFC-enabled mobile device over the store’s NFC reader.



Let's say you've set up Apple Pay with your debit card information and want to use it to buy a meal at McDonald's. You would hold your phone next to the reader that the McDonald's employee hands you, which would use NFC technology to communicate with your phone.



Apple Pay would open using a verification method such as face recognition or a passcode, and then ask you to click a button to confirm payment through the default payment method you have stored with the app. (You could also tap the app to use a different card you've stored in the app.) The payment information is sent through NFC technology.


  Security  

Your debit card information is never stored on the device. Instead, when you sign up for the service, the card information is encrypted and stored on a secure chip. When you make a purchase, Apple uses a token—a unique, randomly-generated number that can be mapped to your original data. If a thief should get hold of the token, it would be totally useless to them.


   Available Mobile Wallet Apps  

Today, most smartphones and mobile devices are equipped with NFC technology. iPhones have Apple Wallet and Apple Pay, Android phones are often equipped with Google Wallet and Google Pay, and Samsung Galaxy phones are preloaded with their proprietary Samsung Wallet, which includes Samsung Pay. Besides what comes preloaded on smartphones, mobile wallets from other companies have also become very popular.



Some apps developed by third parties include:



PayPal. The online payment platform is available for download on both iOS and Android devices. Fees vary for PayPal—check to see if your payment method has fees attached.Google Pay. Google Pay comes loaded on many Android phones, but it's also available for download on Apple (iOS) phones. Venmo. Venmo started as a peer-to-peer app but is slowly making a foothold with retailers as well. Venmo does charge a 3% fee for any purchases made with a credit card linked to the platform. Transactions that draw from a bank account are free.


   Benefits of Mobile Wallets  

Fraudulent activities, such as identity theft, are harder to initiate with mobile wallets. Though a user’s credit card can easily be stolen or duplicated, smartphones are not so easy to steal. A smartphone that is stolen may be hard to access if there is an access password, fingerprint check, or facial recognition installed.



As discussed above, mobile wallets don't store your card information on the phone, and use encryption and tokenization for secure transactions.



Using a mobile wallet can be faster than using a chip card for a payment. And because mobile wallets are a digitized version of physical wallets, almost every valuable card stored in a physical wallet can also be stored in a mobile wallet, such as a driver’s license, Social Security card, health insurance cards, loyalty cards, hotel key cards, and bus or train tickets.


   Digital Wallets vs. Mobile Wallets/Payments  

"Digital wallet" is another term used interchangeably with "mobile wallet" or "mobile payments." However, though they both store payment information, they are implemented differently. Digital wallets are mostly used for online transactions and may not necessarily be used on mobile devices. Mobile wallets are used by people who would rather not carry a physical wallet when making in-store purchases. For this reason, these wallets have to be used on mobile and easy-to-carry platforms.



Apple Pay, Samsung Pay, and Google Pay are examples of mobile payments that can be installed on a handheld or wearable device. A regular PayPal account is a form of a digital wallet, but when used in conjunction with mobile payment services and mobile devices, it functions as a mobile wallet.




Is a Digital Wallet the Same as a Mobile Wallet?
Though digital wallets and mobile wallets are very similar, they aren't the same. Digital wallets are typically for online transactions, whereas mobile wallets are tied to a smartphone or wearable device. Both connect to bank accounts and credit cards for purchasing on the go.




Can I Use Apple Pay on an Android Phone?
Most smartphone makers use proprietary mobile wallets on their phones. Only iOS devices may use Apple Pay, just as only Samsung phones can use Samsung Pay. For universal use, download a third-party mobile wallet like PayPal or Venmo.




Can I Use My Mobile Wallet on My Smartwatch?
Many tech wearables are now capable of using mobile wallets. Depending on the device, it may come preloaded with a mobile wallet, such as Apple Pay on an Apple Watch.


   The Bottom Line  

Mobile wallets allow people to use their phones to pay for everyday services. With complex encryption and security features, using a mobile wallet can actually be safer than using a physical card. Most phones now come preloaded with the company's mobile wallet app, but there are options, such as Venmo, that work with all phone brands.
What Is the Mode?  

The mode is the value that appears most frequently in a data set. A set of data may have one mode, more than one mode, or no mode at all. Other popular measures of central tendency include the mean, or the average of a set, and the median, the middle value in a set.





Key Takeaways

In statistics, the mode is the most commonly observed value in a set of data.For the normal distribution, the mode is also the same value as the mean and median.In many cases, the modal value will differ from the average value in the data.


   Understanding the Mode  

In statistics, data can be distributed in various ways. The most often cited distribution is the classic normal (bell-curve) distribution. In this, and some other distributions, the mean (average) value falls at the midpoint, which is also the peak frequency of observed values.



For such a distribution, the mean, median, and mode are all the same values. This means that this value is the average value, the middle value, and also the mode—the most frequently occurring value in the data.



Mode is most useful as a measure of central tendency when examining categorical data, such as models of cars or flavors of soda, for which a mathematical average median value based on ordering can not be calculated.


   Examples of the Mode  

For example, in the following list of numbers, 16 is the mode since it appears more times in the set than any other number:



3, 3, 6, 9, 16, 16, 16, 27, 27, 37, 48



A set of numbers can have more than one mode (this is known as bimodal if there are two modes) if there are multiple numbers that occur with equal frequency, and more times than the others in the set.



3, 3, 3, 9, 16, 16, 16, 27, 37, 48



In the above example, both the number 3 and the number 16 are modes as they each occur three times and no other number occurs more often.



If no number in a set of numbers occurs more than once, that set has no mode:



3, 6, 9, 16, 27, 37, 48



A set of numbers with two modes is bimodal, a set of numbers with three modes is trimodal, and any set of numbers with more than one mode is multimodal.






When scientists or statisticians talk about the modal observation, they are referring to the most common observation.


   Mode vs. Mean vs. Median  

Mean, median, and mode are all different ways of noting the center of a data set.



Mode is the most common set of numbers, while mean is the average and median is the midpoint.


  Mean  

Mean is the average of a set of numbers. To calculate the mean, begin by adding up all of the data points and dividing by the total number of data points. For example, suppose you have the following series of numbers:



3, 3, 6, 9, 16, 16, 16, 27, 27, 37, 48



Added together, you get 208. Divide 208 by 11 (the number of data points) to get the mean, which is 18.9.


  Median  

The median is the data point in the middle of a set. To find the median, the numbers in the set must be arranged from smallest to largest. Let's use the numbers in the example above:



3, 3, 6, 9, 16, 16, 16, 27, 27, 37, 48



The median is 16, the data point in the exact middle of the set. This set has an odd number of data points, which makes it easier to find the middle. For a set with an even number of data points, you'd take the mean of the two middle numbers to find the median.


   Advantages and Disadvantages of the Mode  



Advantages

The mode is easy to understand and calculate.
The mode is not affected by extreme values.
The mode is easy to identify in a data set and in a discrete frequency distribution.
The mode is useful for qualitative data.
The mode can be computed in an open-ended frequency table.
The mode can be located graphically.



Disadvantages

The mode is not defined when there are no repeats in a data set.
The mode is not based on all values.
The mode is unstable when the data consist of a small number of values.
Sometimes the data has one mode, more than one mode, or no mode at all.







How Do I Calculate the Mode?
Calculating the mode is fairly straightforward. Place all numbers in a given set in order; this can be from lowest to highest or highest to lowest, and then count how many times each number appears in the set. The one that appears the most is the mode.




What Is Mode in Statistics With an Example?
The mode in statistics refers to a number in a set of numbers that appears the most often. For example, if a set of numbers contained the following digits, 1, 1, 3, 5, 6, 6, 7, 7, 7, 8, the mode would be 7, as it appears the most out of all the numbers in the set.




What Is the Difference Between Mode and Mean?
The mode is the number in a set of numbers that appears the most often. The mean of a set of numbers is the sum of all the numbers divided by the number of values in the set. The mean is also known as the average.


   The Bottom Line  

In statistics, the mode is the number that occurs most often. A data set can have one or more modes. The mode is different from the mean, which is the average of the numbers in a set; it's also different from the median, which is the midpoint of a set. Finding the mode in a set of numbers can tell you which data points occur most commonly, which can be useful information when analyzing statistics.
What Is Model Risk?  

Model risk is a type of risk that occurs when a financial model is used to measure quantitative information such as a firm's market risks or value transactions, and the model fails or performs inadequately and leads to adverse outcomes for the firm.



A model is a system, quantitative method, or approach that relies on assumptions and economic, statistical, mathematical, or financial theories and techniques. The model processes data inputs into a quantitative-estimate type of output.



Financial institutions and investors use models to identify the theoretical value of stock prices and to pinpoint trading opportunities. While models can be useful tools in investment analysis, they can also be prone to various risks that can occur from the usage of inaccurate data, programming errors, technical errors, and misinterpretation of the model's outputs.





Key Takeaways

In finance, models are used extensively to identify potential future stock values, pinpoint trading opportunities, and help company managers make business decisions.Model risk is present whenever an insufficiently accurate model is used to make decisions.Model risk can stem from using a model with bad specifications, programming or technical errors, or data or calibration errors.Model risk can be reduced with model management such as testing, governance policies, and independent review.


   Understanding Model Risk  

Model risk is considered a subset of operational risk, as model risk mostly affects the firm that creates and uses the model. Traders or other investors who use a given model may not completely understand its assumptions and limitations, which limits the usefulness and application of the model itself.



In financial companies, model risk can affect the outcome of financial securities valuations, but it's also a factor in other industries. A model can incorrectly predict the probability of an airline passenger being a terrorist or the probability or a fraudulent credit card transaction. This can be due to incorrect assumptions, programming or technical errors, and other factors that increase the risk of a poor outcome.


   What Does the Concept of Model Risk Tell You?  

Any model is a simplified version of reality, and with any simplification, there is the risk that something will fail to be accounted for. Assumptions made to develop a model and inputs into the model can vary widely. The use of financial models has become very prevalent in the past decades, in step with advances in computing power, software applications, and new types of financial securities. Before developing a financial model, companies will often conduct a financial forecast, which is the process by which it determines the expectations of future results.



Some companies, such as banks, employ a model risk officer to establish a financial model risk management program aimed at reducing the likelihood of the bank suffering financial losses due to model risk issues. Components of the program include establishing model governance and policies. It also involves assigning roles and responsibilities to individuals who will develop, test, implement, and manage the financial models on an ongoing basis.


   Real World Examples of Model Risk  
  Long-Term Capital Management  

The Long-Term Capital Management (LTCM) debacle in 1998 was attributed to model risk. In this case, a small error in the firm's computer models was made larger by several orders of magnitude because of the highly leveraged trading strategy LTCM employed.﻿﻿



At its height, the hedge fund managed over $100 billion in assets and reported annual returns of over 40%. LTCM famously had two Nobel Prize winners in economics as principal shareholders, but the firm imploded due to its financial model that failed in that particular market environment.


  JPMorgan Chase  

Almost 15 years later, JPMorgan Chase (JPM) suffered massive trading losses from a value at risk (VaR) model that contained formula and operational errors. Risk managers use VaR models to estimate the future losses a portfolio could potentially incur. In 2012, CEO Jamie Dimon's proclaimed "tempest in a teapot" turned out to be a $6.2 billion loss resulting from trades gone wrong in its synthetic credit portfolio (SCP).﻿﻿



A trader had established large derivative positions that were flagged by the VaR model that existed at the time. In response, the bank's chief investment officer made adjustments to the VaR model, but due to a spreadsheet error in the model, trading losses were allowed to pile up without warning signals from the model.



This was not the first time that VaR models have failed. In 2007 and 2008, VaR models were criticized for failing to predict the extensive losses many banks suffered during the global financial crisis.﻿﻿
What Is the Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT)?  

The modern portfolio theory (MPT) is a practical method for selecting investments in order to maximize their overall returns within an acceptable level of risk. This mathematical framework is used to build a portfolio of investments that maximize the amount of expected return for the collective given level of risk.



American economist Harry Markowitz pioneered this theory in his paper "Portfolio Selection," which was published in the Journal of Finance in 1952. He was later awarded a Nobel Prize for his work on modern portfolio theory.



A key component of the MPT theory is diversification. Most investments are either high risk and high return or low risk and low return. Markowitz argued that investors could achieve their best results by choosing an optimal mix of the two based on an assessment of their individual tolerance to risk.





Key Takeaways

The modern portfolio theory (MPT) is a method that can be used by risk-averse investors to construct diversified portfolios that maximize their returns without unacceptable levels of risk.The modern portfolio theory can be useful to investors trying to construct efficient and diversified portfolios using ETFs.Investors who are more concerned with downside risk might prefer the post-modern portfolio theory (PMPT) to MPT.












Investopedia / Matthew Collins


   Understanding the Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT)  

The modern portfolio theory argues that any given investment's risk and return characteristics should not be viewed alone but should be evaluated by how it affects the overall portfolio's risk and return. That is, an investor can construct a portfolio of multiple assets that will result in greater returns without a higher level of risk.



As an alternative, starting with a desired level of expected return, the investor can construct a portfolio with the lowest possible risk that is capable of producing that return.



Based on statistical measures such as variance and correlation, a single investment's performance is less important than how it impacts the entire portfolio.






  Acceptable Risk  

The MPT assumes that investors are risk-averse, meaning they prefer a less risky portfolio to a riskier one for a given level of return. As a practical matter, risk aversion implies that most people should invest in multiple asset classes.



The expected return of the portfolio is calculated as a weighted sum of the returns of the individual assets. If a portfolio contained four equally weighted assets with expected returns of 4%, 6%, 10%, and 14%, the portfolio's expected return would be:



(4% x 25%) + (6% x 25%) + (10% x 25%) + (14% x 25%) = 8.5%



The portfolio's risk is a function of the variances of each asset and the correlations of each pair of assets. To calculate the risk of a four-asset portfolio, an investor needs each of the four assets' variances and six correlation values, since there are six possible two-asset combinations with four assets. Because of the asset correlations, the total portfolio risk, or standard deviation, is lower than what would be calculated by a weighted sum.


   Benefits of the MPT  

The MPT is a useful tool for investors who are trying to build diversified portfolios. In fact, the growth of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) made the MPT more relevant by giving investors easier access to a broader range of asset classes.



For example, stock investors can reduce risk by putting a portion of their portfolios in government bond ETFs. The variance of the portfolio will be significantly lower because government bonds have a negative correlation with stocks. Adding a small investment in Treasuries to a stock portfolio will not have a large impact on expected returns because of this loss-reducing effect.


  Looking for Negative Correlation  

Similarly, the MPT can be used to reduce the volatility of a U.S. Treasury portfolio by putting 10% in a small-cap value index fund or ETF. Although small-cap value stocks are far riskier than Treasuries on their own, they often do well during periods of high inflation when bonds do poorly. As a result, the portfolio's overall volatility is lower than it would be if it consisted entirely of government bonds. Moreover, the expected returns are higher.



The modern portfolio theory allows investors to construct more efficient portfolios. Every possible combination of assets can be plotted on a graph, with the portfolio's risk on the X-axis and the expected return on the Y-axis. This plot reveals the most desirable combinations for a portfolio.



For example, suppose Portfolio A has an expected return of 8.5% and a standard deviation of 8%. Assume that Portfolio B has an expected return of 8.5% and a standard deviation of 9.5%. Portfolio A would be deemed more efficient because it has the same expected return but lower risk.



It is possible to draw an upward sloping curve to connect all of the most efficient portfolios. This curve is called the efficient frontier.



Investing in a portfolio underneath the curve is not desirable because it does not maximize returns for a given level of risk.


   Criticism of the MPT  

Perhaps the most serious criticism of the MPT is that it evaluates portfolios based on variance rather than downside risk.



That is, two portfolios that have the same level of variance and returns are considered equally desirable under modern portfolio theory. One portfolio may have that variance because of frequent small losses. Another could have that variance because of rare but spectacular declines. Most investors would prefer frequent small losses, which would be easier to endure.



The post-modern portfolio theory (PMPT) attempts to improve modern portfolio theory by minimizing downside risk instead of variance.


  Frequently Asked Questions  


What Is the Difference Between the Modern Portfolio Theory and the Post-Modern Portfolio Theory?
The modern portfolio theory (MPT) was a breakthrough in personal investing. It suggests that a conservative investor can do better by choosing a mix of low-risk and riskier investments than by going entirely with low-risk choices. More importantly, it suggests that the more rewarding option does not add additional overall risk. This is the key attribute of portfolio diversification.The post-modern portfolio theory (PMPT) does not contradict these basic assumptions. However, it changes the formula for evaluating risk in an investment in order to correct what its developers perceived as flaws in the original.Followers of both theories use software that relies on either MPT or PMPT to build portfolios that match the level of risk that they seek.




What Are the Benefits of the Modern Portfolio Theory?
The modern portfolio theory can be used to diversify a portfolio in order to get a better return overall without a bigger risk.Another benefit of the modern portfolio theory (and of diversification) is that it can reduce volatility. The best way to do that is to choose assets that have a negative correlation, such as U.S. treasuries and small-cap stocks.Ultimately, the goal of the modern portfolio theory is to create the most efficient portfolio possible.




What Is the Importance of the Efficient Frontier in the MPT?
The efficient frontier is a cornerstone of the modern portfolio theory. It is the line that indicates the combination of investments that will provide the highest level of return for the lowest level of risk.When a portfolio falls to the right of the efficient frontier, it possesses greater risk relative to its predicted return. When it falls beneath the slope of the efficient frontier, it offers a lower level of return relative to risk.
What Is the Modified Accelerated Cost Recovery System (MACRS)?  

The modified accelerated cost recovery system (MACRS) is a depreciation system used for tax purposes in the U.S. MACRS depreciation allows the capitalized cost of an asset to be recovered over a specified period via annual deductions. The MACRS system puts fixed assets into classes that have set depreciation periods.





Key Takeaways

The modified accelerated cost recovery system (MACRS) allows a business to recover the cost basis of certain assets that deteriorate over time.The IRS provides guidelines on which assets are eligible for MACRS and what useful life figure should be used.MACRS allows for faster depreciation in the first years of an asset's life and slows depreciation later on.From a tax perspective, MACRS deprecation is more beneficial compared to some other methods.There are two types of MACRS systems—the General Depreciation System (GDS) and the Alternative Depreciation System (ADS).


   Understanding the Modified Accelerated Cost Recovery System (MACRS)  

As defined by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), depreciation is an income tax deduction that allows a business to recover the cost basis of certain property. Deprecation is an annual allowance for the wear and tear, deterioration, or obsolescence of property. Most tangible assets are depreciable. Likewise, certain intangible assets, such as patents and copyrights, are depreciable.



The modified accelerated cost recovery system (MACRS) is the proper depreciation method for most assets. MACRS allows for greater accelerated depreciation over longer time periods. This is beneficial since faster acceleration allows individuals and businesses to deduct greater amounts during the first few years of an asset's life, and relatively less later.



Depreciation using MACRS can be applied to assets such as computer equipment, office furniture, automobiles, fences, farm buildings, racehorses, and so on.






For property placed into service after 1986, the IRS requires businesses use MACRS for depreciation.



Now, there are things for which MACRS cannot be used for. Notably, intangible property, films, video tapes, and recordings. Other property excluded from MACRS include certain corporate or partnership property acquired in nontaxable transfers.


   Types of Modified Accelerated Cost Recovery Systems (MACRS)  

There are two key MACRS deprecation systems. The first is the general depreciation system (GDS), while the second is the alternative depreciation system (ADS). These two systems have different recovery periods and depreciation methods. For the most part, GDS is used, although in special cases ADS can be used.



The general depreciation system uses the declining balance method, which allows for a larger deprecation expense to be recorded in the early years and smaller amounts in the later years. The alternative deprecation system allows depreciation to be taken over a longer period of time.



The GDS is best used for assets that depreciate quickly, such as computers and other technology. Meanwhile, the ADS must be used in certain instances, such as property used in a farming business, property that is exempt from taxation, or any property used outside the U.S. ADS must also be used for any listed property used 50% or less in a business during the tax year.



Now, businesses can elect to use ADS (instead of GDS). The election must cover all property in the same property class, and once made, that election can never be changed.


   Property Classifications  

The IRS publishes the useful lives of various classes of assets. This information is used to compute the depreciation for a given type of qualified asset. A few examples of some assets and their useful lives in years as published by the IRS include.

The IRS's Publication 946 (How To Depreciate Property) has a full breakdown of asset classes and their useful lives. Since the tax rules for MACRS are complex, the 100-plus pages of the IRS Publication 946 provide complete guidance on depreciating assets with MACRS.



The nine asset classes presented above are for GDS. There are more asset classes for ADS and the recovery life is longer. For example, the useful life of residential rental property under ADS is 30 years, and for commercial property its 40 years.



Based on the information provided in the table, a business can determine its tax depreciation for assets. The basis for depreciation of MACRS property is the property's cost basis multiplied by the percentage of business/investment use. The amount derived is recognized in the company’s income tax return and used to determine taxable income by factoring in any tax credits and deductions that can be claimed on the property.



Note that the derived tax depreciation is not recorded in the financial statements, as these statements calculate depreciation using the straight-line depreciation method or some other form of accelerated cost depreciation method.






MACRS is used for tax purposes and not for financial statements, as it's not approved by U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP). For example, a company may use MACRS for tax depreciation and straight-line depreciation for creating financial statements.


   MACRS FAQs   
  What Is IRS Publication 946?  

IRS Publication 946 is a publication by the IRS that details how to depreciate property. In particular, it explains how to recover the cost of property (such as business equipment or income-producing asset) via deprecation.


  What Are the Tax Benefits of Depreciation?  

Depreciation expenses lower the amount of income on which taxes are based, thereby reducing the amount of taxes owed. The benefit of accelerated depreciation is that you are getting a greater tax reduction in the earlier years of an asset's useful life.


  What Does Useful Life Mean?  

Useful life is the accounting estimate of the number of years an asset is likely to remain in service for the purpose of producing income. The IRS determines the useful life for various assets, laying out the length of time in which they can be depreciated. For example, the useful life (according to the IRS) for automobiles is five years, while residential rental properties have a useful life of 27.5 years.
What Is Modified Accrual Accounting?  

Modified accrual accounting is an alternative bookkeeping method that combines accrual basis accounting with cash basis accounting. It recognizes revenues when they become available and measurable and, with a few exceptions, records expenditures when liabilities are incurred. Modified accrual accounting is commonly used by government agencies.





Key Takeaways


Modified accrual accounting is a method that combines accrual basis accounting with cash basis accounting.
This bookkeeping system combines the simplicity of cash accounting with the more sophisticated ability of accrual accounting to match related revenues with expenses.
Modified accrual accounting borrows elements from both cash and accrual accounting depending on whether the assets are long-term or short-term.
Public companies cannot use this accounting method for financial statements, but it is widely accepted for use by government agencies.
Public companies cannot use modified accrual accounting because it does not comply with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) or the generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).



   Understanding Modified Accrual Accounting  

To understand how modified accrual accounting works it is first essential to break down how the traditional bookkeeping practices are influenced by function.



Cash basis accounting recognizes transactions upon the exchange of cash. Expenses are not recognized until they are paid and revenue is not recognized until payment has been received. That means that future obligations or anticipated revenues are not recorded in financial statements until the cash transaction has occurred.
In contrast, accrual accounting recognizes expenses when they are incurred, regardless of the payment status of the charges, and records revenue when a legal obligation is created. This indicates the company has fulfilled an obligation and has earned the right to collect, say at the point when the goods are shipped or at the completion of a service.



Modified accrual accounting borrows elements from both cash and accrual accounting, depending on whether assets are long-term, such as fixed assets and long-term debt, or short-term, such as accounts receivable (AR) and inventory.


   Recording Short-Term Events  

The modified accrual practice follows the cash method of accounting when economic events affecting the short term have occurred. An economic event is recorded in the short term when the cash balance has been affected. The result of this rule is that almost all items recorded on the income statement are recorded using the cash basis, and items including accounts receivable and inventory are not recorded on the balance sheet.


   Recording Long-Term Events  

Economic events expected to impact multiple reporting periods are recorded using rules similar to the accrual method. This directly impacts the way fixed assets and long-term debt are documented. Under the modified accrual method, these long-term items are recorded on the balance sheet and depreciated, depleted, or amortized over the life of the asset or liability. This systematic distribution of expenses or revenues allows future financial statements to have more comparability.


   Special Considerations  

A modified accrual accounting system combines the simplicity of cash accounting with the more sophisticated ability of accrual accounting to match related revenues with expenses.



It is not commonly used by public companies, however, as it does not comply with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) or the generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), which outline what procedures companies must follow when preparing their officially reported financial statements. Businesses that wish to use this method must do so for internal purposes and then convert transactions recorded under a cash basis to accrual accounting to get them signed off by auditors.



Under GAAP, if a public company has average gross receipts for the past three years of $26 million or less, they can then choose which accounting method they would like.


  Government Friendly  

For governments, it is a different story. The Government Accounting Standards Board (GASB), which is recognized as the official source of GAAP for state and local governments, establishes modified accrual accounting standards.



Modified accrual accounting is used and accepted by governmental agencies because they focus on current-year obligations. Governmental agencies have two key objectives: to report whether current-year revenues are sufficient enough to finance current-year expenses, and to demonstrate whether resources are being used according to legally adopted budgets.



Modified accrual accounting ticks those boxes. It enables government agencies to focus on short-term financial assets and liabilities. It also permits them to divide available funds into separate entities within the organization to ensure that money is being spent where it was intended.
What Is Modified Adjusted Gross Income (MAGI)?  

The term modified adjusted gross income (MAGI) refers to an individual's adjusted gross income (AGI) after taking into account certain allowable deductions and tax penalties.



It is an important number to understand since it can help reduce an individual's taxable income (to account for your retirement account contributions), factor in the eligibility for benefits like the student loan interest deduction and the Child Tax Credit, and establish eligibility for income-based Medicaid coverage or health insurance subsidies.

   Understanding Modified Adjusted Gross Income (MAGI)  

Modified adjusted gross income can be defined as your household’s AGI after any tax-exempt interest income and after factoring in certain tax deductions. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) uses MAGI to establish whether you qualify for certain tax benefits. MAGI notably determines:



Whether your income does not exceed the level that qualifies you to contribute to a Roth individual retirement account (IRA)
Whether you can deduct your traditional IRA contributions if you and/or your spouse have retirement plans, such as a 401(k) at work
Whether you’re eligible for the premium tax credit, which lowers your health insurance costs if you buy a plan through a state or federal Health Insurance Marketplace



You can contribute to a traditional IRA no matter how much you earn. In addition, you can typically deduct the IRA contribution amount, reducing your taxable income for that tax year. However, you can’t deduct contributions when you file your tax return if your MAGI exceeds limits set by the IRS and you and/or your spouse have a retirement plan at work.


   MAGI and Its Uses  

Your MAGI is an important figure, not only for understanding your taxable income but also for qualifying for certain tax credits or deductions. Several such credits and deductions have thresholds that look at your MAGI, not your unadjusted gross income. MAGIs above those thresholds will see those credits or deductions phase out or disappear.



MAGI is also used to determine eligibility for healthcare waivers and incentives under the Affordable Care Act (ACA) for states' health insurance marketplaces. It is also used as a threshold for qualifying for state Medicaid programs.


  Roth IRAs  

MAGI is also used to determine your eligibility to contribute to a Roth IRA. Roth accounts use after-tax dollars and grow tax-exempt (unlike traditional retirement accounts that are instead tax-deferred).



To contribute to a Roth IRA, your MAGI must be below the limits specified by the IRS. If you’re within the income threshold, the actual amount you can contribute is also determined by your MAGI. Your contributions are phased out if your MAGI exceeds the allowed limits.



Here’s a rundown of Roth IRA income limits for 2023:

  Traditional IRAs  

You have to remove the excess contributions if you contribute more than you’re allowed. Otherwise, you’ll face a tax penalty. Excess contributions are taxed at a rate of 6% per year for as long as the extra amount remains in your IRA.



Your MAGI and whether you and your spouse have retirement plans at work determine whether you can deduct traditional IRA contributions. If neither spouse is covered by a plan at work, then you can take the full deduction up to the amount of your contribution limit. However, if either spouse has a plan at work, then your deduction may be limited.

Tax laws are complicated and change periodically. If you need help figuring out your MAGI, or if you have any questions about IRA contribution and income limits, contact a trusted tax professional.






Many deductions are not commonly used, so your MAGI and AGI could be similar or identical.


   Calculating Your MAGI  

There are several different ways to calculate MAGI based on how MAGI is to be used. In the broadest sense, determining your MAGI is a three-step process. Additional ways to calculate MAGI for more specific reasons is in the subsequent section. In most cases, MAGI is calculated in three steps:



Figure out your gross income for the year.
Calculate your AGI.
Add back certain deductions to calculate your MAGI.


  Figure Out Your Gross Income  

Your gross income includes everything you earned during the year from:



Alimony, which is court-ordered payments to a spouse due to divorce or separation
Business income
Capital gains or any realized gains after selling an asset for a profit
Dividends, which are typically cash payments to a company’s shareholders
Interest
Farm income
Rental and royalty income
Retirement income
Tips
Wages



There are two scenarios in which alimony payments are not considered gross income. The first is if your divorce agreement was executed after 2018. The second is if your divorce agreement was executed before 2019 but later modified to expressly state that such payments are not deductible for the payer.






Your gross income appears on line 9 of Form 1040.


  Calculate Your AGI  

Your AGI is important because it’s the total taxable income calculated before itemized or standard deductions, exemptions, and credits are taken into account. It dictates how you can use various tax credits and exemptions.



Your AGI is equal to your gross income, minus certain tax-deductible expenses, including:



Certain business expenses for performing artists, reservists, and fee-basis government officials
Educator expenses
Half of any self-employment taxes
Health insurance premiums (if you’re self-employed)
Health Savings Account (HSA) contributions
Moving expenses for members of the armed forces moving due to active duty
Penalties on early withdrawal of savings
Retirement plan contributions (including IRAs and self-employed retirement plan contributions)
Student loan interest






You can do the math to figure out your AGI. Or you can find it on line 11 of Form 1040.


  Add Back Certain Deductions  

To find your MAGI, take your AGI and add back:



Any deductions you took for IRA contributions and taxable Social Security payments
Deductions you took for student loan interest
Tuition and fees deduction
Half of self-employment tax
Excluded foreign income
Interest from EE savings bonds used to pay for higher education expenses
Losses from a partnership
Passive income or loss
Rental losses
The exclusion for adoption expenses


   Various MAGI Calculations  

As mentioned earlier, MAGI is used to determine eligibility for certain tax benefits, subsidies, and assistance programs in a number of different ways. The specific calculations can vary depending on the context, as MAGI is used in different scenarios.



Below is a brief list of programs, taxes, or benefits that may each all for a MAGI calculation. However, the MAGI calculation will vary across each item. As you are asked to calculate MAGI for any tax credit or government program, be mindful you are aware of which MAGI calculation is required as not all formulas are the same. Several examples include but are not limited to:



IRA Deductions: Start with your AGI, then subtract any specific deductions related to traditional IRA contributions.Student Loan Interest Deduction: Start with your AGI, then add back any student loan interest deduction you claimed.Self-Employment Tax: Start with your AGI, then add back any specific deductions for self-employment taxes.Excluded Foreign Income: Start with your AGI, then add back any excluded foreign income.Other Tax-Exempt Income: Start with your AGI, then add back specific tax-exempt income such as income from municipal bonds.Social Security benefits: Start with your AGI, then add back a portion of your Social Security benefits (though often not all).




What Purpose Does MAGI Serve?
The IRS uses MAGI to determine whether you qualify for specific tax programs and benefits. For instance, it helps to determine the allowed amount of your Roth IRA contributions. Knowing your MAGI can also help you avoid tax penalties because over-contributing to these programs and others like them can trigger interest payments and fines. Your MAGI can also determine eligibility for certain government programs, such as the subsidized insurance plans available on the Health Insurance Marketplace.




What Is the Difference Between MAGI and AGI?
Your modified adjusted gross income (MAGI) is your adjusted gross income (AGI) plus additional items such as student loan interest, qualified education expenses, passive income or losses, IRA contributions, and foreign income, among others.




Can MAGI and AGI Be the Same?
Yes, MAGI and AGI can be the same. For many people, the list of deductions that need to be added back to AGI to calculate MAGI will not be relevant. For instance, those who did not earn any foreign income would have no reason to use that deduction and would have none of those earnings to add back to their AGI.


   The Bottom Line  

Modified adjusted gross income (MAGI) is important for your tax returns to determine what you owe the IRS. It takes your gross income and adjusts and modifies it for certain exemptions, qualifications, and allowances. Your MAGI will differ from your adjusted gross income (AGI) if you have foreign income, qualified education expenses, or passive losses, among other items.
What Is Modified Cash Basis?  

Modified cash basis is an accounting method that combines elements of the two primary bookkeeping practices: cash and accrual accounting. It seeks to get the best of both worlds, recording sales and expenses for long-term assets on an accrual basis and those of short-term assets on a cash basis. The goal here is to provide a clearer financial picture without dealing with the costs of switching to full-blown accrual accounting.





Key Takeaways

The modified cash basis is a bookkeeping practice that combines elements of the two major accounting methods: cash and accrual.Long-term assets are recorded on an accrual basis and short-term assets are registered using the cash accounting method.Accrual basis methods produce a clearer picture of business performance while using cash basis records for other items helps to keep costs down where possible.The modified cash method may only be used for internal purposes because it does not comply with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), or the generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Both IFRS and GAAP require that public companies use the accrual method of accounting for their financial statements, with some caveats for GAAP.


   Understanding Modified Cash Basis  

To understand how a modified cash basis works, it is first essential to break down how traditional bookkeeping practices are influenced by function.



Cash basis accounting recognizes income when it is received and expenses when they are paid for. Its most significant advantage is its simplicity.



In contrast, accrual accounting recognizes income when a sale is fulfilled rather than when it is paid for and records expenses incurred, irrespective of cash movement.



Accrual accounting is a slightly more complicated method. Still, it does benefit from enabling a company to match revenue and its associated expenses and understand what it costs to run the business each month and how much it makes.



The modified cash basis borrows elements from both cash and accrual accounting, depending on the nature of the asset. It consists of the following features:



It records short-term assets, such as accounts receivable (AR) and inventory, on a cash basis on the income statement, similar to cash basis accounting.
Longer-term assets, such as fixed assets and long-term debt, are recorded on the balance sheet. Like accrual accounting, depreciation and amortization appear on the income statement as well.


   Advantages and Disadvantages of Modified Cash Basis  
  Advantages  

The modified cash basis method can better balance short-term and long-term accounting items by borrowing elements from both techniques. Short-term items, like a regular monthly utility expense (a bill), are recorded according to the cash basis (as there is a related inflow or outflow of cash), which results in an income statement populated mainly with items based on the cash basis. Long-term items that do not change within a given financial year, such as a long-term investment property, plant, and equipment, are recorded using the accrual basis.



Accrual basis methods produce a clearer picture of business performance while using cash basis records for other items helps keep costs down where possible; maintaining a set of complete accrual accounting records is more time-consuming.


  Disadvantages  

If financial statements are subject to formal reviews, such as an analysis performed by auditors, investors, or a bank, the modified cash basis method will prove inadequate. The modified cash method may only be used for internal purposes because it does not comply with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) or the generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), which outline what procedures companies must follow when preparing their officially reported financial statements.



This makes a modified cash basis accounting popular with private companies. It also means that publicly traded companies using this method cannot get their financial statements signed off by auditors. Consistency is required, so transactions recorded on a cash basis must be converted to accrual. This is so because, under IFRS and GAAP, public companies are required to report their financials using only the accrual method of accounting because of its matching principle.



For tax reporting purposes, companies with average annual gross receipts of less than $25 million for the last three consecutive years may choose either the cash or accrual accounting method.
What Is a Modified Endowment Contract (MEC)?  

A modified endowment contract (MEC) is a cash value life insurance policy that has lost its tax benefits because it contains too much cash. Once the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) relabels your life insurance policy as an MEC, it loses the tax breaks for withdrawals and loans that you make from the policy. This permanent change can happen when you pay excess premiums in too short a period.



Permanent life insurance contracts in general are granted generous tax advantages in the U.S., but if you put too much cash into one, it loses its status as "insurance" and becomes an investment vehicle instead. The MEC limits for a policy will depend on its terms and death benefit amount. Your insurance company will warn you if a policy is about to become, or has become, an MEC.





Key Takeaways

A modified endowment contract (MEC) is a term for a cash value life insurance policy permanently denied tax benefits because it holds too much cash.IRS limits on the amount of cash in a policy are in place to avoid abusing the tax advantages available from permanent life insurance.A life insurance policy must fail to meet federal guidelines called the "seven-pay test" to be classed as an MEC.A major disadvantage posed by an MEC for most policyholders is that withdrawals are taxed and possibly penalized if early, similar to those taken from non-qualified annuities.MECs may be useful for some because they often offer a better low-risk yield than savings accounts do and can ease asset transfer upon the owner's death.

   Understanding Modified Endowment Contracts (MECs)  

A modified endowment contract comes about when the IRS no longer recognizes a policy as a life insurance contract because the total collected premiums and cash value exceed federal tax-law limits. The limit is set based on IRS rules about the maximum amount of premiums that can be paid into the policy in its first seven years. This classification seeks to combat the opportunity to call a financial product "life insurance" to avoid taxes.



In the 1970s, many life insurers took advantage of the tax-free growth of many of their products by offering policies that featured substantial cash value accumulation. Policyholders could withdraw interest and principal in the form of a tax-free loan, which made the policies de facto tax shelters. Federal legislation passed in 1988 limited this type of use.



Some life insurance policyholders, often high-net-worth individuals, choose to overfund a policy with a cash value component, then take periodic loans from it while living, effectively turning the policy into an investment. But doing this reduces the policy's death benefit for heirs. If your children are grown and your retirement resources are adequate, this approach may appeal but be aware of the cash value limits that might push your policy into MEC status.


  Criteria for an MEC, Including Seven-Pay Test  

Specifically, a life insurance policy is considered an MEC by the IRS if it meets three criteria:



The policy was entered into on or after June 20, 1988.
It must meet the statutory definition of a life insurance policy.
The policy must fail to meet the Technical and Miscellaneous Revenue Act of 1988 (TAMRA) "seven-pay test."






The IRS requires a life insurance policy to comply with a strict set of criteria to avoid becoming an MEC.



The seven-pay test determines whether the total amount of premiums paid into a life insurance policy within the first seven years is more than what you'd need to pay it up in full for those seven years. Policies become MECs when the premiums paid to the policy are more than what was needed to be paid within that seven-year time frame.



Life insurance policies entered into before June 20, 1988, aren't subject to restrictions on the payment of premiums over the money allowed under federal laws. However, the renewal of an older life insurance policy after this date is considered a new policy and must be subjected to the seven-pay test.


  Using a Paid-Up Additional (PUA) Rider to Avoid an MEC  

A life insurance policy can avoid triggering MEC status as long as the amount of cash held in the policy remains a certain amount below the death benefit amount (known as the corridor).



If you use a policy to accumulate cash value, one solution to avoid MEC status is to increase the death benefit through paid-up additional insurance (PUA), which raises the corridor's ceiling. PUA insurance is added whole life insurance coverage purchased with the policy’s dividends. It's like small packets of life insurance that are entirely paid for.


   Tax Implications of an MEC  

The cost basis within the MEC and withdrawals from one aren't subject to taxation. In the case of insurance, the cost basis equals the total amount you paid into an asset such as a permanent life insurance policy. It usually is figured as the premiums you paid. Any cash value balance above what you paid in premiums counts as your interest gains. (Northwestern cost basis citation)



Unlike traditional life insurance policies, taxes on gains are considered regular income for MEC withdrawals under last-in-first-out (LIFO) accounting methodology. This taxation of payouts is worse for an MEC policyholder because it provides for taxable interest to be distributed first, rather than the tax-free principal, as with first-in-first-out (FIFO) methodology (FIFO to LIFO citation.)



In addition, the taxation of withdrawals under an MEC is similar to that of non-qualified annuity withdrawals. For withdrawals before the age of 59 1/2, you may need to pay the IRS a premature withdrawal penalty of 10%.



Another serious drawback with an MEC is that it removes the tax benefits for policy loans. In a traditional life insurance policy, you can borrow your cash value, including your earnings above premiums paid, without owing income tax. In an MEC, taking out your gains through a loan counts as a taxable withdrawal. The 10% premature penalty also applies before the age of 59 1/2. Once again, loans operate under LIFO, so gains come out first. After you've taken out your gains, you could borrow the remaining cash value representing your premiums paid without owing taxes (Thrivent)



As with traditional life insurance policies, MEC death benefits aren't subject to taxation. Modified endowment contracts usually are purchased by individuals who are interested in tax-sheltered, investment-rich policies, and who don't intend to make pre-death policy withdrawals.



The tax-free death benefit makes MECs useful for estate-planning purposes, provided the estate can meet qualifying criteria. Furthermore, policy owners who don't take withdrawals can pass on a significant sum of money to their beneficiaries.


   Pros and Cons of MECs  



Pros

Offers higher yield on low-risk funds than some alternatives
Allows for smooth, tax-free asset transfer after the holder's death
Cash value can be borrowed against though taxes apply



Cons

Erases tax advantages for withdrawals and loans
Cash value in the policy becomes less accessible
Borrowing may reduce the death benefit for heirs





   Pros Explained  
  Higher Yield on Low-Risk Funds  

Some individuals may benefit from purchasing an MEC, even if not for life insurance, because it often offers a higher yield on effectively riskless money; a better return than savings accounts or certificates of deposit (CDs).


  Tax-Free Asset Transfer After Death  

MECs allow for the tax-free shifting of assets to beneficiaries, without probate proceedings, upon the owner's death.


  Can Be Borrowed Against  

MECs still provide a way to borrow against the cash value component, while living. However, taxes apply for taking out the policy earnings even through a loan.






A major downside of MECs is that once one is triggered, it can't be undone.


   Cons Explained  
  Lost Tax Advantages  

With an MEC, withdrawals and loans are taxed and possibly penalized if early, just like withdrawals from non-qualified annuities. However, death benefits remain tax-free.


  Cash Value Is Less Accessible  

The funds inside an MEC will become far less accessible than in a life insurance policy, partly because of the potential tax assessed on withdrawals and loans.


  Borrowing May Reduce Death Benefit  

While borrowing against the cash value may continue with an MEC, doing this will lower the amount of the eventual benefit paid to heirs at the policy owner's death.




How Are Taxes on Gains Figured in an MEC?
Taxes on gains are regular income for MEC withdrawals under last-in-first-out accounting methodology, meaning interest is disbursed before principal. However, the cost basis, or the total amount of premiums paid, in the MEC withdrawals aren't subject to taxation for withdrawals.




What Triggers an MEC?
An MEC is triggered if the amount of cash in a permanent life insurance policy exceeds the legal limits for it to be classified as insurance. The IRS uses a seven-pay test to determine MEC status. It looks at whether the premiums paid during the first seven years of the policy would exceed the amount for the policy to be paid up after seven years.




How Can You Avoid MEC Status?
A life insurance policy can avoid triggering MEC status as long as the amount of cash held in the policy remains beneath the required corridor below the death benefit. If you use a policy to accumulate cash value, one solution is to increase the death benefit through paid-up additional insurance (PUA), which raises the corridor's ceiling.




What Are the Likely Tax Consequences of an Early Withdrawal Under an MEC?
Withdrawals are taxed similarly to those of a non-qualified annuity. For withdrawals before the age of 59½, a penalty of 10% may apply. As with traditional life insurance policies, MEC death benefits aren't subject to taxation.




Is a Modified Endowment Contract a Good Thing?
Generally speaking, converting a life insurance policy to an MEC isn't good. This is because the MEC loses many of its prior tax advantages in place when it was classified as life insurance. However, purposefully creating an MEC can be an estate planning tool under certain circumstances.


   The Bottom Line  

An MEC is a cash value life insurance policy that has been stripped of its tax benefits because it contains too much cash. Once reclassified by the IRS as an MEC, the policy's withdrawals and loans are taxed. It's a permanent change and usually disadvantageous for most policyholders, but MECs may be useful for some because they provide higher low-risk yields than savings accounts and can ease the transfer of assets upon the owner's death.

What Is the Modified Dietz Method?  

The modified Dietz method is a way to measure a portfolio's historical return that is based on a weighted calculation of its cash flow. The method takes into account the timing of cash flows and assumes that there is a constant rate of return over a specified period of time.



The modified Dietz method is considered to be more accurate than the simple Dietz method, which assumes that all cash flows come from the middle of the period of time being evaluated.


   Understanding the Modified Dietz Method  

The modified Dietz method is considered an accurate reflection of an individual's personal rate of return from an investment. It takes into account the market value of the holdings at the beginning of a period; its market value at the end of the period; all cash flows during that period, and the length of time that each cash flow event was maintained in the account.





Key Takeaways

The modified Dietz method is now widely used by investment companies in reporting results to clients.It is considered a more accurate reflection of the individual's rate of return.The method excludes external factors that could otherwise skew the numbers.Cash flow, in this case, can be contributions, withdrawals, or fees.



The number achieved by using the modified Dietz method is sometimes called the modified internal rate of return (MIRR), which is a metric often used in capital budgeting decisions.



Whatever its use, the point of measuring internal rate of return is to exclude external factors that could skew the results.


  Why This Method Was Adopted  

Financial industry watchdogs and investors are increasingly seeking greater transparency into how investment returns are calculated and reported. The modified Dietz method is widely recognized as a step toward improved investment portfolio attribution reporting, and it is now commonly used in the investment management industry.






The result of using the modified Dietz method is sometimes referred to as the modified internal rate of return.



The method is a dollar-weighted analysis of a portfolio's return. That makes it is a more accurate way to measure the return on a portfolio than the simpler geometric return method, though it can run into problems during periods of heavy volatility or if there are multiple cash flows within a particular period.



This approach to return calculation is similar to the dollar-weighted return method but has the advantage of not requiring its solver to find the exact rate of return.



The method is named after Peter O. Dietz, an academic and author of influential works during the 1960s on measuring the returns of pension fund investments. His original idea was to find a quicker way of calculating an IRR than the methods that were then available, which relied on computers that were primitive by today's standards.



Today, it's relatively easy to calculate a true time-weighted return by calculating a daily return and geometrically linking to get a return for a month, a quarter, or any other time period. However, the modified Dietz method remains useful because of its performance attribution calculation benefits, which are unavailable with time-weighted calculation methods.



This method for return calculation is a signature of modern portfolio management. It is one of the methodologies of calculating returns recommended by the Investment Performance Council (IPC) as part of their Global Investment Performance Standards (GIPS). These standards are intended to provide consistency in the way portfolio returns are calculated internationally.
What Is Modified Duration?  

Modified duration is a formula that expresses the measurable change in the value of a security in response to a change in interest rates. Modified duration follows the concept that interest rates and bond prices move in opposite directions. This formula is used to determine the effect that a 100-basis-point (1%) change in interest rates will have on the price of a bond.





Key Takeaways

Modified duration measures the change in the value of a bond in response to a change in 100-basis-point (1%) change in interest rates.Modified duration is an extension of the Macaulay duration, and in order to calculate modified duration, the Macaulay duration must first be calculated.Macaulay duration calculates the weighted average time before a bondholder receives the bond's cash flows.As a bond's maturity increases, duration increases, and as a bond's coupon and interest rate increases, its duration decreases.

Modified duration is an extension of the Macaulay duration, which allows investors to measure the sensitivity of a bond to changes in interest rates. Macaulay duration calculates the weighted average time before a bondholder receives the bond's cash flows. In order to calculate modified duration, the Macaulay duration must first be calculated.

Here, (PV) * (CF) is the present value of a coupon at period t, and T is equal to the time to each cash flow in years. This calculation is performed and summed for the number of periods to maturity.


   What Modified Duration Can Tell You  

Modified duration measures the average cash-weighted term to maturity of a bond. It is a very important number for portfolio managers, financial advisors, and clients to consider when selecting investments because—all other risk factors equal—bonds with higher durations have greater price volatility than bonds with lower durations. There are many types of duration, and all components of a bond, such as its price, coupon, maturity date, and interest rates, are used to calculate duration.



Here are some principles of duration to keep in mind. First, as maturity increases, duration increases and the bond becomes more volatile. Second, as a bond's coupon increases, its duration decreases and the bond becomes less volatile. Third, as interest rates increase, duration decreases, and the bond's sensitivity to further interest rate increases goes down.


   Example of How to Use Modified Duration  

Assume a $1,000 bond has a three-year maturity, pays a 10% coupon, and that interest rates are 5%. This bond, following the basic bond pricing formula would have a market price of:

Macaulay Duration​=($95.24×$1,136.161​)+($90.70×$1,136.162​)+($950.22×$1,136.163​)=2.753​



This result shows that it takes 2.753 years to recoup the true cost of the bond. With this number, it is now possible to calculate the modified duration.



To find the modified duration, all an investor needs to do is take the Macaulay duration and divide it by 1 + (yield-to-maturity / number of coupon periods per year). In this example that calculation would be 2.753 / (1.05 / 1), or 2.62%. This means that for every 1% movement in interest rates, the bond in this example would inversely move in price by 2.62%.
What Is a Modified Gross Lease?  

A modified gross lease is a type of real estate rental agreement where the tenant pays base rent at the lease's inception, but it takes on a proportional share of some of the other costs associated with the property as well, such as property taxes, utilities, insurance, and maintenance.



Modified gross leases are typically used for commercial spaces such as office buildings, where there is more than one tenant. This type of lease typically falls between a gross lease, where the landlord pays for operating expenses, and a net lease, which passes on property expenses to the tenant.



All agreements should be carefully reviewed by both parties. Even if the lease uses common terminology, it should be treated as though it's a unique document for your own situation.





Key Takeaways

Modified gross leases are rental agreements where the tenant pays base rent at the lease's inception as well as a proportional share of other costs like utilities.Other costs related to the property, such as maintenance and upkeep, are generally the responsibility of the landlord.Modified gross leases are common in the commercial real estate industry, especially office spaces, where there is more than one tenant.


   How a Modified Gross Lease Works  

Commercial real estate leases can be categorized by two rent calculation methods: gross and net. The modified gross lease—at times referred to as a modified net lease—is a combination of a gross lease and a net lease.



Modified gross leases are a hybrid of these two leases, as operating expenses are both the landlord's and the tenant's responsibility. With a modified gross lease, the tenant takes over expenses directly related to his or her unit, including unit maintenance and repairs, utilities, and janitorial costs, while the owner/landlord continues to pay for the other operating expenses.



The extent of each party’s responsibility is negotiated in the terms of the lease. Which expenses the tenant is responsible for can vary significantly from property to property, so a prospective tenant must ensure that a modified gross lease clearly defines which expenses are the tenant’s responsibility. For example, under a modified gross lease, a property's tenants may be required to pay their proportional share of an office tower's total heating expense.


   When Modified Gross Leases Are Common  

Modified gross leases are common when multiple tenants occupy an office building. In a building with a single meter where the monthly electric bill is $1,000, the cost would be split evenly between the tenants. If there are 10 renters, they each pay $100. Or, each may pay a proportional share of the electric bill based on the percentage of the building’s total square footage that the tenant’s unit occupies. Alternatively, if each unit has its own meter, each tenant pays the exact electrical expense it incurs, whether $50 or $200.



The landlord may generally pay other costs related to the building under a modified gross lease such as taxes and insurance.


   Pros and Cons of Modified Gross Leases  

Like any other business transaction, there are both pros and cons to modified gross leases for tenants and landlords.


  Tenants  

Since maintenance and other related costs are borne by the landlord, the tenant stands to benefit. The tenant has more control over budgeting for costs directly related to its business including rent, business taxes, salaries, etc. But if the landlord is lax in general maintenance, this may be a problem for tenants, especially those who rely on the appearance of their office or retail space to allure and retain clients.


  Landlords  

By using a gross modified lease, landlords can rest assured their property is maintained to the degree they see fit, especially since some tenants may not be as reliable when it comes to doing repairs or improvements such as maintaining the exterior space. One disadvantage, though, is undervaluing the operating costs. So a landlord may be in trouble if the rent they charge is too little for a space that requires a lot of upkeep.


   Gross and Net Leases  
  Gross Lease  

Under a gross lease, the owner/landlord covers all the property’s operating expenses including real estate taxes, property insurance, structural and exterior maintenance and repairs, common area maintenance and repairs, unit maintenance and repairs, utilities, and janitorial costs.



Landlords who issue gross leases typically calculate a rental amount that covers the cost of rent and other expenses such as utilities, and/or maintenance. The amount payable is normally issued as a flat fee, which the tenant pays to the landlord each month for the exclusive use of the property. This can be beneficial for a tenant because it allows them to budget properly, especially when they have limited resources.


  Net Lease  

A net lease, on the other hand, is more common in single-tenant buildings and passes the responsibility of property expenses through to the tenant. Net leases are generally used in conjunction with tenants like national restaurant chains.



Many commercial real estate investors who purchase properties, but don't want the aggravation that comes with ownership, tend to use net leases. Because they pass on the costs associated with the building—insurance, maintenance, property taxes—to the tenant through a net lease, most landlords will charge a lower amount of rent.




What Is the Difference Between a Gross Lease, Modified Gross Lease and Net Lease?
Gross lease is where the landlord pays for operating expenses, while a net lease means the tenant takes on the property expenses. A modified gross lease means that the operative expenses are borne by the tenant and the landlord.




Is Modified Gross or Net Lease Better?
Investors prefer net lease properties due to property expenses being the responsibility of the Tenants. If a Landlord has Gross Leases or Modified Gross Leases with Tenants, this can make it more difficult to sell the property as an investment.




When Is a Modified Gross Lease Used?
Modified gross leases are common when multiple tenants occupy an office building. The tenants will split utility bills, but the landlord will generally pay other costs related to the building under a modified gross lease such as taxes and insurance.


   The Bottom Line  

Modified gross leases are rental agreements where the tenant pays base rent at the lease's inception as well as a proportional share of other costs like utilities. A gross lease is where the landlord pays for operating expenses, while a net lease means the tenant takes on the property expenses. Other costs related to the property, such as maintenance and upkeep, are generally the responsibility of the landlord.



Modified gross leases are common in the commercial real estate industry, especially office spaces, where there is more than one tenant.
What Is Modified Internal Rate of Return (MIRR)?  

The modified internal rate of return (MIRR) assumes that positive cash flows are reinvested at the firm's cost of capital and that the initial outlays are financed at the firm's financing cost. By contrast, the traditional internal rate of return (IRR) assumes the cash flows from a project are reinvested at the IRR itself. The MIRR, therefore, more accurately reflects the cost and profitability of a project.


   Formula and Calculation of MIRR

Meanwhile, the internal rate of return (IRR) is a discount rate that makes the net present value (NPV) of all cash flows from a particular project equal to zero. Both MIRR and IRR calculations rely on the formula for NPV.





Key Takeaways

MIRR improves on IRR by assuming that positive cash flows are reinvested at the firm's cost of capital.MIRR is used to rank investments or projects a firm or investor may undertake.MIRR is designed to generate one solution, eliminating the issue of multiple IRRs.












Investopedia / Julie Bang


   What MIRR Can Tell You  

The MIRR is used to rank investments or projects of unequal size. The calculation is a solution to two major problems that exist with the popular IRR calculation. The first main problem with IRR is that multiple solutions can be found for the same project. The second problem is that the assumption that positive cash flows are reinvested at the IRR is considered impractical in practice. With the MIRR, only a single solution exists for a given project, and the reinvestment rate of positive cash flows is much more valid in practice.



The MIRR allows project managers to change the assumed rate of reinvested growth from stage to stage in a project. The most common method is to input the average estimated cost of capital, but there is flexibility to add any specific anticipated reinvestment rate.


   The Difference Between MIRR and IRR  

Even though the internal rate of return (IRR) metric is popular among business managers, it tends to overstate the profitability of a project and can lead to capital budgeting mistakes based on an overly optimistic estimate. The modified internal rate of return (MIRR) compensates for this flaw and gives managers more control over the assumed reinvestment rate from future cash flow.



An IRR calculation acts like an inverted compounding growth rate. It has to discount the growth from the initial investment in addition to reinvested cash flows. However, the IRR does not paint a realistic picture of how cash flows are actually pumped back into future projects.



Cash flows are often reinvested at the cost of capital, not at the same rate at which they were generated in the first place. IRR assumes that the growth rate remains constant from project to project. It is very easy to overstate potential future value with basic IRR figures.



Another major issue with IRR occurs when a project has different periods of positive and negative cash flows. In these cases, the IRR produces more than one number, causing uncertainty and confusion. MIRR solves this issue as well.


   The Difference Between MIRR and FMRR  

The financial management rate of return (FMRR) is a metric most often used to evaluate the performance of a real estate investment and pertains to a real estate investment trust (REIT). The modified internal rate of return (MIRR) improves on the standard internal rate of return (IRR) value by adjusting for differences in the assumed reinvestment rates of initial cash outlays and subsequent cash inflows. FMRR takes things a step further by specifying cash outflows and cash inflows at two different rates known as the “safe rate” and the “reinvestment rate.”



Safe rate assumes that funds required to cover negative cash flows are earning interest at a rate easily attainable and can be withdrawn when needed at a moment’s notice (i.e., within a day of account deposit). In this instance, a rate is “safe” because the funds are highly liquid and safely available with minimal risk when needed.



The reinvestment rate includes a rate to be received when positive cash flows are reinvested in a similar intermediate or long-term investment with comparable risk. The reinvestment rate is higher than the safe rate because it is not liquid (i.e., it pertains to another investment) and thus requires a higher-risk discount rate.


   Limitations of Using MIRR  

The first limitation of MIRR is that it requires you to compute an estimate of the cost of capital in order to make a decision, a calculation that can be subjective and vary depending on the assumptions made.



As with IRR, the MIRR can provide information that leads to sub-optimal decisions that do not maximize value when several investment options are being considered at once. MIRR does not actually quantify the various impacts of different investments in absolute terms; NPV often provides a more effective theoretical basis for selecting investments that are mutually exclusive. It may also fail to produce optimal results in the case of capital rationing.



MIRR can also be difficult to understand for people who do not have a financial background. Moreover, the theoretical basis for MIRR is also disputed among academics.


   Example of How to Use MIRR  

A basic IRR calculation is as follows. Assume that a two-year project with an initial outlay of $195 and a cost of capital of 12% will return $121 in the first year and $131 in the second year. To find the IRR of the project so that the net present value (NPV) = 0 when IRR = 18.66%:

NPV=0=−195+(1+IRR)121​+(1+IRR)2131​﻿



To calculate the MIRR of the project, assume that the positive cash flows will be reinvested at the 12% cost of capital. Therefore, the future value of the positive cash flows when t = 2 is computed as:

Next, divide the future value of the cash flows by the present value of the initial outlay, which was $195, and find the geometric return for two periods. Finally, adjust this ratio for the time period using the formula for MIRR, given:

In this particular example, the IRR gives an overly optimistic picture of the potential of the project, while the MIRR gives a more realistic evaluation of the project.
What Is the Modigliani-Miller Theorem (M&M)?  

The Modigliani-Miller theorem (M&M) states that the market value of a company is correctly calculated as the present value of its future earnings and its underlying assets, and is independent of its capital structure.



At its most basic level, the theorem argues that, with certain assumptions in place, it is irrelevant whether a company finances its growth by borrowing, by issuing stock shares, or by reinvesting its profits.



Developed in the 1950s, the theory has had a significant impact on corporate finance.


   Understanding the Modigliani-Miller Theorem  

Companies have only three ways to raise money to finance their operations and fuel their growth and expansion. They can borrow money by issuing bonds or obtaining loans; they can re-invest their profits in their operations, or they can issue new stock shares to investors.












Investopedia / Candra Huff



The Modigliani-Miller theorem argues that the option or combination of options that a company chooses has no effect on its real market value.



Merton Miller, one of the two originators of the theorem, explains the concept behind the theory with an analogy in his book, Financial Innovations and Market Volatility:



"Think of the firm as a gigantic tub of whole milk. The farmer can sell the whole milk as is. Or he can separate out the cream and sell it at a considerably higher price than the whole milk would bring. (That's the analog of a firm selling low-yield and hence high-priced debt securities.) But, of course, what the farmer would have left would be skim milk with low butterfat content and that would sell for much less than whole milk. That corresponds to the levered equity. The M and M proposition says that if there were no costs of separation (and, of course, no government dairy-support programs), the cream plus the skim milk would bring the same price as the whole milk."


  History of the M&M Theory  

Merton Miller and Franco Modigliani conceptualized and developed this theorem, and published it in an article, "The Cost of Capital, Corporation Finance and the Theory of Investment," which appeared in the American Economic Review in the late 1950s.





Key Takeaways

The Modigliani-Miller theorem states that a company's capital structure is not a factor in its value.Market value is determined by the present value of future earnings, the theorem states.The theorem has been highly influential since it was introduced in the 1950s.







At the time, both Modigliani and Miller were professors at the Graduate School of Industrial Administration at Carnegie Mellon University. Both were required to teach corporate finance to business students but, unhappily, neither had any experience in corporate finance. After reading the course materials that they were to use, the two professors found the information inconsistent and the concepts flawed. So, they worked together to correct them.


  Later Additions  

The result was the groundbreaking article published in the economic journal. The information was eventually compiled and organized to become the M&M theorem.



Early on, the two economists realized that their initial theorem left out a number of relevant factors. It left out such matters as taxes and financing costs, effectively arguing its point in the vacuum of a "perfectly efficient market."



Later versions of their theorem addressed these issues, including "Corporate Income Taxes and the Cost of Capital: A Correction," published in the 1960s.
What Is Modus Operandi (M.O.)?  

Modus operandi is a Latin term used in English-speaking circles to describe an individual's or group's habitual way of operating, which forms a discernible pattern. The term is primarily used when discussing criminal behavior, but it is not exclusively uttered in this context. Modus operandi can also be defined as a specific method of operation.



For example, military strategists refer to an enemy's modus operandi when predicting the next threatening move in an armed conflict. Synonymous with the term "operating mode," modus operandi is routinely shortened to the initials "M.O.," in both written and verbal usage.





Key Takeaways

The term "modus operandi" is a Latin term that describes an individual or group's habitual way of operating, which represents a discernible pattern.A modus operandi (commonly abbreviated as "M.O.") is mainly used to discuss criminal behavior and is often used by professionals to prevent future crimes.Modi operandi may change over time, particularly by adapting to experiences as well as changing values.Studying patterns, not just those of criminals, can aid individuals who study and pay attention to them, such as investors.


   Understanding Modus Operandi  

Groups of people or different societies often exhibit thought patterns or behavioral patterns that are specific to those cultures. These M.O.s may vary widely across cultural or geographic boundaries. Furthermore, M.O.s are fluid, in that they may change as values evolve or as demographic breakdowns shift within a particular society.



Individuals also often behave in the same way that they have done before, exhibiting similar patterns throughout their lifetime. Studying individuals and their decisions over time can lead one to predict an individual or business's next move.



For example, Warren Buffett has stuck to a similar investing pattern his whole life, which he has made well known through speaking engagements, interviews, and books he has written. If one were to study all of this material and eventually understand Buffett's investing M.O., they would be able to guess his investing moves in certain economic conditions and perhaps apply the same strategies to their own portfolios.



M.O., however, is most often attributed to criminals and crime syndicates and used to stop crime. Investigators, the FBI, and police organizations can utilize patterns in preventing crime and apprehending those that have or seek to commit it.


   Utilizing Modus Operandi  

An enemy's M.O. can be used by security experts to prevent an attack while it's still in the preparation stages. Known as "predictive profiling," this behavior is an extension of an M.O. that was developed by Israeli security forces in an effort to predict terrorist behavior, based on observing a group's or an individual's behavioral patterns.



Predictive profiling is successful after observing potential threats, examining situations or objects surrounding said threats, and developing an operational profile. Security forces then use the operational profile to predict the next threat. If a person regularly meets with a known criminal element, at a certain house, at a particular time of day, the operational profile may predict the time and location of that person's next visit.



Predictive profiling's logical conclusion is the prevention of a crime. Undercover security forces may confront criminal personalities at locations far from their houses to gather more information. If someone who poses a threat comes face to face with an authoritarian figure, they may become too scared to execute their intended criminal activity.


   Modus Operandi in Business  

When a company is operating at "business as usual" it is in its modus operandi. For investors and other stakeholders, this means stability. In this state, employees are carrying out their routines, customers are making purchases, and vendors are being paid.



Disruptions to the modus operandi instead introduce question marks and increases volatility. Predictions and forecasts are harder to make when the modus operandi is interrupted, and losses may be incurred as a result.



Modus operandi can also be taken with a negative connotation in business. If a company is merely operating habitually, it cannot grow, innovate, and adapt. As such, there needs to be a balance between maintaining "business as usual" and seeking new opportunities.






Businesses can utilize predictive profiling to identify potential customer segments and create targeted advertising and marketing campaigns based on their M.O.s.


   Examples of Modus Operandi  

As an example, a Ponzi scheme's M.O. involves taking money from new investors and using it to pay off existing investors, to create the appearance that the latter group of individuals is drawing impressive returns on their capital investments.



A straight-A student's M.O. might be to complete homework assignments before they are due, achieve a perfect attendance record, and visit with professors weekly during their office hours.



An individual's daily routine may be considered an M.O. where someone follows the same order of activities, in an effort to regulate their lifestyles and live as efficiently as possible. M.O.s may also apply to business protocol. For example, when meeting a new contact, an M.O. might be to shake hands and make eye contact in order to establish a connection.




What Does Modus Operandi Mean?
Modus operandi is Latin, where it may be translated literally as "way of operating."




What Is the Abbreviation for Modus Operandi?
Modus operandi is sometimes abbreviated as M.O. Therefore, one's M.O. refers to their usual patterns of behaviors or habits.




Does the Word Modus Operandi Have a Negative Connotation?
Modus operandi, or M.O. was popularized in the context of criminal investigations. Suspects could be identified and captured based on understanding their usual habits, hangouts, and contacts. Because of that, the phrase may still carry negative connotations. That said, a modus operandi can also be neutral or even positive when used to describe non-criminal activities.


   The Bottom Line  

Modus operandi refers to the typical patterns of behavior, interactions, and locales of an individual or organization. From the Latin, meaning "way of operating" modus operandi can be used to predict outcomes based on these patterns of behavior and has been used by law enforcement and regulators to identify criminal activities. Predictive profiling can also be used by businesses to identify potential customer segments and create targeted advertising and marketing campaigns.
What Is a Mom-and-Pop Establishment?  

“Mom-and-pop” is a colloquial term used to describe a small, family-owned, or independent business. Mom-and-pop stores are often operations that struggle to compete with more substantial establishments, such as big-box retailers, which generally boast more buying power than smaller players. In the last few years “shop local” and “shop small” have been used as slogans in marketing campaigns to support these smaller establishments. The term “mom-and-pop” can also refer to inexperienced investors who casually play the market.





Key Takeaways

The popularity of mom-and-pop stores is on the rise, thanks in part to shoppers seeking boutique services or products.Traditional mom-and-pop businesses, such as bookstores and pharmacies, have found it financially difficult to compete with large chain stores and online behemoths like Amazon.Mom-and-pop businesses benefit from local consumers who choose to pump their money into their communities to promote local economic growth.


   Understanding Mom-and-Pop Entities  

Mom-and-pop stores historically were local family-owned-and-operated general stores or drugstores. Today, mom-and-pop establishments are synonymous with various different types of businesses, including restaurants, bookstores, automotive repair shops, and insurance agencies.



In many ways mom-and-pop businesses stand at a steep disadvantage to large corporations, e-commerce companies, technology platforms, and franchise businesses, which enjoy bigger economies of scale, greater access to capital for investments, larger advertising budgets, higher brand awareness, and greater access to talent pools for hiring. This collectively gives larger players a an edge over mom-and-pop businesses, which frequently lose ground and find themselves driven out of business when forced to compete.



Fortunately, there are signs of hope for mom-and-pop stores. More than ever before, consumers are demanding more-personalized products and services. When shoppers ask, “Where can I find a mom-and-pop shop near me?,” they don’t need to look any further than the internet. Small businesses can expand their target audience and broaden their geographical reach through the use of e-commerce and social media.



Mom-and-pop shops also benefit from a phenomenon known as “Small Business Saturday,” which was founded by American Express in 2010 and is cosponsored by the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA). The idea was to encourage shopping locally on the Saturday following Thanksgiving, and it appears to have worked. U.S. consumers spent an estimated $17.9 billion at independent retailers and restaurants on Small Business Saturday in 2022.



This shopping holiday was established in response to Black Friday, when large retailers offer enticing discounts to consumers on the day after Thanksgiving. Mom-and-pop business owners tend to have a vested interest in the community, its citizens, and the local economy. Consequently, they offer highly interactive and personalized services that large corporations cannot replicate. For this reason mom-and-pop stores often win increased brand loyalty among consumers.






Mom-and-pop drugstores are typically owned and operated by the same family for generations, where the druggist or pharmacist would also be the proprietor of the store.


   Mom-and-Pop Investors vs. Mom-and-Pop Establishments  

“Mom-and-pop” is also used to refer to inexperienced investors who minimally invest in the stock market. Despite limited capital commitments, mom-and-pop investors often count on significant returns on their trades in order to supplement their income.



However, many mom-and-pop investors are unfamiliar with market research and so react impulsively to market changes and fluctuations. They rashly dump their positions rather than riding out rough patches. Some mom-and-pop investors combat their inexperience by hiring brokers to facilitate trades or using one of the many online trading platforms to place their investments.






National Mom and Pop Business Owners Day is March 29. The holiday was founded by Rick and Margie Segel in 1939 as a way to honor the hat shop started by their parents that year.




What Is a Mom-and-Pop Store?
A mom-and-pop store is a small, often family-owned-and-operated business that maximizes its profits by providing personalized, interactive services for its customers, curating its inventory to fit a local need. Examples include bookstores, grocery stores, delicatessens, bakeries, restaurants, auto repair shops, insurance agencies, gift shops, ice cream emporiums, butcher shops, clothing boutiques, drug stores, card shops, and more.




What Does It Cost to Open a Mom-and-Pop Store?
There is no one set cost to open a mom-and-pop store. However, the online management platform BlueCart says that it takes somewhere between $25,000 and $50,000 to open a small mom-and-pop grocery store.




How Many Mom-and-Pop Stores Are There in the U.S.?
According to the U.S. Census Bureau, there were 7,936,977 small business establishments in the United States in 2019, with a small business establishment being defined as one that employs fewer than 500 people and operates at a single location.


   The Bottom Line  

Small businesses are an important part of the U.S. economy, and mom-and-pop stores are a bedrock subset of them. They inspire brand loyalty and, if successful, develop a devoted local clientele. When the term is applied to financial investors, it means people with limited knowledge of the stock market who nevertheless invest in small amounts as a way to boost their income.
What Is Momentum?  

Momentum is the rate of acceleration of a security's price—that is, the speed at which the price is changing. Momentum trading is a strategy that seeks to capitalize on momentum to enter a trend as it is picking up steam.



Simply put, momentum refers to the inertia of a price trend to continue either rising or falling for a particular length of time, usually taking into account both price and volume information. In technical analysis, momentum is often measured via an oscillator and is used to help identify trends.





Key Takeaways

Momentum, finance, refers to the capacity for a price trend to sustain itself going forward.Strong momentum can continue in an upward or downward trend, which can be confirmed by changes in trading volume and other technical indicators.Momentum investing is a trading strategy in which investors buy securities that are rising and sell them when they look to have peaked.Momentum trading therefore describes a herding strategy, following others; but price trends are never guaranteed in the future.


   Understanding Momentum  

Think of it as the momentum of a train: When a train starts up, as it accelerates, it moves very slowly. Once it gets up to speed, it stops accelerating but remains traveling at a higher velocity. At the end of the trip, the train decelerates as it slows down, but it can take many miles of track to apply the brakes before finally coming to a complete stop. For the momentum investor, the best part of the train ride is in the middle, when the train is moving at its highest velocity.



Momentum investors like to chase performance. They attempt to achieve alpha returns by investing in stocks that trend one way or another. Stocks trending up are referred to as hot stocks. Some are hotter than others (as measured by growth over a period of time). A stock that is trending down is cold.



Investors can use momentum as a trading technique that seeks to profit from the herding behavior of market psychology. Rather than "buy low, sell high", momentum trading follows a strategy of "buy high, sell higher". Once a momentum trader sees acceleration in a stock's price, earnings, or revenues, the trader will often take a long or short position in the stock in the hope that its momentum will continue in either an upward or downward direction. This strategy relies on short-term movements in a stock's price rather than fundamental value.



When applied, an investor can buy or sell based on the strength of the trends in an asset's price. If a trader wants to use a momentum-based strategy, he takes a long position in a stock or asset that has been trending up. If the stock is trending down, he takes a short position. Instead of the traditional philosophy of trading—buy low, sell high—momentum investing seeks to sell low and buy lower, or buy high and sell higher. Instead of identifying the continuation or reversal pattern, momentum investors focus on the trend created by the most recent price break.


   Special Considerations  
  Momentum Tools  

Some tools for momentum investors help to define the trend, such as the trend line. A trend line is a line drawn from the high price to the low price, or vice versa, over a given time period. If the line is up, the trend is up and the momentum investor buys the stock. If the trend line is down, the trend is down and the momentum investor sells the stock.



In this way, momentum investing is purely a technical indicator. Though "momentum" can refer to fundamental measures of performance, such as revenue and earnings, it is most commonly used in reference to historical asset prices as a technical indicator.


  Disadvantages of Momentum Trading  

Just like any other trading style, there are risks that come with momentum trading. By using this technique, you should know that you are trading on the backs of other people in the market, and price trends are never guaranteed. And always be prepared for unexpected reversals or corrections that take place. This can happen because of unexpected news or changes in investor sentiment in the market.
What Is Momentum Investing?  

Momentum investing is a strategy that aims to capitalize on the continuance of an existing market trend. It is a trading strategy in which investors buy securities that are already rising and look to sell them when they look to have peaked



Momentum, in markets, refers to the capacity for a price trend to sustain itself going forward.





Key Takeaways

Momentum investing is a strategy that aims to capitalize on the continuance of existing trends in the market.Market momentum is the ability for a price trend to sustain itself and continue.Momentum investing usually involves a strict set of rules based on technical indicators that dictate market entry and exit points for particular securities.Few professional investment managers make use of momentum investing, relying instead on fundamental factors and value indicators.


   Understanding Momentum Investing  

Momentum investing involves going long on stocks, futures, market exchange-traded funds (ETFs), or any financial instrument showing upward-trending prices and short the respective assets with downward-trending prices.



Momentum investing holds that trends can persist for some time and that it’s possible to profit by staying with a trend until its conclusion, no matter how long that may be. For example, momentum investors that entered the U.S. stock market in 2009 generally enjoyed an uptrend until December 2018.






Although he wasn't the first to use the strategy, fund manager and businessman Richard Driehaus is often credited as being the father of momentum investing.


   Momentum Investing Methods  

Momentum investing usually involves abiding by a strict set of rules based on technical indicators that dictate market entry and exit points for particular securities.



Momentum investors sometimes use two longer-term moving averages (MAs), one a bit shorter than the other, for trading signals. Some use 50-day and 200-day MAs, for example. In this case, the 50-day crossing above the 200-day creates a buy signal, while a 50-day crossing back below the 200-day creates a sell signal. A few momentum investors prefer to use even longer-term MAs for signaling purposes.



Another type of momentum investing strategy involves following price-based signals to go long on sector ETFs with the strongest momentum, while shorting the sector ETFs with the weakest momentum, then rotating in and out of the sectors accordingly.



Other momentum strategies involve cross-asset analysis. For example, some equity traders closely watch the Treasury yield curve and use it as a momentum signal for equity entries and exits. A 10-year Treasury yield above the two-year yield generally is a buy signal, whereas a two-year yield trading above the 10-year yield is a sell signal. Notably, the two-year versus 10-year Treasury yields tend to be a strong predictor of recessions, and also has implications for stock markets.



In addition, some strategies involve both momentum factors and some fundamental factors. One such system is CAN SLIM, made famous by William O’Neill, founder of Investor’s Business Daily. Since it emphasizes quarterly and annual earnings per share (EPS), some may argue it’s not a momentum strategy, per se. However, the system generally seeks stocks with both earnings and sales momentum and tends to point to stocks with price momentum, as well.






If you intend to practice momentum investing, make sure you choose the proper securities and consider their liquidity and trading volume.



Like other momentum systems, CAN SLIM also includes rules for when to enter and exit stocks, based mainly on technical analysis.


   The Debate Over Momentum Investing  

Few professional investment managers make use of momentum investing, believing that individual stock picking based on an analysis of discounted cash flows (DCFs) and other fundamental factors tend to produce more predictable results, and is a better means of beating index performance over the long term. "As an investment strategy, it’s a thumb in the eye of the efficient market hypothesis (EMH), one of the central tenets of modern finance," to quote a UCLA Anderson Review article, "Momentum Investing: It Works, But Why?"



However, momentum investing has its advocates. A 1993 study published in the Journal of Finance documented how strategies of buying recent stock winners and selling recent losers generated significantly higher near-term returns than the U.S. market overall from 1965 to 1989.



More recently, the American Association of Individual Investors (AAII) found that CAN SLIM can beat the S&P 500 when looking at trailing five-year and 10-year periods, and has beaten it soundly over an even longer time frame.




What Technical Indicators Can Momentum Traders Use?
There are several momentum indicators that technical analysts can use in momentum trading. Among the most popular include the relative strength indicator (RSI), price rate of change (ROC), stochastics, and moving average convergence divergence (MACD).




What Is the Formula For Market Momentum?
Generally, market momentum can be defined from the following equation:M=V−Vxwhere:V=The latest priceVx=The closing price x number of days ago\begin{aligned} &M = V - V_x\\ &\textbf{where:}\\ &V = \text{The latest price}\\ &V_x = \text{The closing price }x\text{ number of days ago}\\ \end{aligned}​M=V−Vx​where:V=The latest priceVx​=The closing price x number of days ago​




What Is the Market Psychology Behind Momentum Trading?
Momentum traders benefit from herd mentality, greed, and fear of missing out. This can lead bull markets to rise higher than fundamentals might predict. Fear of losses and panic can likewise lead selloffs to become crashes.
What Is Monetarism?  

Monetarism is a macroeconomic theory which states that governments can foster economic stability by targeting the growth rate of the money supply. Essentially, it is a set of views based on the belief that the total amount of money in an economy is the primary determinant of economic growth.





Key Takeaways

Monetarism is a macroeconomic theory stating that governments can foster economic stability by targeting the growth rate of the money supply.Central to monetarism is the quantity theory of money, which states that the money supply (M) multiplied by the rate at which money is spent per year (V) equals the nominal expenditures (P * Q) in the economy.Monetarism is closely associated with economist Milton Friedman, who argued that the government should keep the money supply fairly steady, expanding it slightly each year mainly to allow for the natural growth of the economy.Monetarism is a branch of Keynesian economics that emphasizes the use of monetary policy over fiscal policy to manage aggregate demand, contrary to most Keynesians.Although most modern economists reject the emphasis on money growth that monetarists purported in the past, some core tenets of the theory have become a mainstay in nonmonetarist analysis.


   Understanding Monetarism  

Monetarism is an economic school of thought which states that the supply of money in an economy is the primary driver of economic growth. As the availability of money in the system increases, aggregate demand for goods and services goes up. An increase in aggregate demand encourages job creation, which reduces the rate of unemployment and stimulates economic growth.



Monetary policy, an economic tool used in monetarism, is implemented to adjust interest rates that, in turn, control the money supply. When interest rates are increased, people have more of an incentive to save than to spend, thereby reducing or contracting the money supply. Contrarily, when interest rates are lowered following an expansionary monetary scheme, the cost of borrowing decreases, which means people can borrow more and spend more, thereby stimulating the economy.


   Milton Friedman and Monetarism  

Monetarism is closely associated with economist Milton Friedman, who argued, based on the quantity theory of money, that the government should keep the money supply fairly steady, expanding it slightly each year to allow for the natural growth of the economy. Due to the inflationary effects that can be brought about by the excessive expansion of the money supply, Friedman, who formulated the theory of monetarism, asserted that monetary policy should be done by targeting the growth rate of the money supply to maintain economic and price stability.



In his book, A Monetary History of the United States 1867–1960, Friedman proposed a fixed growth rate called the K-percent rule, suggesting that money supply should grow at a constant annual rate tied to the growth of nominal gross domestic product (GDP) and be expressed as a fixed percentage per year. This way, the money supply will be expected to grow moderately, businesses will be able to anticipate the changes to the money supply every year and plan accordingly, the economy will grow at a steady rate, and inflation will be kept at low levels.


   The Quantity Theory of Money  

Central to monetarism is the "quantity theory of money," which monetarists adopted from earlier economic theories and integrated into the general Keynesian framework of macroeconomics. The quantity theory of money can be summarized in the equation of exchange, formulated by John Stuart Mill, which states that the money supply, multiplied by the rate at which money is spent per year, equals the nominal expenditures in the economy. The formula is given as:



﻿















M


V


=


P


Q
















where:
















M


=


money supply
















V


=


velocity (rate at which money changes hands)
















P


=


average price of a good or service
















Q


=


quantity of goods and services sold








\begin{aligned} &MV = PQ \\ &\textbf{where:} \\ &M = \text{money supply} \\ &V = \text{velocity (rate at which money changes hands)} \\ &P = \text{average price of a good or service} \\ &Q = \text{quantity of goods and services sold} \\ \end{aligned}


​MV=PQwhere:M=money supplyV=velocity (rate at which money changes hands)P=average price of a good or serviceQ=quantity of goods and services sold​﻿



A key point to note is that monetarists believe that changes to M (money supply) are the driver of the equation. In short, a change in M directly affects and determines employment, inflation (P), and production (Q). In the original version of the quantity theory of money, V is held to be constant, but this assumption was dropped by John Maynard Keynes and is not assumed by the monetarists, who instead believe that V is easily predictable.



Economic growth is a function of economic activity (Q) and inflation (P). If V is constant (or at least predictable), then an increase (or decrease) in M will lead to an increase (or decrease) in either P or Q.



An increase in P denotes that Q will remain constant, while an increase in Q means that P will be relatively constant. According to monetarism, variations in the money supply will affect price levels over the long term and economic output in the short term. A change in the money supply, therefore, will directly determine prices, production, and employment.


   Monetarism vs. Keynesian Economics  

The view that velocity is constant is a source of contention among Keynesians, who believe that velocity should not be constant since the economy is volatile and subject to periodic instability. Instead, Keynes' liquidity preference theory emphasizes how changes in money demand (and thus velocity) influence the price level and aggregate demand.



Monetarism builds on the Keynesian theory by assuming the same macroeconomic framework and integrating the equation of exchange (with V swinging cyclically, as Keynes argued), but instead focuses on the role played by money supply. Because they believe that V can be relatively easily predicted, monetarists argue that the equation of exchange could be resuscitated as an approach to stabilization policy, and they favor the use of monetary policy to do so.



Proponents of monetarism generally believe that controlling an economy through fiscal policy is a poor decision because it necessarily introduces microeconomic distortions that reduce economic efficiency. They prefer monetary policy as a tool to manage aggregate demand in a way that will be more neutral from a microeconomics standpoint and that avoids the deadweight losses and social costs that fiscal policy creates in markets.


   History of Monetarism  

Monetarism gained prominence in the 1970s, a decade characterized by high and rising inflation and slow economic growth. The policies of monetarism were responsible for bringing down inflation in the United States and the United Kingdom. After U.S. inflation peaked at 20% in 1979, the Fed switched its operating strategy to reflect monetarist theory. During this time period, economists, governments, and investors eagerly jumped at every new money supply statistic.






In general, monetary policy can be characterized as contractionary or expansionary. Contractionary monetary policy is when the Fed reduces inflation by raising the federal funds rate or decreasing the money supply. Expansionary monetary policy works by expanding the money supply faster than usual or lowering short-term interest rates.



In the years that followed, however, monetarism fell out of favor with many economists, as the link between different measures of money supply and inflation proved to be less clear than most monetarist theories had suggested. In addition, monetarism's ability to explain the U.S. economy waned in the following decades. Many central banks today have stopped setting monetary targets and instead have adopted strict inflation targets.



Although most modern economists reject the emphasis on money growth that monetarists purported in the past, some core tenets of the theory have become a mainstay in nonmonetarist analysis. One of the most important of these ideas is that inflation cannot continue indefinitely without increases in the money supply. In addition, it is the responsibility (although not the primary goal) of the central bank to control inflation.



That being said, monetarist interpretations of past economic events are still relevant today. Ben Bernanke, former Fed Chairman, cited the work of Friedman in his decision to lower interest rates and increase the U.S. money supply in order to boost the economy during the global recession that began in 2007 in the United States.﻿﻿


   Real-World Examples of Monetarism  

In Friedman's seminal work, A Monetary History of the United States, 1867–1960, which he wrote with fellow economist Anna Schwartz, the two economists argued that failed monetary policy executed by the Federal Reserve was responsible for the Great Depression in the U.S. in the 1930s. In the view of Friedman and Schwartz, the Fed failed to relieve downward pressure on the money supply, and their eventual actions to reduce the money supply were the opposite of what they should have done. According to Friedman and Schwartz, markets tend towards a stable center; markets will behave erratically if the money supply is not properly set.



In 1979, when Paul Volcker became the Chairman of the Federal Reserve, he made combatting inflation the primary goal of the central bank. In keeping with Friedman and Schwartz's recommendations, Volcker restricted the money supply in order to do this. He raised the federal funds rate to 20% in 1980. At this time, this strategy for fighting stagflation (high inflation combined with high unemployment and stagnant demand) was successful. Volcker's policies drastically reduced the money supply, consumers stopped purchasing as much, and businesses stopped raising prices. However, while this caused inflation to greatly decline, it resulted in a big recession (the 1980-82 recession).



During the same time period, Britain was also struggling with severe inflation. When Margaret Thatcher was elected prime minister in 1979, she also implemented a set of monetarist policies to combat the rising prices in the country. By 1983, inflation in Britain had been halved, from 10% to 5%.



However, the popularity of monetarism was relatively brief. In the 1980s and 1990s, the link between the money supply and nominal GDP broke down; the quantity theory of money—the backbone of monetarism—was called into question and many economists who had recommended the policies of monetarism in the 1970s abandoned the approach.
What Is a Monetarist?  

A monetarist is an economist who holds the strong belief that money supply—including physical currency, deposits, and credit—is the primary factor affecting demand in an economy. Consequently, the economy's performance—its growth or contraction—can be regulated by changes in the money supply.



The key driver behind this belief is the impact of inflation on an economy's growth or health and the idea that by controlling the money supply, one can control the inflation rate.





Key Takeaways

Monetarists are economists and policymakers who subscribe to the theory of monetarism.Monetarists believe that regulating the money supply is the most effective and direct way of regulating the economyFamous monetarists include Milton Friedman, Alan Greenspan, and Margaret Thatcher.


   Understanding Monetarists  





At its core, monetarism is an economic formula. It states that money supply multiplied by its velocity (the rate at which money changes hands in an economy) is equal to nominal expenditures in the economy (goods and services) multiplied by price. While this makes sense, monetarists say velocity is generally stable, which has been debated since the 1980s.







The most well-known monetarist is Milton Friedman, who wrote the first serious analysis using monetarist theory in his 1963 book, A Monetary History of The United States, 1867–1960. In the book, Friedman along with Anna Jacobson Schwartz argued in favor of monetarism as a way to combat the economic impacts of inflation. They argued that a lack of money supply amplified the financial crisis of the late 1920s and led to the Great Depression, and that a steady increase in the money supply in line with growth in the economy would produce growth without inflation.



The monetarist view was a minority view in both academic and applied economics until the financial troubles of the 1970s. As unemployment and inflation soared, the dominant economic theory Keynesian economics was unable to explain the current economic puzzle presented by economic contraction and simultaneous inflation.



Keynesian economics said that high unemployment and economic contraction would lead to deflation through a collapse in demand and conversely that inflation was the result of demand outstripping supply in an over-heated economy. The final collapse of the gold standard in 1971, the oil shocks of the mid-1970s, and the beginning of de-industrialization in the United States in the late 1970s all contributed to stagflation, a new phenomenon that was difficult for Keynesian economics to explain.



Monetarism, however, argued that restricting the money supply would kill inflation, which would be a necessary step to regulating the economy even if it came at the cost of a short-term recession. That is exactly what Paul Volcker, the head of the Federal Reserve from 1979 to 1987, did. The result was a final vindication of monetarism in the eyes of economists and policymakers.


   Examples of Monetarists and Monetarism  

Most monetarists opposed the gold standard in that the limited supply of gold would stall the amount of money in the system, which would lead to inflation, something monetarists believe should be controlled by the money supply, which is not possible under the gold standard unless gold is continually mined.



Milton Friedman is the most famous monetarist. Other monetarists include former Federal Reserve Chair Alan Greenspan and former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.
What Is Monetarist Theory?  

The monetarist theory is an economic concept that contends that changes in money supply are the most significant determinants of the rate of economic growth and the behavior of the business cycle. When monetarist theory works in practice, central banks, which control the levers of monetary policy, can exert much power over economic growth rates.



The competing theory to the monetarist theory is Keynesian economics.





Key Takeaways

According to monetarist theory, money supply is the most important determinant of the rate of economic growth.It is governed by the MV = PQ formula, in which M = money supply, V = velocity of money, P = price of goods, and Q = quantity of goods and services.The Federal Reserve controls money in the United States and uses three main levers—the reserve ratio, discount rate, and open market operations—to increase or decrease money supply in the economy.


   Understanding Monetarist Theory  

According to monetarist theory, if a nation's supply of money increases, economic activity will increase—and vice versa.



Monetarist theory is governed by a simple formula: MV = PQ, where M is the money supply, V is the velocity (number of times per year the average dollar is spent), P is the price of goods and services and Q is the quantity of goods and services. Assuming constant V, when M is increased, either P, Q, or both P and Q rise.



General price levels tend to rise more than the production of goods and services when the economy is closer to full employment. When there is slack in the economy, Q will increase at a faster rate than P under monetarist theory.



In the U.S., the Federal Reserve (Fed) sets monetary policy without government interference. The Fed operates on a monetarist theory that focuses on maintaining stable prices (low inflation), promoting full employment, and achieving steady gross domestic product (GDP) growth.


   Controlling Money Supply  

In the U.S., it is the job of the Fed to control the money supply. The Fed has three main levers:



The reserve ratio: The percentage of reserves a bank is required to hold against deposits. A decrease in the ratio enables banks to lend more, thereby increasing the supply of money.
The discount rate: The interest rate the Fed charges commercial banks that need to borrow additional reserves. A drop in the discount rate will encourage a bank to borrow more from the Fed and therefore lend more to its customers. 
Open market operations: Open market operations consist of buying and selling government securities. Buying securities from large banks increases the supply of money, while selling securities contracts decreases the money supply in the economy.


   Example of Monetarist Theory  

Former Federal Reserve Chair Alan Greenspan was a proponent of monetarist theory. During his initial years at the Fed in 1988, he increased interest rates, decreasing growth and raising inflation rates, which almost touched five percent.



The U.S. economy tipped into recession during the early 1990s. In response, Chair Greenspan boosted economic prospects by commencing on a rate-cutting spree that resulted in the longest period of economic expansion in the history of the U.S. economy. A loose monetary policy of low interest rates made the U.S. economy prone to bubbles, culminating in the 2008 financial crisis and the Great Recession.
What Are Monetary Aggregates?  

Money aggregates are broad categories that measure the money supply in an economy. In the United States, labels are attributed to standardized monetary aggregates:



MO Physical paper and coin currency in circulation, plus bank reserves held by the central bank also known as the monetary base
M1: All of M0, plus traveler's checks and demand deposits
M2: All of M1, money market shares, and savings deposits



A legacy aggregate known as M3, which further included time deposits over $100,000 and institutional funds, has not been tracked by the Federal Reserve since 2006 but is still calculated by some analysts.





Key Takeaways

A monetary aggregate is a formal way of accounting for money, such as cash or money market funds.Monetary aggregates are used to measure the money supply in a national economy.The monetary base is an aggregate that includes the total supply of currency in circulation plus the stored portion of commercial bank reserves within the central bank.The Federal Reserve uses money aggregates as a metric for how open-market operations affect the economy. 


   Monetary Aggregates Explained  

The monetary base is a monetary aggregate that is not widely observed and differs from the money supply but is nonetheless very important. It includes the total supply of currency in circulation in addition to the stored portion of commercial bank reserves within the central bank. This is sometimes known as high-powered money (HPM) since it can be multiplied through the process of fractional reserve banking.



M1 is a narrow measure of the money supply that includes physical currency, demand deposits, traveler’s checks, and other checkable deposits. M2 is a calculation of the money supply that includes all elements of M1 as well as "near money," which refers to savings deposits, money market securities, mutual funds, and other time deposits. These assets are less liquid than M1 and not as suitable as exchange mediums, but they can be quickly converted into cash or checking deposits.





$5.25 trillion

The size of the U.S. monetary base as of September 2021



The Federal Reserve uses money aggregates as a metric for how open-market operations, such as trading in Treasury securities or changing the discount rate, affect the economy. Investors and economists observe the aggregates closely because they offer a more accurate depiction of the actual size of a country’s working money supply. By reviewing weekly reports of M1 and M2 data, investors can measure the money aggregates' rate of change and monetary velocity overall.


   The Impact of Money Aggregates  

Studying monetary aggregates can generate substantial information on the financial stability and overall health of a country. For example, monetary aggregates that grow too rapidly may cause fear of a high rate of inflation.



If there is a greater amount of money in circulation than what is needed to pay for the same amount of goods and services, prices are likely to rise. If a high rate of inflation occurs, central banking groups may be forced to raise interest rates or stop the growth in the money supply.






The amount of money the Federal Reserve releases into the economy is a preferable indication of a nation's economic health.



For decades, monetary aggregates were essential for understanding a nation's economy and were key in establishing central banking policies in general. The past few decades have revealed that there is less of a connection between fluctuations in the money supply and significant metrics such as inflation, gross domestic product (GDP), and unemployment.



The amount of money the Federal Reserve releases into the economy is a clear indicator of the central bank's monetary policy. When compared to GDP growth, M2 is still a useful indicator of potential inflation.


   Real-World Example  

According to The Economist, Sudanese citizens are demanding the resignation of President Omar al-Bashir in response to soaring food prices and an economy with inflation over 70%. These same protests are also occurring in Zimbabwe, where the central bank's bond notes, a type of monetary aggregate, are raising fears of hyperinflation after the government increased fuel prices.



In Africa, inflation has decreased over the years. In the 1980s, a fifth of countries south of the Sahara endured an average annual inflation of at least 20%. This decade only Sudan, South Sudan, and Zimbabwe have experienced high inflation rates.
What Is the Monetary Base?  

The monetary base is the total amount of a currency in circulation or held in reserves. Money in circulation is anything that is held and used by the general public while reserves refer to commercial bank deposits and any money held in reserves by these institutions at the central bank. This measure of the money supply is not often cited since it excludes other forms of non-currency money that are prevalent in a modern economy.





Key Takeaways

The monetary base of an economy includes all of the physical paper and coin currency in circulation, plus bank reserves held by the central bank.The monetary base is sometimes referred to as high-powered money as it can be expanded through the money multiplier effect of the fractional reserve banking system.The monetary base is part of the money supply in an economy.Economists typically look to more comprehensive monetary aggregates such as M1 and M2 instead of the monetary base.Many governments can manage their monetary base by buying and selling government bonds.


   Understanding the Monetary Base  

The monetary base is a component of a nation’s money supply. It refers strictly to highly liquid funds including notes, coinage, and current bank deposits. When the Federal Reserve creates new funds to purchase bonds from commercial banks, the banks see an increase in their reserve holdings, which causes the monetary base to expand.



The monetary base is a monetary aggregate that is not widely cited and differs from the money supply. But it is nonetheless very important. It includes the total supply of currency in circulation in addition to the stored portion of commercial bank reserves within the central bank. This is sometimes known as high-powered money since it can be multiplied through the process of fractional reserve banking.



The monetary base is most commonly divided into levels, listed as M0 through M3 or M4 depending on the system, with each representing a different facet of a nation’s assets:



M1: This is a narrow measure of the money supply that also includes physical currency and reserves. This measure also counts demand deposits, traveler’s checks, and other checkable deposits
M2: This is a calculation of the money supply that includes all elements of M1 as well as near money, which refers to savings deposits, money market securities, mutual funds, and other time deposits. These assets are less liquid than M1 and not as suitable as exchange mediums, but they can be quickly converted into cash or checking deposits.
M3: This is a measure of the money supply that includes M2 as well as large-time deposits, institutional money market funds, short-term repurchase agreements (repo), and larger liquid assets.



The monetary base’s funds are generally held within the lower levels of the money supply, such as M1 or M2, which encompasses cash in circulation and specific liquid assets including, but not limited to, checking and savings accounts.






The Federal Reserve stopped publishing data on M3 as of 2006.


   Monetary Base and the Money Supply  

The money supply expands beyond the monetary base to include other assets that may be less liquid in form. The funds must be considered a final settlement of a transaction in order to qualify.



For example, if a person uses cash to pay a debt, that transaction is final. Additionally, writing a check against money in a checking account or using a debit card may also be considered final since the transaction is backed by actual cash deposits once they have cleared.



In contrast, using credit to pay a debt does not qualify as part of the monetary base, as this is not the final step in the transaction. That's because using credit just transfers a debt owed from one party (the person or business receiving the credit-based payment) and the credit issuer.


  Smaller Scale Monetary Bases and Money Supplies  

The monetary base consists of all notes and coins in the possession of the household at that level, as well as any funds in deposit accounts. The money supply of a household may be extended to include any available credit open on credit cards, unused portions of lines of credit, and other accessible funds that translate into a debt that must be repaid.





$5.32 trillion

The monetary base in the United States as of July 2023. M1 stood at $18.45 trillion while M2 hit about $20.9 trillion.


   Managing Monetary Bases  

Most monetary bases are controlled by one national institution, usually a country's central bank. This body can usually change the monetary base through open market operations or monetary policies. This can be accomplished by implementing expansionary or contractionary policies.



For many countries, the government can maintain a measure of control over the monetary base by buying and selling government bonds in the open market.


   Example of a Monetary Base  

Here's a hypothetical example to show how a monetary base works. Let's suppose that Country Z has 600 million units of currency circulating in the public and its central bank has 10 billion currency units in reserve as part of deposits from many commercial banks. In this case, the monetary base for country Z is 10.6 billion currency units.




What Is the Definition of a Monetary Base?
A country's monetary base is the total amount of money that its central bank creates. This includes any money that is printed and in circulation as well as any money held in reserves at commercial banks. This base also includes money held in reserves by banks at the central bank.




What Is the Difference Between the M1 and M2 Money Supplies?
The term money supply refers to the total amount of currency and liquid assets in a country's economy. It includes any money found in circulation as well as any bank deposits that can be converted to cash. The money supply is divided into categories based on the type of currency. For instance, M1 is classified as any physical money (banknotes and coins) as well as money held in liquid vehicles like bank accounts. M2 is a broader category that includes everything in M1 as well as money market funds and short-term time deposit, such as a certificate of deposit (CD).




What Is the Total Monetary Base of the United States?
The monetary base of the United States was estimated to be $5.52 trillion as of July 2023, according to the Federal Reserve.




What Is the Monetary Base Formula?
The formula to calculate a country's monetary base is by adding together the currency in circulation and its reserves or MB = CC + R. So if there's a $1 billion worth of currency in circulation and $2 billion in reserves, the monetary base is $3 billion.




What's the Difference Between Monetary Base and Money Supply?
A country's monetary base includes any currency in circulation as well as money held in reserves at banks and with the central bank. The money supply of a country, on the other hand, refers to the total amount of money in circulation. This includes banknotes, coins, and money held by consumers at bank accounts.


   The Bottom Line  

Central banks have a variety of functions for their economies. One of the primary functions is to provide money and bank reserves. The money that they provide and inject into their economies is called the monetary base. The monetary base is important in any economy because it is used to complete and settle transactions and pay off debt.
What Is Monetary Policy?  

Monetary policy is a set of tools used by a nation's central bank to control the overall money supply and promote economic growth and employ strategies such as revising interest rates and changing bank reserve requirements.



In the United States, the Federal Reserve Bank implements monetary policy through a dual mandate to achieve maximum employment while keeping inflation in check.





Key Takeaways

Monetary policy is a set of actions to control a nation's overall money supply and achieve economic growth.Monetary policy strategies include revising interest rates and changing bank reserve requirements.Monetary policy is commonly classified as either expansionary or contractionary.The Federal Reserve commonly uses three strategies for monetary policy including reserve requirements, the discount rate, and open market operations.

   Understanding Monetary Policy  

Monetary policy is the control of the quantity of money available in an economy and the channels by which new money is supplied.



Economic statistics such as gross domestic product (GDP), the rate of inflation, and industry and sector-specific growth rates influence monetary policy strategy.



A central bank may revise the interest rates it charges to loan money to the nation's banks. As rates rise or fall, financial institutions adjust rates for their customers such as businesses or home buyers.



Additionally, it may buy or sell government bonds, target foreign exchange rates, and revise the amount of cash that the banks are required to maintain as reserves.


   Types of Monetary Policy  

Monetary policies are seen as either expansionary or contractionary depending on the level of growth or stagnation within the economy.


  Contractionary  

A contractionary policy increases interest rates and limits the outstanding money supply to slow growth and decrease inflation, where the prices of goods and services in an economy rise and reduce the purchasing power of money.


  Expansionary  

During times of slowdown or a recession, an expansionary policy grows economic activity. By lowering interest rates, saving becomes less attractive, and consumer spending and borrowing increase.


   Goals of Monetary Policy  
  Inflation  

Contractionary monetary policy is used to temper inflation and reduce the level of money circulating in the economy. Expansionary monetary policy fosters inflationary pressure and increases the amount of money in circulation.


  Unemployment  

An expansionary monetary policy decreases unemployment as a higher money supply and attractive interest rates stimulate business activities and expansion of the job market.


  Exchange Rates  

The exchange rates between domestic and foreign currencies can be affected by monetary policy. With an increase in the money supply, the domestic currency becomes cheaper than its foreign exchange.


   Tools of Monetary Policy  
  Open Market Operations  

In open market operations (OMO), the Federal Reserve Bank buys bonds from investors or sells additional bonds to investors to change the number of outstanding government securities and money available to the economy as a whole.



The objective of OMOs is to adjust the level of reserve balances to manipulate the short-term interest rates and that affect other interest rates.


  Interest Rates  

The central bank may change the interest rates or the required collateral that it demands. In the U.S., this rate is known as the discount rate. Banks will loan more or less freely depending on this interest rate.






The Federal Reserve commonly uses three strategies for monetary policy including reserve requirements, the discount rate, and open market operations.


  Reserve Requirements  

Authorities can manipulate the reserve requirements, the funds that banks must retain as a proportion of the deposits made by their customers to ensure that they can meet their liabilities.



Lowering this reserve requirement releases more capital for the banks to offer loans or buy other assets. Increasing the requirement curtails bank lending and slows growth.


   Monetary Policy vs. Fiscal Policy  

Monetary policy is enacted by a central bank to sustain a level economy and keep unemployment low, protect the value of the currency, and maintain economic growth. By manipulating interest rates or reserve requirements, or through open market operations, a central bank affects borrowing, spending, and savings rates.



Fiscal policy is an additional tool used by governments and not central banks. While the Federal Reserve can influence the supply of money in the economy and impact market sentiment, The U.S. Treasury Department can create new money and implement new tax policies. It sends money, directly or indirectly, into the economy to increase spending and spur growth.



Both monetary and fiscal tools were coordinated efforts in a series of government and Federal Reserve programs launched in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.




How Often Does Monetary Policy Change?
The Federal Open Market Committee of the Federal Reserve meets eight times a year to determine changes to the nation's monetary policies. The Federal Reserve may also act in an emergency as was evident during the 2007-2008 economic crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic.




How Has Monetary Policy Been Used to Curb Inflation In the United States?
A contractionary policy can slow economic growth and even increase unemployment but is often seen as necessary to level the economy and keep prices in check. During double-digit inflation in the 1980s, the Federal Reserve raised its benchmark interest rate to 20%. Though the effect of high rates spurred a recession, inflation was reduced to a range of 3% to 4% over the following years.




Why Is the Federal Reserve Called a Lender of Last Resort?
The Fed also serves the role of lender of last resort, providing banks with liquidity and regulatory scrutiny to prevent them from failing and creating financial panic in the economy.


   The Bottom Line  

Monetary policy employs tools used by central bankers to keep a nation's economy stable while limiting inflation and unemployment. Expansionary monetary policy stimulates a receding economy and contractionary monetary policy slows down an inflationary economy. A nation's monetary policy is often coordinated with its fiscal policy.
What Is It to Monetize?  

"Monetize" refers to the process of turning a non-revenue-generating item into cash. In many cases, monetization looks to novel methods of creating income from new sources, such as embedding ad revenues inside of social media video clips to pay content creators. Sometimes, monetization is due to privatization (called commodification), whereby a previously free or public asset is turned into a profit center—such as a public road being converted into a private tollway.



The term "monetize" may also refer to liquidating an asset or object for cash.





Key Takeaways

Monetize converts otherwise non-revenue-generating items or activities into cash flows.Monetization often arises through identifying new or novel income sources.Website owners monetize their websites by making spaces available to advertisers, thereby earning income from various types of content published on their sites.Social media platforms have extended monetization by selling individual user data to the highest bidder.The U.S. Federal Reserve monetizes the nation's debt by buying notes, bills, and bonds—collectively known as Treasuries—issued by the U.S. Treasury, which keeps interest rates low.


   Understanding Monetization  

The term "monetize" can take on different meanings depending on the context. Governments monetize debt to keep interest rates on borrowed money low. Though, if the need should arise, they may also do so to avoid a financial crisis while businesses monetize products and services to generate profit.



Monetization seems to go hand-in-hand with contemporary capitalism. The process of monetizing is very important to a business or other entity's growth as it is key to its strategic planning. Indeed, finding novel ways to turn otherwise neutral or costly business operations into profit centers is a goal of today's entrepreneurs and is sought after by investors.






Monetization is not new. Free TV and radio broadcasts have been funded by advertising for decades. And for decades before that, newspapers have relied on print advertising in addition to paid subscriptions.


   Commercial Monetization Online  

Web publishing and e-commerce activities have made monetization a well-known concept among average Americans. Website owners monetize their websites by making spaces available to advertisers, thereby earning income from various types of content published on their sites. More sophisticated forms of web monetization involve creating sales funnels from subscriber lists and producing e-books from previously published content.



When people browse websites and click on advertiser links, website owners—either individuals or large media companies—earn money. Website owners may be paid for the number of times site visitors see advertisements without engaging with them, depending on the arrangements with advertisers. If a website attracts enough visitors, the money paid by advertisers can add up to substantial earnings.



If a particular website has proven traffic stats, companies may pay more to place advertisements on the site's home page or certain pages that attract large numbers of visitors. Selling software applications (apps), subscriptions, and multimedia content such as videos and podcasts are additional ways businesses monetize content.


  Example of Commercial Monetization Online  

The online music streaming service Spotify, for example, was able to monetize its streaming service by embedding both visual and audio advertising into its platform for "free" users. Those users who wish to do away with these ads can pay a regular subscription fee instead. Either way, the company has monetized its service among its customer base.


   Social Media Monetization  

An extension of web-based strategies to turn page views and clicks into revenues, social media has taken the idea of monetization a step further. In addition to embedding ads, social media platforms like Meta and Instagram collect user information and data to create targeted advertising and marketing campaigns. Here, user data itself becomes monetized and sold to the highest bidder.





Facebook's Name Change

On Oct.r 28, 2021, Facebook changed its name to Meta. The company changed its stock ticker from FB to META on Dec. 1, 2021.


  Meta  

For social media giant Meta, the importance of monetizing user data is paramount. Meta collects all sorts of data from its users, from demographic information to click behavior and social network connections. There's a reason why Meta's 10-K filing with the SEC uses the acronym ARPU, as in average revenue per user. According to Meta's year-end 2021 results, its worldwide ARPU was $11.57, while the combined ARPU for the U.S. and Canada was $60.57. When you multiply those numbers by the monthly average user base of 2.91 billion, it's easy to understand why Meta has a market capitalization of over $600 billion.






Since Meta owns Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, it is able to aggregate even more data on its users and provide more screen space for advertisers.


  YouTube  

Similar to Meta, YouTube—and all other Google-owned properties, collect user data along with a variety of dimensions. The company pulls in more user data the longer users stay in the Googleverse, which includes YouTube but also sites like G-Mail, Google Search, Google Maps, and Android OS. All that data helps it market more efficiently across all its platforms. When watching YouTube videos, Google is able to target advertising and sell your data via its Adsense and Adwords platforms where companies bid for the opportunity to display their ad to you.


  TikTok  

In addition to placing ads like YouTube, TikTok videos are monetized through strategic brand takeovers and branded hashtag challenges. More than overt product placement, these ads appear immediately and are targeted to specific users, and engage users to participate through challenges—which incentivizes the creation of even more monetized content.


  X Platform (Formerly Twitter)  

X divides its revenue into two categories: the sale of advertising services, which constitutes the vast majority of the company's revenue, as well as data licensing and other services. Aside from targeted ads that appear as tweets, It also sells subscriptions for access to its data via an API to companies and developers looking to "access, search and analyze historical and real-time data" on the platform. The "other sources" include service fees the platform collects from users of its mobile ad exchange, MoPub.


   Government Debt Monetization  

The U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed) monetizes the nation's debt by buying government-issued notes, bills, and bonds—collectively known as Treasuries, which as the name implies are issued by the U.S. Treasury. The Fed purchases these debt instruments using newly-created credit money, which the government uses for its operations without actually having to print any excess physical currency. This type of monetization effectively puts the government's debt onto the Fed's balance sheet and puts liquidity into the financial system.


  Example of Government Debt Monetization  

As an example, let's say that the government needs $5 million for a social program. It raises $4 million through taxation but still needs an additional one million. The government can either borrow the money, print the money, increase taxes, or reduce spending and budget that towards the program.



The government decides to borrow the money from the public by issuing $1 million in low-risk Treasury bonds. That $1 million in Treasuries can then be purchased by the central bank (i.e., the Fed), which creates $1 million in new bank reserves that banks can use to lend to borrowers.




What Does Monetization Mean?
Monetization literally means to convert something into money. In practice, this means turning things into revenue-generating activities, services, or assets.




How Do You Monetize Something?
Monetization strategies are not always easy to figure out. It took social media sites almost a decade to figure out how to turn user data into dollar signs. Online advertising revenues make up a large chunk of monetization efforts today, but the commodification of user data may take on new and different purposes that have value to somebody willing to pay for it.




How Do I Monetize My YouTube Videos?
To start earning money on YouTube, you need to reach a large enough audience to make the ads shown on your videos add up. According to YouTube, you'll also need a minimum of 4,000 watch hours in the last 12 months and 1,000+ subscribers to access the YouTube Partner Program (YPP). Some popular YouTubers may be able to earn extra money through product placement or other forms of corporate sponsorship in their videos. YouTube also has a feature to include mid-roll ads in videos 8 minutes or longer, generating more earnings for creators.




How Do I Monetize Instagram?
You can leverage your engaged fan-following to promote brands in return for a payment from product placement on Instagram posts. It's also possible to generate sales for your own products and services with your posts.




Why Does the Fed Monetize Government Debt?
A central bank monetizes its government debt when it converts Treasuries into credit or cash. This is done to manage the money supply, and in some cases to create extra liquidity in order to stimulate a sagging economy.


   The Bottom Line  

Monetization involves taking a non-revenue-generating item or service and finding ways to access its income potential. Examples include ads embedded in social media video clips, services that were previously free now being available at a price, or different tiers of the same service being offered at different price points—such as a "premium" level that is more costly. Monetization can also be a function of the government, as in the example of the U.S. Federal Reserve, which monetizes U.S. debt through the buying of Treasuries.
What Is Money?  

Money is a system of value that facilitates the exchange of goods in an economy. Using money allows buyers and sellers to pay less in transaction costs, compared to barter trading.



The first types of money were commodities. Their physical properties made them desirable as a medium of exchange. In contemporary markets, money can include government-issued legal tender or fiat money, money substitutes, fiduciary media, or electronic cryptocurrencies.





Key Takeaways

Money is a system of value that facilitates the exchange of goods.The use of money eliminates the problem of bartering where both parties must have something the other wants or needs.Historically, the first forms of money were agricultural commodities, such as grain or livestock.Today, most money systems are based on standardized currencies that are controlled by central banks.Digital cryptocurrencies also have some of the specific properties of money.


   How Money Works  

Money is a liquid asset used to facilitate transactions of value. It is used as a medium of exchange between individuals and entities. It's also a store of value and a unit of account that can measure the value of other goods.



Prior to the invention of money, most economies relied on bartering, where individuals would trade the goods they had directly for those that they needed. This raised the problem of the double coincidence of wants: a transaction could only take place if both participants had something that the other needed. Money eliminates this problem by acting as an intermediary good.



The first known forms of money were agricultural commodities, such as grain or cattle. These goods were in high demand and traders knew that they would be able to use or trade these goods again in the future. Cocoa beans, cowrie shells, and agricultural tools have also served as early forms of money.



As economies became more complex, money was standardized into currencies. This reduced transaction costs by making it easier to measure and compare value. Also, the representations of money became increasingly abstract, from precious metals and stamped coins to paper notes, and, in the modern era, electronic records.






During World War II, cigarettes became a de facto currency for soldiers in prisoner-of-war camps. The use of cigarettes as money made tobacco highly desirable, even among soldiers who did not smoke.


   What Are the Properties of Money?  

In order to be most useful, money should be fungible, durable, portable, recognizable, and stable. These properties reduce the transaction cost of using money by making it easy to exchange.


  Money Should Be Fungible  

The word fungible refers to a quality that allows one thing to be exchanged, substituted, or returned for another thing, under the assumption of equivalent value. Thus, units of money should be interchangeable with one another.



For example, metal coins should have a standard weight and purity. Commodity money should be relatively uniform in quality. Trying to use a non-fungible good as money results in transaction costs that involve individually evaluating each unit of the good before an exchange can take place.


  Money Should Be Durable  

Money should be durable enough to retain its usefulness for many, future exchanges. A perishable good or a good that degrades quickly due to various exchanges will be less useful for future transactions. Trying to use a non-durable good as money conflicts with money's essential future-oriented use and value. 


  Money Should Be Portable  

Money should be easy to carry and divide so that a worthwhile quantity can be carried on one's person or transported. For example, trying to use a good that's difficult or inconvenient to carry as money could require physical transportation that results in transaction costs.


  Money Should Be Recognizable  

The authenticity and quantity of the good should be readily apparent to users so that they can easily agree to the terms of an exchange. Using a non-recognizable good as money can result in transaction costs relating to authenticating the goods and agreeing on the quantity needed for an exchange. 


  Money's Supply Should Be Stable  

The supply of the item used as money should be relatively constant over time to prevent fluctuations in value. Using a non-stable good as money produces transaction costs due to the risk that its value might rise or fall, because of scarcity or over-abundance, before the next transaction.


   How Is Money Used?  

Money primarily functions as the good people use for exchanges of items of value. However, it also has secondary functions that derive from its use as a medium of exchange.


  Money as a Unit of Account  

Due to money's use as a medium of exchange for buying and selling and as a value indicator for all kinds of goods and services, money can be used as a unit of account.



That means money can keep track of changes in the value of items over time and multiple transactions. People can use it to compare the values of various combinations or quantities of different goods and services.



Money as a unit of account makes it possible to account for profits and losses, balance a budget, and value the total assets of a company.


  Money as a Store of Value  

Money's usefulness as a medium of exchange in transactions is inherently future-oriented. As such, it provides a means to store a monetary value for use in the future without having that value deteriorate.



So, when people exchange items for money, that money retains a particular value that can be used in other transactions. This ability to function as a store of value facilitates saving for the future and engaging in transactions over long distances. 


  Money as a Standard of Deferred Payment  

To the extent that money is accepted as a medium of exchange and serves as a useful store of value, it can be used to transfer value over different time periods in the form of credits and debts.



One person can borrow a quantity of money from someone else for an agreed-upon period of time, and repay a different agreed-upon quantity of money at a future date.


   What Are the Different Types of Money  
  Market-Determined Money  

Money can originate out of the spontaneous order of markets. As traders barter for various goods, some goods will prove more convenient than others because they have the best combination of the five properties of money listed above.



Over time, these goods may become desirable as objects of exchange, rather than for practical use. Eventually, people may come to desire a good solely for future trading.



Historically, precious metals such as gold and silver were often used as market-determined monies. They were highly prized across many different cultures and societies. Today, people in cashless economies frequently turn to cigarettes, instant noodles, or other nonperishable goods as a market-determined money substitute.


  Government-Issued Currency  

When a certain type of money is widely accepted throughout an economy, government bodies may begin regulating it as a currency. They may issue standardized coins or notes to further reduce transaction costs.



A government may also recognize some money as a legal tender, meaning that courts and government bodies must accept that form of money as a final means of payment.



Issuing money allows the government to benefit from seigniorage, the difference between the face value of a currency and the cost to produce it.



For example, if the cost of printing a $100 bill is only $10, the government will earn a $90 profit for each bill it prints. However, governments that rely too heavily on seigniorage may inadvertently debase their currency.

  Fiat Currency  

Many countries issue fiat currency, which is currency that does not represent any type of commodity. Instead, fiat money is backed by the economic strength of the issuing government. It derives its value from supply and demand and the stability of the government.



Fiat money allows the issuing government to conduct economic policy by increasing or reducing the money supply. In the U.S., the Federal Reserve and the Treasury Department monitor several types of money supplies for the purpose of regulating and mitigating monetary issues.



Since fiat money does not represent a real commodity, it falls to the issuing government to ensure that it meets the five properties of money outlined above.



The International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank serve as global watchdogs for the exchange of international currencies. Governments may enact capital controls or establish pegs in order to stabilize their currency on the international market.


  Money Substitutes and Fiduciary Media  

To reduce the burden of carrying large quantities of currency, merchants and traders sometimes exchange money substitutes such as written statements of debt that can be redeemed later. These statements can themselves adopt some of the properties of money, particularly if traders use them in lieu of actual currency.



For example, ancient banks issued bills of exchange to their depositors, stating the amount that had been deposited and the terms for redemption. Rather than withdraw money from the bank to make payments, depositors would simply trade their bills, allowing the recipient to redeem or trade them at will.



This use of money substitutes can increase the portability and durability of money, as well as reduce the cost of storage. However, there are risks involved with money substitutes. Banks may print more bills than they have money to redeem, a practice known as fractional reserve banking. If too many people try to make withdrawals at the same time, the bank may suffer from a bank run.



Fiduciary media are types of money substitutes introduced into circulation that aren't fully backed by the base money held to back money substitutes. For example, paper checks, token coins, and electronic credit represent contemporary examples of fiduciary media.


  Cryptocurrencies As Money  

In recent years, digital currencies that do not exist in physical form, such as Bitcoin, have been introduced. Unlike electronic bank records or payment systems, these virtual currencies are not issued by a government or other central body. Cryptocurrencies have some of the properties of money and are sometimes used in online transactions.



Although cryptocurrencies are rarely used in everyday transactions, they have achieved some utility as a speculative investment or a store of value. Some jurisdictions have recognized cryptocurrencies as a payment medium, including the government of El Salvador.




What Are the 4 Types of Money?
Money can be something determined by market participants to have value and be exchangeable. Money can be currency (bills and coins) issued by a government. A third type of money is fiat currency, which is fully backed by the economic power and good faith of the issuing government. The fourth type of money is money substitutes, which are anything that can be exchanged for money at any time. For example, a check written on a checking account at a bank is a money substitute.




What Is the Difference Between Hard and Soft Money?
Hard money is money that is based on a valuable commodity, such as gold or silver. Since the supply of these metals is limited, these currencies are less susceptible to inflation than soft money such as printed banknotes. With no guarantee that extra notes will not be printed, soft money may be considered risky by some.




Is Cryptocurrency Money?
Cryptocurrency has many of the properties of money and is sometimes used as a medium of exchange for transactions. Many governments consider cryptocurrency to be a taxable asset, but very few give it the same legal treatment as a foreign currency. Some jurisdictions, notably El Salvador, have embraced cryptocurrency.


   The Bottom Line  

Money is some item of value that allows people and institutions to engage in transactions that result in an exchange of goods or services.



Money has to be exchangeable, convenient to carry, recognized as legitimate by all, physically long-lasting, and have a value that's stable.



Money comes in various forms, including precious metals, currencies, and money substitutes. At this time, though cryptocurrencies have some of the properties of money, they function without a central authority and aren't backed by governments. While cryptocurrencies (such as Bitcoin) are considered property for tax purposes by the IRS, they aren't considered legal tender by the U.S. government.
What Are Money Center Banks?  

A money center bank is similar in structure to a standard bank; however, it's borrowing, and lending activities are with governments, large corporations, and regular banks. These types of financial institutions (or designated branches of these institutions) generally do not borrow from or lend to consumers.





Key Takeaways

A money center bank is similar in structure to a standard bank; however, it's borrowing, and lending activities are with governments, large corporations, and regular banks.Four examples of large money center banks in the United States include Bank of America, Citi, JP Morgan, and Wells Fargo, among others.Most money center banks raise funds from domestic and international money marks (as opposed to relying on depositors, like traditional banks).


   Understanding Money Center Banks  

Money center banks are usually located in major economic centers such as London, Hong Kong, Tokyo, and New York. With their large balance sheets, these banks are involved in national, and international financial systems.


   Money Center Banks and the 2008 Financial Crisis  

Four examples of large money center banks in the United States include Bank of America, Citi, JP Morgan, and Wells Fargo, among others. During the 2008 financial crisis, these banks struggled financially; however, the U.S. Federal Reserve stepped in with three phases of quantitative easing (QE) and bought back mortgages.



In 2004, U.S. homeownership peaked at 70%; during the last quarter of 2005, home prices started to fall, which led to a 40% decline in the U.S. Home Construction Index during 2006. At this point, subprime borrowers were not able to withstand the higher interest rates and began defaulting on their loans. In 2007, multiple subprime lenders were filing for bankruptcy. This had a ripple effect throughout the entire U.S. financial services industry—of course, hitting many money center banks hard.



During the period of QE, these financial institutions had a steady stream of cash, with which they were able to originate new mortgages and loans, supporting overall economic recovery.



Once the QE programs ceased, many were concerned that money center banks would not be able to grow organically without support. This is because the banks' primary sources of income were loan and mortgage interest charges. However, U.S. interest rates did begin to rise, and with them, money center banks’ net interest income also rose.


   Money Center Banks and Dividend Income  

Most money center banks raise funds from domestic and international money marks (as opposed to relying on depositors, like traditional banks). The dividend yields of these institutions are enviable for some, who like to collect such securities for income.



The formula for calculating dividend yield is as follows:



﻿






=


 




Annual Dividends Per Share




Price Per Share







\displaystyle{=\ \frac{\text{Annual Dividends Per Share}}{\text{Price Per Share}}}


= Price Per ShareAnnual Dividends Per Share​﻿



Estimated current year yields often use the previous year’s dividend yield or take the latest quarterly yield, and then multiply this by four (adjusting for seasonality) and divide it by the current share price.



Quarterly rates of return are often annualized for comparative purposes. A stock or bond might return 5% in Q1. We could annualize the return by multiplying 5% by the number of periods or quarters in a year. The investment would have an annualized return of 20% because there are four quarters in one year or (5% * 4 = 20%).
What Is Money Factor?  

Money factor is a method for determining the financing charges on a lease with monthly payments. A money factor can be translated into the more common annual percentage rate (APR) by multiplying the money factor by 2,400.



Money factor is also known as a "lease factor," "lease fee," or "lease money factor."





Key Takeaways

The money factor is the financing charge a person will pay on a lease.It is similar to the interest rate paid on a loan, and it is also based on a customer's credit score.It is commonly depicted as a very small decimal that begins in the thousandth place (i.e., 0.00#).Multiplying the money factor by 2,400 will give the equivalent annual percentage rate (APR).A lower money factor is more favorable to a borrower, and the money factor can be negotiated.


   How the Money Factor Is Used  

An individual who takes out a lease on a car pays for the amount by which the value of the vehicle depreciates during the time he is in possession of it. The monthly lease payments made on the car include depreciation, taxes, and interest. If the car is expected to depreciate in value by $5,000 annually, this amount will be factored into the monthly payments. Sales taxes are charged on both depreciation and interest and are included in the monthly payments of the lessee.



To determine the interest portion of monthly lease payments, the money factor is used. In effect, the money factor is the interest rate that is paid for the duration of a lease term. It is similar to the interest rate paid on a loan, but the value of the money factor is expressed differently.



Unlike APR, which is expressed as a percentage, the money factor is expressed in a decimal format. Either way, the interest rate and money factor can be obtained by contacting the car dealer or checking with the credit union.





Important

The money factor is directly determined by a customer's credit score. The higher the credit score, the lower the money factor on a lease, and vice versa.


   Calculating the Money Factor  

The money factor can be calculated in two ways. One method relies on knowing the APR of the lease, while the other method requires leasing information such as payments, residual value, and the duration of the lease.


  APR Method  

First, the money factor can be converted to the equivalent APR by multiplying by 2,400. In the same vein, if the car dealer uses an interest rate, this can be converted to a money factor by dividing by 2,400.



For example, if quoted a money factor of .002, the interest rate on that loan would be approximately (0.002) x 2,400 = 4.8%. Likewise, if the car dealer quotes a lease APR of 4.8%, a lessee can figure out the money factor of .002 by dividing the APR by 2,400.


  Leasing Information Method  

The second method of calculating the money factor is using the lease charge. If instead of an interest rate, the car dealer quotes a lease charge, the money factor can be calculated as:



Money Factor = Lease Charge / (Capitalized Cost + Residual Value) * Lease Term




The lease charge of this formula is the sum of all future monthly finance costs over the entire life of the lease. The capitalized cost is the agreed-upon cost you agree to pay for the vehicle, while the residual value is the agreed-upon value of the vehicle at the end of the lease. The lease term is expressed as the total number of months of the lease.


   Special Considerations  

A money factor may also be presented as a factor of 1,000, such as 2.0 rather than .002. While the decimal version is more common, a money factor that is a whole number can still be converted to an APR by multiplying it by 2.4. For example, a money factor of 2.0 translates to an APR of 4.8% when the money factor is multiplied by 2.4.






It is important to remember the 2.0 figure depicted above is not the APR on the lease. The money factor will always be lower than the APR, even when displayed as an integer greater than 1.



In addition to being determined by the borrower's credit history, the money factor is also affected by the financing company's rates as well as the dealer's markup. The money factor for a lease has historically been comparable to the national average for new car loans.




What Is a Good Money Factor?
The money factor is the interest assessment on a lease. For this reason, a lower money factor is more favorable to a borrower as it signifies a lower financing charge. A good money factor will largely depend on borrower credit and prevailing market conditions, but a fairly good money factor of 25 (0.0025) and below translates to an imposed 6% APR.




How Is Money Factor Calculated?
There are several ways to calculate the money factor. First, the money factor can be multiplied by 2,400 to arrive at an APR. Alternatively, the formula below can be used as a substitute:Money Factor = Lease Charge / (Capitalized Cost * Residual Value) * Lease Term




Can You Negotiate Money Factor?
The negotiability of the money depends on the dealer. Some dealers may explicitly state the money factor is not negotiable, while others are open to negotiating the money factor to align to current market interest rates.




What Is a High Money Factor?
Each borrower will have their own opinion regarding what constitutes a high money factor. In general, a money factor of at least 35 (0.0035) translates to at least an 8.4% APR. For many, a money factor of at least 35 would be considered high.




Is Money Factor Based on Credit?
A borrower's money factor is largely based on the borrower's credit score. Borrowers with higher credit scores will often have a lower money factor on a lease, while lower credit borrowers will have higher money factors.
What is Money Flow  

Money flow is calculated by averaging the high, low and closing prices, and multiplying by the daily volume. Comparing that result with the number for the previous day tells traders whether money flow was positive or negative for the current day. Positive money flow indicates that prices are likely to move higher, while negative money flow suggests prices are about to fall. The below example shows negative money flow between Day One and Day Two:

   BREAKING DOWN Money Flow  

Positive money flow occurs when a stock is purchased at a higher price (an uptick). Negative money flow occurs when the next trade is purchased at a lower price (a downtick).



If more shares were bought throughout the day on the uptick than the downtick, net money flow is positive because more investors were willing to pay a premium for the stock. If money flow is negative when a stock's price is rising, this could indicate a pending price reversal. Investors monitor money flow because trading volume is typically considered to lead price, which could help identify early trading opportunities.


   Money Flow and Money Flow Indicators  

Many traders use the Chaikin money flow oscillator when they want to incorporate money flow into their trading decisions. The indicator, created by Marc Chaikin, produces values for buying and selling pressure like other money flow indicators but also uses two exponential moving averages to determine momentum in a similar way that the moving average convergence divergence (MACD) indicator does.



Traders also frequently use the money flow index (MFI) when they want to analyze price and volume. This indicator divides the net positive money flow by the net negative money flow and plots the value as a line that traders can compare to the price of a security to identify overbought and oversold levels. If the indicator is above 80, prices are considered overbought. A value below 20 indicates oversold conditions.



Other technical indicators should be used in conjunction with money flow indicators to improve their effectiveness and reduce false trading signals.
What Is the Money Flow Index (MFI)?  

The Money Flow Index (MFI) is a technical oscillator that uses price and volume data for identifying overbought or oversold signals in an asset. It can also be used to spot divergences which warn of a trend change in price. The oscillator moves between 0 and 100.



Unlike conventional oscillators such as the Relative Strength Index (RSI), the Money Flow Index incorporates both price and volume data, as opposed to just price. For this reason, some analysts call MFI the volume-weighted RSI.





Key Takeaways

The Money Flow Index (MFI) is a technical indicator that generates overbought or oversold signals using both prices and volume data.An MFI reading above 80 is considered overbought and an MFI reading below 20 is considered oversold, although levels of 90 and 10 are also used as thresholds.A divergence between the indicator and price is noteworthy. For example, if the indicator is rising while the price is falling or flat, the price could start rising.

When the price advances from one period to the next Raw Money Flow is positive and it is added to Positive Money Flow. When Raw Money Flow is negative because the price dropped that period, it is added to Negative Money Flow.






   How to Calculate the Money Flow Index  

There are several steps for calculating the Money Flow Index. If doing it by hand, using a spreadsheet is recommended.



Calculate the typical price for each of the last 14 periods.For each period, mark whether the typical price was higher or lower than the prior period. This will tell you whether raw money flow is positive or negative.Calculate raw money flow by multiplying the typical price by volume for that period. Use negative or positive numbers depending on whether the period was up or down (see step above).Calculate the money flow ratio by adding up all the positive money flows over the last 14 periods and dividing it by the negative money flows for the last 14 periods.Calculate the Money Flow Index (MFI) using the ratio found in step four.Continue doing the calculations as each new period ends, using only the last 14 periods of data.


   What Does the Money Flow Index Tell You?  

One of the primary ways to use the Money Flow Index is when there is a divergence. A divergence is when the oscillator is moving in the opposite direction of price. This is a signal of a potential reversal in the prevailing price trend.



For example, a very high Money Flow Index that begins to fall below a reading of 80 while the underlying security continues to climb is a price reversal signal to the downside. Conversely, a very low MFI reading that climbs above a reading of 20 while the underlying security continues to sell off is a price reversal signal to the upside.



Traders also watch for larger divergences using multiple waves in the price and MFI. For example, a stock peaks at $10, pulls back to $8, and then rallies to $12. The price has made two successive highs, at $10 and $12. If MFI makes a lower higher when the price reaches $12, the indicator is not confirming the new high. This could foreshadow a decline in price.



The overbought and oversold levels are also used to signal possible trading opportunities. Moves below 10 and above 90 are rare. Traders watch for the MFI to move back above 10 to signal a long trade, and to drop below 90 to signal a short trade.



Other moves out of overbought or oversold territory can also be useful. For example, when an asset is in an uptrend, a drop below 20 (or even 30) and then a rally back above it could indicate a pullback is over and the price uptrend is resuming. The same goes for a downtrend. A short-term rally could push the MFI up to 70 or 80, but when it drops back below that could be the time to enter a short trade in preparation for another drop.


   The Difference Between the Money Flow Index and the Relative Strength Index (RSI)  

The MFI and RSI are very closely related. The main difference is that MFI incorporates volume, while the RSI does not. Proponents of volume analysis believe it is a leading indicator. Therefore, they also believe that MFI will provide signals, and warn of possible reversals, in a more timely fashion than the RSI. One indicator is not better than the other, they are simply incorporating different elements and will, therefore, provide signals at different times.


   Limitations of the Money Flow Index  

The MFI is capable of producing false signals. This is when the indicator does something that indicates a good trading opportunity is present, but then the price doesn't move as expected resulting in a losing trade. A divergence may not result in a price reversal, for instance.



The indicator may also fail to warn of something important. For example, while a divergence may result in a price reversing some of the time, divergence won't be present for all price reversals. Because of this, it is recommended that traders use other forms of analysis and risk control and not rely exclusively on one indicator.
What Is Money Illusion?  

Money illusion is an economic theory positing that people have a tendency to view their wealth and income in nominal dollar terms, rather than in real terms. In other words, it is assumed that people do not take into account the level of inflation in an economy, wrongly believing that a dollar is worth the same as it was the prior year.



Money illusion is sometimes also referred to as price illusion.





Key Takeaways

Money illusion posits that people have a tendency to view their wealth and income in nominal dollar terms, rather than recognize their real value, adjusted for inflation.Economists cite factors such as a lack of financial education and the price stickiness seen in many goods and services as triggers of money illusion.Employers are sometimes said to take advantage of this, modestly lifting wages in nominal terms without actually paying more in real terms.


   Understanding Money Illusion  

Money illusion is a psychological matter that is debated among economists. Some disagree with the theory, arguing that people automatically think of their money in real terms, adjusting for inflation because they see price changes every time they enter a store.



Other economists, meanwhile, claim that money illusion is rife, citing factors such as a lack of financial education, and the price stickiness seen in many goods and services as reasons why people might fall into the trap of ignoring the rising cost of living.



Money illusion is often cited as a reason why small levels of inflation—1% to 2% per year—are actually desirable for an economy. Low inflation allows employers, for example, to modestly raise wages in nominal terms without actually paying more in real terms. As a result, many people who get pay raises believe that their wealth is increasing, regardless of the actual rate of inflation.



Notably, people's perceptions of financial outcomes are colored by money illusion. Experiments have shown, for example, that people generally perceive a 2% pay cut in nominal income with no change in monetary value as unfair. However, they also perceive a 2% rise in nominal income, when inflation is running at 4%, as fair.


   History of Money Illusion  

The term money illusion was first coined by American economist Irving Fisher in his book “Stabilizing the Dollar.” Fisher later wrote an entire book dedicated to the topic in 1928, titled “The Money Illusion.”



British economist John Maynard Keynes is credited with helping to popularize the term.


   Money Illusion vs. the Phillips Curve  

Money illusion is understood to be a key aspect in the Friedmanian version of the Phillips curve—a popular tool for analyzing macroeconomic policy. The Philips curve claims that economic growth is accompanied by inflation, which in turn should lead to more jobs and less unemployment. 



Money illusion helps to sustain that theory. It argues that employees seldom demand an increase in wages to compensate for inflation, making it easier for firms to hire staff on the cheap. Still, money illusion doesn't adequately account for the mechanism at work in the Phillips curve. To do so requires two additional assumptions.



First, prices respond differently to modified demand conditions: An increase in aggregate demand affects commodity prices sooner than it affects labor market prices. Thus, a drop in unemployment is, after all, an outcome of decreasing real wages, and an accurate judgment of the situation by employees is the only reason for the return to an initial (natural) rate of unemployment (i.e. the end of the money illusion, when they finally recognize the actual dynamics of prices and wages).



The other (arbitrary) assumption relates specifically to special informational asymmetry: Whatever employees are unaware of, in connection with the changes in (real and nominal) wages and prices, can be clearly observed by employers. The new classical version of the Phillips curve was aimed at removing the puzzling additional presumptions, but its mechanism still requires money illusion.
What Is Money Laundering?  

Money laundering is the illegal process of making large amounts of money generated by criminal activity, such as drug trafficking or terrorist funding, appear to have come from a legitimate source. The money from the criminal activity is considered dirty, and the process “launders” it to make it look clean.



Money laundering is a serious financial crime that is employed by white-collar and street-level criminals alike. Most financial companies today have anti-money-laundering (AML) policies in place to detect and prevent this activity.





Key Takeaways

Money laundering is the illegal process of making “dirty” money appear legitimate instead of ill-gotten.Criminals use a wide variety of money-laundering techniques to make illegally obtained funds appear clean.Online banking and cryptocurrencies have made it easier for criminals to transfer and withdraw money without detection.The prevention of money laundering has become an international effort and now includes terrorist funding among its targets.The financial industry also has its own set of strict anti-money laundering (AML) measures in place.

   How Money Laundering Works  

Money laundering is essential for criminal organizations that wish to use illegally obtained money effectively. Dealing with large amounts of illegal cash is inefficient and dangerous. Criminals need a way to deposit money in legitimate financial institutions, yet they can only do so if it appears to come from legitimate sources.



The process of laundering money typically involves three steps: placement, layering, and integration.



Placement surreptitiously injects the “dirty money” into the legitimate financial system.Layering conceals the source of the money through a series of transactions and bookkeeping tricks.In the final step, integration, the now-laundered money is withdrawn from the legitimate account to be used for whatever purposes the criminals have in mind for it.



Note that in real-life situations, this template may differ. Money laundering may not involve all three stages, or some stages could be combined or repeated several times.



There are many ways to launder money, from the simple to the very complex. One of the most common techniques is to use a legitimate, cash-based business owned by a criminal organization. For example, if the organization owns a restaurant, it might inflate the daily cash receipts to funnel illegal cash through the restaurant and into the restaurant’s bank account. After that, the funds can be withdrawn as needed. These types of businesses are often referred to as “fronts.”






Banks are required to report large cash transactions and other suspicious activities that might be signs of money laundering.


   Variants of Money Laundering  

One common form of money laundering is called smurfing (also known as “structuring”). This is where the criminal breaks up large chunks of cash into multiple small deposits, often spreading them over many different accounts, to avoid detection. Money laundering can also be accomplished through the use of currency exchanges, wire transfers, and “mules”—cash smugglers, who sneak large amounts of cash across borders and deposit them in foreign accounts, where money-laundering enforcement is less strict.



Other money-laundering methods include:



Investing in commodities such as gems and gold that can be moved easily to other jurisdictions;
Discreetly investing in and selling valuable assets such as real estate, cars, and boats;
Gambling and laundering money at casinos;
Counterfeiting; and
Using shell companies (inactive companies or corporations that essentially exist on paper only).


   What Is Electronic Money Laundering?  

The Internet has put a new spin on the old crime. The rise of online banking institutions, anonymous online payment services, and peer-to-peer (P2P) transfers with mobile phones have made detecting the illegal transfer of money even more difficult. Moreover, the use of proxy servers and anonymizing software makes the third component of money laundering, integration, almost impossible to detect—money can be transferred or withdrawn with little or no trace of an Internet protocol (IP) address.



Money also can be laundered through online auctions and sales, gambling websites, and virtual gaming sites, where ill-gotten money is converted into gaming currency, then back into real, usable, and untraceable “clean” money.



The newest frontier of money laundering involves cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin. While not totally anonymous, they are increasingly being used in blackmail schemes, the drug trade, and other criminal activities due to their relative anonymity compared with more conventional forms of currency.






AML laws have been slow to catch up to newer types of cybercrimes, since most of the laws are still based on detecting dirty money as it passes through traditional banking institutions and channels.


   How to Prevent Money Laundering  

Governments around the world have stepped up their efforts to combat money laundering in recent decades, with regulations that require financial institutions to put systems in place to detect and report suspicious activity. The amount of money involved is substantial. According to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, global money-laundering transactions account for roughly $800 billion to $2 trillion annually, or some 2% to 5% of global gross domestic product (GDP), although it is difficult to estimate the total amount due to the clandestine nature of money laundering.



In 1989, the Group of Seven (G-7) formed an international committee called the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) in an attempt to fight money laundering on an international scale. In the early 2000s, its purview was expanded to combating the financing of terrorism.



The United States passed the Bank Secrecy Act in 1970, requiring financial institutions to report certain transactions, such as cash transactions above $10,000 or any others that they deem suspicious, on a suspicious activity report (SAR) to the Department of the Treasury. The information that the banks provide to the Treasury Department is used by the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), which can share it with domestic criminal investigators, international bodies, or foreign financial intelligence units.



While these laws were helpful in tracking criminal activity, money laundering itself wasn’t made illegal in the United States until 1986, with the passage of the Money Laundering Control Act. Shortly after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, the USA Patriot Act expanded money-laundering efforts by allowing investigative tools designed for the prevention of organized crime and drug trafficking to be used in terrorist investigations.



The Association of Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialists (ACAMS) offers a professional designation known as a Certified Anti-Money Laundering Specialist (CAMS). Individuals who earn CAMS certification may work as brokerage compliance managers, Bank Secrecy Act officers, financial intelligence unit managers, surveillance analysts, and financial crimes investigative analysts.




Why Is It Important to Combat Money Laundering?
Anti-money laundering (AML) seeks to deprive criminals of the profits from their illegal enterprises, thus eliminating the main motivation for them to engage in such nefarious activities. Illegal and dangerous activities, such as drug trafficking, people smuggling, terrorism funding, smuggling, extortion, and fraud, endanger millions of people globally and impose tremendous social and economic costs upon society. As the proceeds of such activities are legitimized by money laundering, combating money laundering may result in a reduction in criminal activity and hence a significant benefit to society.




What Is an Example of Money Laundering?
Say that cash has been earned illegally from selling drugs, and the drug dealer wishes to buy a new car with the proceeds. Because it is difficult and suspicious to try to purchase a vehicle entirely in cash, the dealer needs to launder the money to have it appear legitimate. The drug dealer also owns a small laundromat, a highly cash-intensive business. The cash from the drug deal is mingled with the laundromat's cash and then taken to a bank for deposit. Then, drawing a check from the laundromat's account, the dealer is able to buy the car without suspicion.Another common form of money laundering in casinos is to buy chips from the casino with cash, and to receive checks in return for the chips from the casino, often without gambling at all or placing minimal bets.




How Can You Tell If Someone Is Laundering Money?
There are several red flags to look out for that may point to money laundering. Some of these include suspicious or secretive behavior by an individual around money matters, making large transactions with cash, owning a company that seems to serve no real purpose, conducting overly-complex transactions, or making several transaction just under the reporting threshold.




What Are Some Ways in Which Real Estate Is Used for Money Laundering?
Some common methods used by criminals for money laundering through real estate transactions include undervaluation or overvaluation of properties, buying and selling properties in rapid succession, using third parties or companies that distance the transaction from the criminal source of funds, and private sales.




How Are Cryptocurrencies Being Used in Money Laundering?
The U.S. Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) noted in a June 2021 report that convertible virtual currencies (CVCs)—another term for cryptocurrencies—have grown to become the currency of choice in a wide range of online illicit activities. Apart from being the preferred form of payment for buying ransomware tools and services, online exploitative material, drugs, and other illegal goods online, CVCs are increasingly used to layer transactions and obfuscate the origin of money derived from criminal activity. Criminals use a number of money-laundering techniques involving cryptocurrencies, including “mixers” and “tumblers” that break the connection between an address (or crypto “wallet”) sending cryptocurrency and the address receiving it.
What Is Money Management?  

Money management refers to the processes of budgeting, saving, investing, spending, or otherwise overseeing the capital usage of an individual or group. The term can also refer more narrowly to investment management and portfolio management.



The predominant use of the phrase in financial markets is that of an investment professional making investment decisions for large pools of funds, such as mutual funds or pension plans.





Key Takeaways

Money management broadly refers to the processes utilized to record and administer an individual’s, household’s, or organization’s finances.The term also refers more narrowly to investment and portfolio management.Financial advisors and personal finance platforms such as mobile apps are increasingly common in helping individuals manage their money better.Poor money management can lead to cycles of debt and financial strain.The biggest money managers by assets under management (AUM) are BlackRock, Vanguard, and Fidelity.


   Understanding Money Management  

Money management is a broad term that involves and incorporates services and solutions across the entire investment industry.



Consumers have access to a wide range of resources and applications that allow them to individually manage nearly every aspect of their personal finances. As investors increase their net worth, they also often seek the services of financial advisors for professional money management. Financial advisors are typically associated with private banking and brokerage services, offering support for holistic money management plans that can involve estate planning, retirement, and more.






In the growing financial technology market, personal finance apps exist to help consumers with nearly every aspect of their finances.



Investment company money management is also a central aspect of the investment industry. Investment company money management offers individual consumers investment fund options that encompass all investable asset classes in the financial market.



Investment company money managers also support the capital management of institutional clients, with investment solutions for institutional retirement plans, endowments, foundations, and more.


   Top Money Managers by Assets  

Global investment managers offer retail and institutional investment management funds and services that encompass every investment asset class in the industry. Two of the most popular types of funds include actively managed funds and passively managed funds. Passively managed funds replicate specified indexes and usually charge low management fees.



The list below shows the top global money managers by assets under management (AUM):


  BlackRock Inc.  

In 1988, BlackRock Inc. was launched as a $1 division of the BlackRock Group. By the end of 1993, it boasted $17 billion in AUM, and, by 2022, that number swelled to a whopping $8.6 trillion.



BlackRock’s exchange-traded fund (ETF) division, called iShares, has about $2.5 trillion in AUM globally, amounting to roughly 29% of the group’s total assets. Overall, the firm employs approximately 13,000 professionals and maintains offices in more than 30 countries around the world.


  The Vanguard Group  

The Vanguard Group is one of the most well-known investment management companies, catering to more than 30 million clients across 170 countries. Vanguard was founded by John C. Bogle in 1975 in Valley Forge, Pennsylvania, as a division of Wellington Management Co., where Bogle was previously chair.



Since its launch, Vanguard has grown its total assets to beyond $8 trillion, becoming the world’s second-largest asset manager thanks to the popularity of its low-cost investment funds.


  Fidelity Investments  

Fidelity Management & Research Co. was founded in 1946 by Edward C. Johnson II. As of Dec. 31, 2022, Fidelity had more than 40 million customers with $10.3 trillion in total assets and $3.9 trillion in AUM.



The firm offers hundreds of mutual funds, including domestic equity, foreign equity, sector-specific, fixed-income, index, money market, and asset allocation funds.




What is the difference between a money manager and an asset manager?
As implied in their respective names, money managers manage money and asset managers manage assets. However, as assets essentially represent money, the two can largely be considered the same thing.




What are the main principles of money management?
The main principles of money management are generally income, investing, savings, and spending. With the right balance, these principles can help individuals to maximize their financial well-being.




What is the goal of money management?
The ultimate goal of money management is to maximize wealth.


   The Bottom Line  

Money management is precisely that: the management of money. When people talk about money management, they may be referring to how an individual or company handles their finances, whether that be budgeting, saving, investing, or spending. Alternatively, they could be referring to the companies that many people count on to manage their capital.



In financial markets, the term “money management” is generally synonymous with big investment firms, or asset managers, taking people’s money and investing it. The biggest money managers in the world are BlackRock, Vanguard, and Fidelity. Among them, they oversee many of the largest, most well-known mutual funds and pension plans.
What Is a Money Manager?  

A money manager is a person or financial firm that manages the securities portfolio of an individual or institutional investor. Typically, a money manager employs people with various expertise ranging from research and selection of investment options to monitoring the assets and deciding when to sell them.



In return for a fee, the money manager has the fiduciary duty to choose and manage investments prudently for clients, including developing an appropriate investment strategy and buying and selling securities to meet those goals. A money manager may also be known as a "portfolio manager," "asset manager," or "investment manager."





Key Takeaways

A money manager is a person or financial firm that manages the securities portfolio of individual or institutional investors.Professional money managers do not receive commissions on transactions; rather, they are paid based on a percentage of assets under management.A money manager has the fiduciary duty to choose and manage investments in a way that puts clients' interests first, last, and always.


   How a Money Manager Works  

Money managers provide their clients with personalized service, an individualized portfolio, and ongoing management. With fee-based management, as opposed to transaction-based management, the client and his or her adviser are on the same side, which means clients no longer have to question the decisions of a broker to buy or sell their securities. A professional money manager does not receive commissions on transactions and is paid based on a percentage of assets under management. Thus, it is in the best interest of both the money manager and client to see the portfolio grow.


   Reasons to Use a Money Manager  

A professionally trained money manager has the expertise to select the most appropriate investments for his or her client’s portfolio. Money managers typically hold a Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA) designation that helps them assess a company’s fundamentals by analyzing their financial statements. A money manager may also have expertise in a specific sector. For example, the manager may have previously held roles in the automotive industry that provides an edge when selecting auto stocks.



Money managers have access to a plethora of information and tools such as interviews with company executives, research reports, analytics data, and advanced financial modeling software. Having these resources allows money managers to make investment decisions that have a higher probability of success. For instance, a money manager might discover that a company has a unique competitive advantage after interviewing its CEO.

   How Is a Money Manager Paid?  

Money managers typically charge management fees ranging from 0.5% to 2% per annum, depending on the portfolio size. For example, an asset management firm may charge a 1% management fee on a $1 million portfolio. In dollar terms, this equals a $10,000 management fee. ($1,000,000 x 1 / 100). Asset managers and hedge funds may also charge a performance fee, which is remuneration for generating positive returns. Performance fees typically range between 10% and 20% of the fund’s profit. For instance, if the fund charges a 10% performance fee and returns $250,000 profit, the client pays an additional $25,000 in fees ($250,000 x 10 / 100).


   Real-Life Example of a Money Manager  

Examples of leading money management firms that accept retail investors' funds include Vanguard Group Inc., Pacific Investment Management Co. (PIMCO), and J.P. Morgan Asset Management.



Famous individual money managers include Warren Buffett of Berkshire Hathaway and Bruce Berkowitz of the Fairholme Fund.
What Is the Money Market?  

The money market refers to trading in very short-term debt investments. At the wholesale level, it involves large-volume trades between institutions and traders. At the retail level, it includes money market mutual funds bought by individual investors and money market accounts opened by bank customers.



In all of these cases, the money market is characterized by a high degree of safety and relatively low rates of return.





Key Takeaways

The money market involves the purchase and sale of large volumes of very short-term debt products, such as overnight reserves or commercial paper.An individual may invest in the money market by purchasing a money market mutual fund, buying a Treasury bill, or opening a money market account at a bank.Money market investments are characterized by safety and liquidity, with money market fund shares targeted at $1.Money market accounts offer higher interest rates than a normal savings account, but there are higher account minimums and limits on withdrawals.


   Understanding the Money Market  

The money market is one of the pillars of the global financial system. It involves overnight swaps of vast amounts of money between banks and the U.S. government. The majority of money market transactions are wholesale transactions that take place between financial institutions and companies.



Institutions that participate in the money market include banks that lend to one another and to large companies in the eurocurrency and time deposit markets; companies that raise money by selling commercial paper into the market, which can be bought by other companies or funds; and investors who purchase bank CDs as a safe place to park money in the short term. Some of those wholesale transactions eventually make their way into the hands of consumers as components of money market mutual funds and other investments.






   Who Uses the Money Market?  

In the wholesale market, commercial paper is a popular borrowing mechanism because the interest rates are higher than for bank time deposits or Treasury bills, and a greater range of maturities is available, from overnight to 270 days. However, the risk of default is significantly higher for commercial paper than for bank or government instruments.



Individuals can invest in the money market by buying money market funds, short-term certificates of deposit (CDs), municipal notes, or U.S. Treasury bills. For individual investors, the money market has retail locations, including local banks and the U.S. government's TreasuryDirect website. Brokers are another avenue for investing in the money market.



The U.S. government issues Treasury bills in the money market, with maturities ranging from a few days to one year. Primary dealers buy them in large amounts directly from the government to trade between themselves or to sell to individual investors. Individual investors can buy them directly from the government through its TreasuryDirect website or through a bank or a broker. State, county, and municipal governments also issue short-term notes.



Money market funds seek stability and security with the goal of never losing money and keeping net asset value (NAV) at $1. This one-buck NAV baseline gives rise to the phrase "break the buck," meaning that if the value falls below the $1 NAV level, some of the original investment is gone and investors will lose money. However, this scenario only happens very rarely, but because many money market funds are not FDIC-insured, meaning that money market funds can nevertheless lose money.


   Types of Money Market Instruments  
  Money Market Funds  

The wholesale money market is limited to companies and financial institutions that lend and borrow in amounts ranging from $5 million to well over $1 billion per transaction. Mutual funds offer baskets of these products to individual investors. The net asset value (NAV) of such funds is intended to stay at $1.



During the 2008 financial crisis, one fund fell below that level. That triggered market panic and a mass exodus from the funds, which ultimately led to additional restrictions on their access to riskier investments.


  Money Market Accounts   

Money market accounts are a type of savings account. They pay interest, but some issuers offer account holders limited rights to occasionally withdraw money or write checks against the account. (Withdrawals are limited by federal regulations. If they are exceeded, the bank promptly converts it to a checking account.) Banks typically calculate interest on a money market account on a daily basis and make a monthly credit to the account.



In general, money market accounts offer slightly higher interest rates than standard savings accounts. But the difference in rates between savings and money market accounts has narrowed considerably since the 2008 financial crisis.



Average interest rates for money market accounts often vary based on the amount deposited. As of June 2023, the best-paying money market account with a no minimum deposit offered 5% annualized interest.



Given today's high interest rate market, money market accounts have become more popular because of their perceived their safety when compared to more volatile investments, such as stocks.






Funds in money market accounts are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) at banks and the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) in credit unions. 


  Certificates of Deposit (CDs)  

Most certificates of deposit (CDs) are not strictly money market funds because they are sold with terms of up to 10 years. However, CDs with terms as short as three months to six months are available.



As with money market accounts, bigger deposits and longer terms yield better interest rates. Rates in June 2023 for 12-month CDs ranged from about 4.90% to 5.15% depending on the size of the deposit. Unlike a money market account, the rates offered with a CD remain constant for the deposit period. There is usually a penalty associated with an early withdrawal of funds deposited in a CD.



CDs have also gained in popularity recently due to their safety and currently high rates.


  Commercial Paper  

The commercial paper market is for buying and selling unsecured loans for corporations in need of a short-term cash infusion. Only highly creditworthy companies participate, so the risks are low.


  Banker's Acceptances  

The banker's acceptance is a short-term loan that is guaranteed by a bank. Used extensively in foreign trade, a banker's acceptance is like a post-dated check and serves as a guarantee that an importer can pay for the goods. There is a secondary market for buying and selling banker's acceptances at a discount.


  Eurodollars  

Eurodollars are dollar-denominated deposits held in foreign banks, and are thus, not subject to Federal Reserve regulations. Very large deposits of eurodollars are held in banks in the Cayman Islands and the Bahamas. Money market funds, foreign banks, and large corporations invest in them because they pay a slightly higher interest rate than U.S. government debt.


  Repos  

The repo, or repurchase agreement (repo), is part of the overnight lending money market. Treasury bills or other government securities are sold to another party with an agreement to repurchase them at a set price on a set date.


   Money Markets vs. Capital Markets  

The money market is defined as dealing in debt of less than one year. It is primarily used by governments and corporations to keep their cash flow steady, and for investors to make a modest profit.



The capital market is dedicated to the sale and purchase of long-term debt and equity instruments. The term "capital markets" refers to the entirety of the stock and bond markets. While anyone can buy and sell a stock in a fraction of a second these days, companies that issue stock do so for the purpose of raising money for their long-term operations. While a stock's value may fluctuate, unlike many money market products, it has no expiration date (unless, of course, the company itself ceases to operate).


   Advantages and Disadvantages of Money Markets  

There are several pros and cons of money market investments. Most money market securities are considered extremely low-risk, due to the protection of FDIC insurance, backing by a government or bank, or the high creditworthiness of the borrowers. They are also very liquid, meaning that they can readily be exchanged for cash at short notice.



The tradeoff of having low risk is that these investments also have low returns. Not only do money markets underperform other asset classes, they often don't even keep pace with inflation. In addition, any fees associated with an account can easily eat into those slim returns.



Moreover, these advantages do not extend to all money market securities. Some of them are not FDIC insured, and there is a (small) chance that even the most trustworthy borrowers may default. Some money market accounts have minimum balance requirements or restrictions on withdrawals.




Pros and Cons of Money Market Accounts

Pros

Extremely low risk.
May be insured by FDIC.
Highly liquid.
Higher returns than most bank accounts.



Cons

Low returns that may not keep pace with inflation.
Not all money market securities are insured.
May have high minimum investments or withdrawal restrictions.







Why Is It Called the Money Market?
The money market refers to the market for highly liquid, very safe, short-term debt securities. Because of these attributes, they are often seen as cash equivalents that can be interchangeable for money at short notice.




Why Is the Money Market Important?
The money market is crucial for the smooth functioning of a modern financial economy. It allows savers to lend money to those in need of short-term loans and allocates capital towards its most productive use. These loans, often made overnight or for a matter of days or weeks, are needed by governments, corporations, and banks in order to meet their near-term obligations or regulatory requirements. At the same time, it allows those with excess cash on hand to earn interest.




What Are Some Examples of Money Market Instruments?
The money market is composed of several types of securities including short-term Treasuries (e.g. T-bills), certificates of deposit (CDs), commercial paper, repurchase agreements (repos), and money market mutual funds that invest in these instruments. The money market funds typically have shares that are always priced at $1.




Can You Lose Money in the Money Market?
For depositors, most money market accounts are insured by the FDIC up to $250,000 per institution. Because money market instruments are very low risk, there is virtually no chance you will lose your money by owning a CD or T-bill either. During periods of extreme financial stress, for example, during the height of the 2008 financial crisis, some money market funds did "break the buck" and briefly incur losses, but this was quickly corrected.




What Are the Downsides of Money Markets?
Because they are virtually risk-free, money market investments also come with very low interest rates - often the risk-free rate of return. As a result, they will not provide substantial capital gains or investment growth compared to riskier assets like bonds or stocks. Some types of money market accounts, like CDs, furthermore can lock your money up until it matures, which can range from months to years.


   The Bottom Line  

Money market accounts and money market funds are considered among the safest ways to invest one's money. They also have much lower returns than other investments, often even less than inflation. Because they are so low risk, many people and businesses use money markets as a short-term investment for their cash reserves.
What Is a Money Market Account (MMA)?  

The term money market account (MMA) refers to an interest-bearing account at a bank or credit union. Sometimes referred to as money market deposit accounts (MMDA), money market accounts have some features that are not found in other types of accounts. Most money market accounts pay a higher interest rate than regular (passbook) savings accounts and often include check-writing and debit card privileges. They may also come with restrictions that make them less flexible than a regular checking account. They are important for calculating tangible net worth.





Key Takeaways

Money market accounts are offered by banks and credit unions and provide the benefits and features of both savings and checking accounts. They generally pay higher interest rates than regular savings accounts and may come with debit cards and limited check-writing privileges.MMAs are suited for short-term goals rather than long-term financial planning.Many banks also offer high-yield or high-interest checking accounts, which may pay better rates than money market accounts but impose more restrictions.Alternatives to MMAs include high-yield savings accounts and certificates of deposit.

   How Money Market Accounts (MMAs) Work  

Money market accounts are financial products that are offered to customers at traditional and online banks and at credit unions. They give account holders some of the key benefits of a savings account while providing them with the features of a checking account, including:



Interest: Like savings accounts, MMAs allow account owners to earn interest on their balances. The interest rate offered is normally higher than a traditional savings account. The interest rate, though, tends to be variable, which means it fluctuates as market conditions rise and fall.
Debit Cards: Some banks include a debit card with the account, which allows owners to use automated teller machines (ATMs) to make deposits, withdrawals, and transfers.
Check-Writing: Along with debit cards, clients may also be able to write checks against their account balances.



Banks often require a minimum initial deposit in order to open an MMA and balances must be maintained over a certain threshold while they are active. Banks may impose a service charge if the balance falls below that minimum amount.



Money market accounts are suited for individuals who want to earn more interest than they would with a savings account with short-term goals in mind. As such, an MMA may be a good idea if you're saving up for a specific purchase, such as a vacation, the down payment for a car, or for a rainy day or emergency fund. They are not intended for long-term purposes like retirement.


   History of Money Market Accounts (MMAs)  

Until the early 1980s, the federal government placed a cap or limit on the amount of interest that banks and credit unions could offer customers on their savings accounts.



Many institutions gave out small appliances (such as toasters and waffle irons), and other incentives to attract deposits because they couldn’t compete with money market mutual funds when it came to interest rates.



Introduced in the 1970s, money market mutual funds are sold by brokerages and mutual fund companies. Under pressure from the banking industry, Congress passed the Garn-St. Germain Depository Institutions Act in 1982. This new law allowed banks and credit unions to offer money market accounts that paid a “money market” rate, which was higher than the previous capped rate.


   Advantages and Disadvantages of Money Market Accounts (MMAs)  

There are advantages and disadvantages to having a money market account, especially when you compare them to other types of accounts.



Their advantages include higher interest rates, check-writing, and debit card privileges. Banks and credit unions generally require customers to deposit a certain amount of money to open an account and to keep their account balance above a certain level. Many impose monthly fees if the balance falls below the minimum.



These accounts also provide federal insurance protection. Accounts held at banks are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) while those held at credit unions are insured by National Credit Union Administration (NCUA). The FDIC and NCUA cover certain types of accounts, including MMAs, up to $250,000 per depositor per bank. Multiple insurable accounts at the same bank (checking, savings, certificate of deposit) count toward the $250,000 insurance limit. Joint accounts are insured for $500,000.



Potential disadvantages include limited transactions, fees, and minimum balance requirements.





Pros

Higher interest rates
Check-writing privileges
Debit cards
Insurance protection



Cons

Limited transactions
Fees
Minimum balance requirement









For depositors who want to insure more than $250,000, the easiest way to accomplish that is to open accounts at more than one bank or credit union.


   Money Market Accounts (MMAs) vs. Savings Accounts  

One of the attractions of money market accounts is that they offer higher interest rates than savings accounts. For example, the average interest rate for an MMA in May 2022 was 0.08% while the average savings account paid about 0.07%.



When overall interest rates are higher, as they were during the 1980s, 1990s, and much of the 2000s, the gap between the two types of accounts will be wider. Money market accounts can offer higher interest rates because they're permitted to invest in certificates of deposit (CDs), government securities, and commercial paper, which savings accounts cannot do.



The interest rates on money market accounts are variable, so they rise or fall with inflation. How that interest is compounded—yearly, monthly or daily, for example—can have a substantial impact on the depositor's return, especially if they maintain a high balance in their account.



Unlike savings accounts, many money market accounts offer some check-writing privileges and also provide a debit card with the account, much like a regular checking account.






The lines between high-yield savings accounts and money market accounts are increasingly blurred, and you may want to compare both money market accounts and savings account rates to ensure you're picking the best product for you.


   Money Market Accounts (MMAs) vs. Checking Accounts  

Money market and checking accounts share some basic characteristics—the same way they do with savings accounts. Account-holders can make unlimited deposits. Some of them even offer debit cards, which allow account owners to make point-of-sale (POS) transactions. They can also write checks against an MMA, too.



In April 2020, the Federal Reserve lifted restrictions set for accounts like MMAs under Regulation D. Prior to this, depositors were limited to a total of six transfers and electronic payments per month. The types of transfers affected were pre-authorized transfers (including overdraft protection), telephone transfers, electronic transfers, checks or debit card payments to third parties, ACH transactions, and wire transfers. Depositors who exceeded the limits were fined.



Although the rules were amended under federal regulations, some banks may still impose limitations and restrictions on how their MMAs may be used. As such, it's important to check with your financial institution about the rules.


   Money Market Accounts (MMAs) vs. Mutual Funds  

Unlike the various bank and credit union accounts described above, money market mutual funds, offered by brokerage firms and mutual fund companies, are not FDIC- or NCUA-insured. (Banks may also offer mutual funds, but they aren't insured, either.) However, because they invest in safe short-term vehicles such as CDs, government securities, and commercial paper, they are considered to be very low risk.



Both money market accounts and money market mutual funds offer quick access to the depositor's cash. The companies that offer them, however, can place limits on how often depositors can make withdrawals or redeem shares. Others may require that any checks they write be for over a certain amount. The returns on money market mutual funds tend to be higher than those on money market accounts.



The table below compares some of the common features found in money market accounts and other types of deposit accounts. Because interest rates and other provisions can vary from one financial institution to another, it's worth shopping around.

Don't confuse a money market account with a money market mutual fund. They're two different beasts. While a money market account is a type of deposit account, a money market mutual fund is a mutual fund that invests in highly liquid short-term assets.


   Alternatives to Money Market Accounts (MMAs)  

Banks and credit unions offer many types of accounts, some with features that can make them competitive with—or superior to—money market accounts.


  Passbook Savings Accounts  

Unlike money market accounts, regular savings accounts typically have no initial deposit or minimum balance requirements. They also pay interest, although usually not as much as a money market account. Like money market accounts, passbook savings accounts are FDIC- or NCUA-insured. Check with your bank to see if there are any restrictions on withdrawals.


  High-Yield Savings Accounts  

Many banks and credit unions also offer high-yield savings accounts and, depending on the institution, the interest rate may be better than on their money market accounts. High-yield savings accounts are also FDIC- or NCUA-insured. A potential downside compared with money market accounts is that they may have more rules, such as requiring direct deposits.


  Regular Checking Accounts  

Checking accounts have one big advantage over their money market cousins—unlimited transactions, including checks, ATM withdrawals, wire transfers, and so forth. They are also FDIC- or NCUA-insured. Their main disadvantage is that they pay a very low (often zero) interest rate.


  High-Yield/High-Interest Checking Accounts  

Like high-yield savings accounts, these accounts offer interest rates that rival and sometimes exceed those of money market accounts. They also share the high-yield savings accounts' principal weakness, which is that they may have more complicated requirements, such as a minimum number of debit transactions each month.



They also impose a cap—for example, $5,000—above which the high-interest rate does not apply. In other respects, high-yield checking is like regular checking, with unlimited checks, a debit card, ATM access, and FDIC or NCUA insurance. 


  Rewards Checking Account  

This type of checking account may offer a sign-up bonus and other rewards, such as high yields, ATM fee reimbursements, airline miles, or cashback. The main downside is similar to high-yield checking—notably, high fees unless the depositor satisfies all the rules, which vary by the institution. Otherwise, rewards checking functions like a regular checking account, including FDIC or NCUA insurance.


  Certificates of Deposit (CDs)  

A CD is like a savings account with a fixed duration, such as three, six, nine, or 12 months, or multiple years up to 10. In exchange for locking in their money for that period of time, depositors generally get a higher rate of interest than they would with a regular savings account. However, if they withdraw their money (or part of it) early, they'll pay a penalty, usually in the form of lost interest.



Some CDs (known as liquid CDs) don’t penalize depositors for early withdrawals but pay a lower rate of interest. CDs are FDIC- or NCUA-insured but typically offer no provision to write checks, withdraw funds with a debit card, or add to the balance after the initial purchase.


   Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)  


Are Money Market Accounts Safe?
Money market accounts at a bank are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, an independent agency of the federal government. The FDIC covers certain types of accounts, including MMAs, up to $250,000 per depositor per bank. If the depositor has other insurable accounts at the same bank (checking, savings, certificate of deposit), they all count toward the $250,000 insurance limit. For depositors who want to insure more than $250,000, the easiest way to accomplish that is to open accounts at more than one bank or credit union. Joint accounts are insured for $500,000.




What Are the Benefits of Money Market Accounts?
Some of the benefits of MMAs include higher interest rates, insurance protection, check-writing, and debit card privileges. The lure of higher interest rates than savings accounts is one of the main attractions of MMAs. They are able to offer higher interest rates because they're permitted to invest in certificates of deposit, government securities, and commercial paper, which savings accounts cannot do. These accounts also offer easy access to funds as well as the flexibility to transfer funds between multiple accounts at the same institution. And unlike savings accounts, many MMAs offer some check-writing privileges and also provide a debit card with the account, much like a regular checking account.




What Are the Disadvantages of MMAs?
Potential disadvantages include limited transactions, fees, withdrawal restrictions, and minimum balance requirements. Banks and credit unions generally require customers to deposit a certain amount of money to open an account and to keep their account balance above a certain level. Many will impose monthly fees if the balance falls below the minimum. While some MMAs offer attractive rates, most will not be able to compete with other higher-yielding alternatives. Banks and credit unions offer many types of accounts, some with features that can make them competitive with—or superior to—money market accounts. Although the Federal Reserve amended withdrawal restrictions, banks may limit the amount of times that depositors can take money out of their MMAs.
What Is a Money Market Fund?  

A money market fund is a kind of mutual fund that invests in highly liquid, near-term instruments. These instruments include cash, cash equivalent securities, and high-credit-rating, debt-based securities with a short-term maturity (such as U.S. Treasuries). Money market funds are intended to offer investors high liquidity with a very low level of risk. Money market funds are also called money market mutual funds.



While they sound similar in name, a money market fund is not the same as a money market account (MMA). A money market fund is an investment that is sponsored by an investment fund company. Therefore, it carries no guarantee of principal. A money market account is a type of interest-earning savings account. Money market accounts are offered by financial institutions. They are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), and they typically have limited transaction privileges.





Key Takeaways

A money market fund is a type of mutual fund that invests in high-quality, short-term debt instruments, cash, and cash equivalents.Though not quite as safe as cash, money market funds are considered extremely low-risk on the investment spectrum. A money market fund generates income (taxable or tax-free, depending on its portfolio), but little capital appreciation.Money market funds should be used as a place to park money temporarily before investing elsewhere or making an anticipated cash outlay; they are not suitable as long-term investments.






   How a Money Market Fund Works  

Money market funds work like a typical mutual fund. They issue redeemable units or shares to investors, and they are mandated to follow the guidelines drafted by financial regulators (for example, those set by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission).



A money market fund may invest in the following types of debt-based financial instruments:



Bankers' Acceptances (BA)—short-term debt guaranteed by a commercial bank
Certificates of deposit (CDs)—bank-issued savings certificate with short-term maturity
Commercial paper—unsecured short-term corporate debt
Repurchase agreements (Repo)—short-term government securities
U.S. Treasuries—short-term government debt issues



Returns from these instruments are dependent on the applicable market interest rates, and therefore, the overall returns from the money market funds are also dependent on interest rates.

Money market funds are classified into various types depending upon the class of invested assets, the maturity period, and other attributes.


  Prime Money Fund  

A prime money fund invests in floating-rate debt and commercial paper of non-Treasury assets, like those issued by corporations, U.S. government agencies, and government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs).


  Government Money Fund  

A government money fund invests at least 99.5% of its total assets in cash, government securities, and repurchase agreements that are fully collateralized by cash or government securities.


  Treasury Fund  

A Treasury fund invests in standard U.S. Treasury-issued debt securities, such as Treasury bills, Treasury bonds, and Treasury notes.


  Tax-Exempt Money Fund  

A tax-exempt money fund offers earnings that are free from U.S. federal income tax. Depending on the exact securities it invests in, a tax-exempt money fund may also have an exemption from state income taxes. Municipal bonds and other debt securities primarily constitute such types of money market funds.



Some money market funds are targeted to attract institutional money with a high minimum investment amount (oftentimes $1 million). Still, other money market funds are retail money funds and are accessible to individual investors as a result of their small minimums.


   Special Considerations  
  The Net Asset Value (NAV) Standard  

All the features of a standard mutual fund apply to a money market fund, with one key difference. A money market fund aims to maintain a net asset value (NAV) of $1 per share. Any excess earnings that get generated through interest on the portfolio holdings are distributed to the investors in the form of dividend payments. Investors can purchase or redeem shares of money market funds through investment fund companies, brokerage firms, and banks.



One of the primary reasons for the popularity of money market funds is their maintenance of the $1 NAV. This requirement forces the fund managers to make regular payments to investors, providing a regular flow of income for them. It also allows easy calculations and tracking of the net gains the fund generates.


  Breaking the Buck  

Occasionally, a money market fund may fall below the $1 NAV. This creates a condition that is sometimes referred to with the colloquial term "breaking the buck." When this condition occurs, it may be attributed to temporary price fluctuations in the money markets. However, if it persists, the condition may trigger a moment when the investment income of the money market fund fails to exceed its operating expenses or investment losses.



For example, if the fund used excess leverage in purchasing instruments—or overall interest rates dropped to very low levels nearing zero—and the fund broke the buck, then one of these scenarios could lead to a condition where the fund cannot meet redemption requests. If this happens, regulators may jump in and force the fund's liquidation. However, instances of breaking the buck are very rare.



In 1994, the first instance of breaking the buck occurred. The Community Bankers U.S. Government Money Market Fund was liquidated at $0.96 per share. This was the result of large losses that the fund incurred following a period of heavy investment in derivatives.



In 2008, following the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers, the venerable Reserve Primary Fund also broke the buck. The fund held millions of the Lehman Brothers debt obligations, and panicked redemptions by its investors caused its NAV to fall to $0.97 per share. The pullout of money caused the Reserve Primary Fund to liquidate. This event triggered mayhem throughout the money markets.



To prevent this from happening again, in 2010—in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis—the SEC issued new rules to better manage money market funds. These rules were intended to provide more stability and resilience by placing tighter restrictions on portfolio holdings and introducing provisions for imposing liquidity fees and suspending redemptions.


  Regulation of Money Market Funds  

In the U.S., money market funds are under the purview of the SEC. This regulatory body defines the necessary guidelines for the characteristics, maturity, and variety of allowable investments in a money market fund.



Under the provisions, a money fund mainly invests in the top-rated debt instruments, and they should have a maturity period under 13 months. The money market fund portfolio is required to maintain a weighted average maturity (WAM) period of 60 days or less. This WAM requirement means that the average maturity period of all the invested instruments—taken in proportion to their weights in the fund portfolio—should not be more than 60 days. This maturity limitation is done to ensure that only highly liquid instruments qualify for investments, and the investor’s money is not locked into long-maturity instruments that can mar the liquidity.



A money market fund is not allowed to invest more than 5% in any one issuer (in order to avoid issuer-specific risk). However, government-issued securities and repurchase agreements provide an exception to this rule.


   Advantages and Disadvantages of Money Market Funds  

Money market funds compete against similar investment options, such as bank money market accounts, ultrashort bond funds, and enhanced cash funds. These investment options may invest in a wider variety of assets, as well as aim for higher returns.



The primary purpose of a money market fund is to provide investors with a safe avenue for investing in secure and highly liquid, cash-equivalent, debt-based assets using smaller investment amounts. In the realm of mutual-fund-like investments, money market funds are characterized as low-risk, low-return investments.



Many investors prefer to park substantial amounts of cash in such funds for the short term. However, money market funds are not suitable for long term investment goals, like retirement planning. This is because they don’t offer much capital appreciation.



Money market funds appear attractive to investors as they come with no loads—no entry charges or exit charges. Many funds also provide investors with tax-advantaged gains by investing in municipal securities that are tax-exempt at the federal tax level (and in some instances at the state level, too).





Pros

Very low-risk
Highly liquid
Better returns than bank accounts



Cons

Not FDIC-insured
No capital appreciation
Sensitive to interest rate fluctuations, monetary policy






It's important to keep in mind that money market funds are not covered by the FDIC's federal deposit insurance, while money market deposit accounts, online savings accounts, and certificates of deposit, are covered by this type of insurance. Like other investment securities, money market funds are regulated under the Investment Company Act of 1940.



An active investor who has time and knowledge to hunt around for the best possible short-term debt instruments—offering the best possible interest rates at their preferred levels of risk—may prefer investing on their own in the various available instruments. On the other hand, a less-savvy investor may prefer taking the money market fund route by delegating the money management task to the fund operators.



Fund shareholders can typically withdraw their money at any time, but they may have a limit on the number of times they can withdraw within a certain period.


   History of Money Market Funds  

Money market funds were designed and launched during the early 1970s in the U.S. They gained rapid popularity because they were an easy way for investors to purchase a pool of securities that, in general, offered better returns than those available from a standard interest-bearing bank account.



Commercial paper has become a common component of many money market funds. Previously, money market funds held only government bonds. However, this transition away from only government bonds resulted in higher yields. At the same time, it was this reliance on commercial paper that led to the Reserve Primary Fund crisis.



In addition to the reforms that the SEC introduced in 2010, the SEC also implemented some fundamental structural changes to the way they regulate money market funds in 2016.



These changes required prime institutional money market funds to float their NAV and no longer maintain a stable price. Retail and U.S. government money market funds were allowed to maintain the stable $1 per share policy. The regulations also provided non-government money market fund boards with new tools to address runs.


  Money Market Funds Today  

Today, money market funds have become one of the core pillars of the present-day capital markets. For investors, they offer a diversified, professionally-managed portfolio with high daily liquidity. Many investors use money market funds as a place to park their cash until they decide on other investments or for funding needs that may arise in the short-term.



The interest rates that are available on the various instruments that constitute the portfolio of a money market fund are the key factors that determine the return from a given money market fund. Looking at historical data is enough to provide sufficient details on how money market returns have fared.



During the decade spanning from 2000 to 2010, the monetary policies of the Federal Reserve Bank led to short-term interest rates—the rates banks pay to borrow money from one another—hovering around 0%. These near-zero rates meant money market fund investors saw returns that were significantly lower, compared to those in the prior decades. Further, with the tightening of regulations after the 2008 financial crisis, the number of investable securities grew smaller.



Another economic policy in recent years that has had an adverse impact on money market funds is quantitative easing (QE). QE is an unconventional monetary policy where a central bank purchases government securities or other securities from the market in order to lower interest rates and increase the money supply.



As major economies across the globe—including the U.S.—followed QE measures in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, a good portion of the QE money made its way into money market mutual funds as a haven. This migration of funds led to interest rates remaining low for a long duration, and the diminishing of returns from money market funds.




Are Money Market Funds Safe?
Yes. For the most part, money market funds are among the safest of all investments, with a target value of $1 per share. Money market funds have only dipped below this value ("broken the buck") on a small number of occasions (associated with financial crises) and have quickly bounced back,




What Was the First Money Market Fund?
The first money market mutual fund appeared in 1971 and was called "The Reserve Fund."




Is a Money Market Account the Same as a Money Market Fund?
No. A money market fund is a mutual fund investment that holds short-term treasuries and other money market instruments. A money market account is a bank product that credits depositors a rate of interest.
What Is the Money Market Yield?  

The money market yield is the interest rate earned by investing in securities with high liquidity and maturities of less than one year, such as negotiable certificates of deposit, U.S. Treasury bills, and municipal notes. Money market yield is calculated by taking the holding period yield and multiplying it by a 360-day bank year divided by days to maturity. It can also be calculated using a bank discount yield.



The money market yield is closely related to the CD-equivalent yield and the bond equivalent yield (BEY).





Key Takeaways

The money market yield is what money market instruments are expected to return to investors.The money market involves the purchase and sale of large volumes of very short-term debt products, such as overnight reserves or commercial paper.An individual may invest in the money market by purchasing a money market mutual fund, buying a Treasury bill, or opening a money market account at a bank.


   Understanding the Money Market Yield  

The money market is the part of the broader financial markets that deals with highly liquid and short-term financial securities. The market links borrowers and lenders who are looking to transact in short-term instruments overnight or for some days, weeks, or months, but always less than a year.



Active participants in this market include banks, money market funds, brokers, and dealers. Examples of money market securities include Certificates of Deposit (CD), Treasury bills (T-bills), commercial paper, municipal notes, short-term asset-backed securities, Eurodollar deposits, and repurchase agreements.



To earn a money market yield, it is thus necessary to have a money market account. Banks, for example, offer money market accounts because they need to borrow funds on a short-term basis to meet reserve requirements and to participate in interbank lending.



Money market investors receive compensation for lending funds to entities that need to fulfill their short-term debt obligations. This compensation is typically in the form of variable interest rates determined by the current interest rate in the economy.



Since money market securities are considered to have low default risk, the money market yield will be lower than the yield on stocks and bonds but higher than the interest rates on standard savings accounts.


   Calculating the Money Market Yield  

Although interest rates are quoted annually, the quoted interest may actually be compounded semi-annually, quarterly, monthly, or even daily. The money market yield is calculated using the bond equivalent yield (BEY) based on a 360-day year, which helps an investor compare the return of a bond that pays a coupon on an annual basis with a bond that pays semi-annual, quarterly, or any other coupons.



The formula for the money market yield is:



Money market yield = Holding period yield x (360/Time to maturity)



Money market yield = [(Face value – Purchase price)/Purchase price] x (360/Time to maturity)



For example, a T-bill with a $100,000 face value is issued for $98,000 and is due to mature in 180 days. The money market yield is:



= ($100,000 - $98,000/$98,000) x 360/180= 0.0204 x 2= 0.0408, or 4.08%



The money market yield differs slightly from the bank discount yield, which is computed on the face value, not the purchase price; however, the money market yield can also be calculated using the bank discount yield as seen in this formula:



Money market yield = Bank discount yield x (Face value/Purchase price)



Money market yield = Bank discount yield / [1 – (Face value – Purchase price/Face value)]



Where bank discount yield = (Face value – Purchase price)/Face value x (360/Time to maturity)




What Is a Typical Money Market Yield?
Money market accounts and instruments typically yield between 0.01% and 4%. This depends on the amount of money deposited, as some institutions require a higher deposit to earn the higher interest rate.




What Is the 7-Day Yield on the Money Market?
The 7-day yield on the money market is a method of estimating the return of money market instruments on an annual basis. It takes the difference between the price today and the price seven days ago and multiplies that by the annualization factor.




What Are the Disadvantages of a Money Market Account?
Some disadvantages of a money market account include a lower yield than some other investment accounts, possible limits on the number of transactions allowed in a certain period, and minimum account balances.


   The Bottom Line  

Investing in money market instruments can be a good way to utilize short-term funds to generate interest income, which is a better use than leaving your cash in a non-interest-bearing or low-interest-bearing vehicle.
What Is a Money Order?  

A money order is a safe alternative to cash or a personal check, usually issued by a government or banking institution, that works similarly to a check. A money order can be cashed or deposited into a bank account.



Money orders are readily accepted and converted to cash and are often used by people without access to a standard checking account. They are an acceptable form of payment for debts, both personal and business, and can be purchased for a small service fee from most institutions. Money orders were first issued by American Express in 1882 and later became popularized as traveler's checks.





Key Takeaways

Money orders are a safe alternative to using cash or checks to pay smaller debts.You can purchase money orders at banks and credit unions, and also at a variety of locations like big-box stores, post offices, and even some gas stations.When you buy or cash a money order, you may have to pay a small fee.If you lose a money order, it usually can be replaced for a fee.International money orders can be an inexpensive way to send money across the border and overseas quickly.


   How Money Orders Work  

If you buy a money order, you will have to fill out the name of the recipient on a form and the amount that the recipient should receive. Most money orders have a maximum limit of $1,000. Therefore, you would need to purchase multiple orders if you need more than that amount. Be sure to fill out the money order carefully; it's a one-off purchase and you need to keep good records of it.



The financial institution or authorized body that issues the money order to the person paying will have the name of the person or entity being paid, the issuer’s name, and the amount of money that can be cashed. This dollar value doesn't include the fees charged. Factor in all costs when purchasing money orders. A bank or credit union normally will charge more than a convenience store to issue money orders.



When you pay for a money order, it comes with a receipt that includes the serial number of the money order. You should keep this information until you're certain the money order has cleared. Without a receipt, tracing a money order can be difficult or even impossible.






A money order is harder to trace than a check, so keep your receipt until you are sure the order has been received and cashed.


   Advantages and Disadvantages of a Money Order  



Advantages

Doesn't include sensitive information
Recipient can cash the order at a local bank or credit union
Can be deposited into a bank account
Can be issued in one country and cashed in another



Disadvantages

Can be harder to track than a personal check
Buying and cashing the money order can incur a fee
Funds could be delayed, depending on where it's cashed
Can be fraudulent





  Advantages Explained  

Doesn't include sensitive information: In some situations, paying with a money order can be safer than paying with a personal check. That's because personal checks include the account holder's routing number and bank account number printed on the bottom—information can be stolen and used to create and sign fraudulent checks. In contrast, money orders don't include personal information about the purchaser.
Recipient can cash it at their local bank or credit union: The person who receives a money order doesn't necessarily have to go to the same place that sold the money order or the sender's bank. They can cashed it at their local bank or credit union, though this could mean they have to wait to get the cash.
Can be deposited into a bank account for free: A recipient can deposit a money order into a bank account, much as you would do a check. Depositing money orders is a good option for recipients concerned about the fees charged to cash the certificates at other locations.
Can be issued in one country and cashed in another: Money orders can and often are used to send money outside the country. An issuer with multiple branches in different countries can issue a money order in one country that can be cashed in another country. International money orders thus provide an inexpensive and swift way to send money across the border.


  Disadvantages Explained  

Can be harder to track than a personal check: To track a money order, the sender must fill out tracking forms and pay an additional fee to learn whether the money order has been cashed. The entire process for researching the status of a money order can take weeks. However, the U.S. Postal Service, also known as USPS, offers an online money order inquiry service that allows buyers to input a money order number and get an update on its status.
Buying and cashing the money order can incur a fee: When you buy a money order you may need to pay a small fee, and the same goes for cashing one if you cash it somewhere else besides your own bank or credit union. Depositing it into a bank account or cashing it at the issuer's office are good options for bypassing fees for cashing a money order.
Funds could be delayed, depending on where it's cashed: Just note that if you cash a money order at your local financial institution and it's not a branch of the issuer, you might not be able to get all of the money right away. It depends on your bank's funds availability policy.
Can be fraudulent: Some unscrupulous people create fake money orders. Be wary about receiving one from someone you don't know, and don't spend the cash from money orders you deposit in the bank until you know the bank was able to cash them.


   How to Buy a Money Order  

You can buy a money order at any bank or credit union, as well as most grocery stores, convenience stores, and any store that offers check cashing or money services such as MoneyGram or Western Union. The U.S. Postal Service also offers money orders.



To order one, you simply need to bring enough money to pay for the money order, either in cash or with a debit card.






For transactions above $3,000, you may be asked to present your ID and fill out a special form. This information is used to prevent money laundering.


   How Much Do Money Orders Cost?  

Although there is an additional cost for issuing a money order, the fee is generally only a small fraction of the value of the order. For example, the U.S. Postal Service charges $1.75 for money orders of up to $500, and $2.40 for orders from $500.01 up to $1,000. Fees are lower for money orders issued in military postal facilities.



Money orders from commercial institutions may have different prices, but the fees will tend to be similar. However, international money orders may incur higher fees.


   Money Orders vs. Cashier's Checks  

A cashier's check is similar to a money order, in that both are sometimes used for payment in situations where cash or a personal check would be impractical. Neither can be bought with credit—you have to use cash.



But unlike a money order, a cashier's check is simply a check written by a financial institution against its own assets. This is considered more reliable than a personal check because there is no chance of the check bouncing.



For this reason, cashier's checks are frequently used to make large purchases, such as for a house or vehicle. Whereas banks might place a hold on a personal check for that much money, funds issued by a cashier's check should be available the next business day.



In contrast, money orders are typically used for smaller transfers, such as for rent or mortgage payments. Many institutions, such as the U.S. Postal Service, cap money orders at $1,000.


   Alternatives to Money Orders  

In addition to checks and money orders, other ways to send guaranteed funds to an individual or business include traveler’s checks, wire transfers, bank drafts, and cashier's checks. But money orders are frequently used for payment in situations where the party being paid isn't set up to receive cash.



In some cases, a personal check, debit card, credit card, or even online payment apps might also be acceptable for payment. However, money orders are slightly different from these alternatives. Unlike card or electronic payments, the recipient of a money order doesn't need any special technology to accept a money order. And, unlike checks, a money order can't bounce.




How Do You Fill Out a Money Order?
When you buy a money order, you will need to include information about the purchaser (you) and the recipient. Write the name of the intended recipient in the "Pay to the Order" field, and your full legal name and address in the appropriate fields. Fill in the amount to be transferred. Some money orders may not ask for your address. Finally, sign and date the money order, and keep the receipt.




Where Can I Cash a Money Order?
You can cash a money order in the same places that issue money orders, such as a bank, credit union, post office, check-cashing store, or even some convenience and grocery stores. You will need to endorse, or sign, the order and verify your identity. There may be a small fee for cashing the money order, which you can skip by depositing the money order into a bank account.




How Long Is a Money Order Good For?
Money orders don't expire, but depending on the state and issuer, they may incur additional service charges if you cash them more than a year after they were issued. These terms will be described on the back of your money order. However, domestic money orders from the U.S. Postal Service will never expire or lose value.


   The Bottom Line  

A money order allows the recipient to receive immediate cash payment from a bank or other financial institution. For that reason, money orders are a popular way to make small to medium-size payments in circumstances where cash or personal checks aren't practical. Unlike cash, lost money orders can be replaced (with a receipt presented), and they can't bounce due to insufficient funds.
A money purchase plan is an employee retirement benefit plan that resembles a corporate profit-sharing program. An employer deposits a percentage of a participating employee's salary in the account every year, but the employee is not permitted to contribute to the fund. However, they can choose how to invest the money based on options offered by the employer.





Key Takeaways

The money purchase plan is an annual employer contribution to its employees' retirement savings.Employees don't contribute to this plan but may opt to have additional retirement savings plans.A money purchase plan is a qualified retirement savings plan where the employee does not pay taxes on the money until it is distributed.


   Understanding the Money Purchase Plan  

A money purchase plan is a qualified retirement plan, eligible for tax benefits and subject to tax regulations. The rules are similar to those for other qualified retirement accounts:



If you leave your employer, you can roll the money over into a 401(k) or an IRA
You can't withdraw the funds before retirement without incurring a penalty
Your employer may authorize loans but not withdrawals from the account



The money purchase plan is designed to provide retirement income. Upon retirement, the total pool of capital in the account can be used to purchase a lifetime annuity or withdrawn in a lump sum.






A money purchase plan may be used in addition to an employee's retirement savings, such as a 401(k).


   Contributions to a Money Purchase Plan  

The amount in each member's account differs, depending on the employer's level of contributions and the investment return earned on those contributions. Money purchase plans can be used in addition to profit-sharing plans or along with other retirement plans. In a money purchase plan, the employee's account balance is tax-deferred until the money is withdrawn, while the employer's contribution is tax-deductible.



It is similar to a profit-sharing plan, but the company cannot adjust its contribution level to a money purchase plan as profits go up or down. Company contributions must be made whether or not the business makes a profit, or how much profit it makes. For 2023, the overall contribution limits allowed by the IRS are the lesser of 25% of compensation or $66,000. 



The participant's benefit at retirement is based on total contributions and the gains or losses on investments. As long as the contribution amounts remain within the annual limits, the money is tax-deferred. Employers typically establish a vesting period after which an employee is eligible for the program. After being fully vested, an employee may start taking out funds at age 59½ without a tax penalty.





Required Minimum Distribution

Like all defined contribution plans, RMDs are required for a money purchase plan. For 2023, the required minimum distribution age is 73 and will increase to 75 in 2033.


   Advantages and Disadvantages  

The money purchase plan can substantially boost retirement savings if used with other savings plans like a 401(k). For the company, having such a program gives them an edge in competing for talent as the tax benefit levels the expenditure. On the downside, the money purchase plan may have higher administrative costs than other retirement plans.




Is a Money Purchase Plan a Defined Contribution Plan?
A money purchase plan is a defined contribution plan where employer contributions are based on a fixed percentage of an employee's annual compensation or salary.




Can You Withdraw Money From a Money Purchase Plan?
Like other retirement plans, withdrawals before age 59-1/2 will incur a penalty. After retirement age, money can be distributed as a lump sum or as an annuity.




Is a Money Purchase Plan an Employer Sponsored Retirement Plan?
A money purchase plan is considered an employer-sponsored retirement plan that requires companies to contribute a specific percentage of an employee's salary each year, regardless of the company's profitability.


   The Bottom Line  

A money purchase plan is an employee retirement benefit plan that resembles a corporate profit-sharing program where the employer deposits a percentage of a participating employee's salary in the account every year. Like most retirement plans, the money purchase plan requires that employees refrain from distributions before age 59-1/2. The plan also has a provision for required minimum distributions.
What Is the Money Supply?  

The money supply is the sum total of all of the currency and other liquid assets in a country's economy on the date measured. The money supply includes all cash in circulation and all bank deposits that the account holder can easily convert to cash.



Governments issue paper currency and coins through their central banks or treasuries, or a combination of both. In order to keep the economy stable, banking regulators increase or reduce the available money supply through policy changes and regulatory decisions.





Key Takeaways


The money supply is the total amount of cash and cash equivalents such as savings accounts that is circulating in an economy at a given point in time.
Variations of the money supply number take into account non-cash items like credit and loans.
In the U.S., the Federal Reserve tracks the money supply from month to month.
The Fed also influences the money supply, through actions that increase or decrease the amount of cash in the system.
Monetarists, who view the money supply as the main driver of demand in an economy, believe that increasing the money supply leads to inflation.

Tracking the Money Supply

The Federal Reserve website has a running account of the U.S. money supply month by month going back to 1999. (The Fed refers to the money supply as the money stock.)


   Understanding Money Supply  

In the United States, the Federal Reserve, known as the Fed, is the policy-making body that regulates the money supply.



Its economists track the money supply over time in order to determine whether too much money is flowing, which can lead to inflation, or too little money is flowing, which can cause deflation.



The Fed has a couple of weapons to use in order to keep the economy growing at a reasonable level.



It controls interest rates by setting the key rates that it charges to the nation's banks for the overnight loans of government money that keep the banking system running. The rates for all other loans are derived from those federal lending rates.It adds or removes cash from the system by changing the amount of money that flows to banks for use in loans to businesses and consumers.



The money supply is tracked over time as a key factor in analyzing the health of the economy, pinpointing its weak spots, and developing policies to correct the weaknesses.



In its public releases, the Fed generally refers to the money supply as the money stock.





$19.93 trillion

As of February 2023, the seasonally-adjusted M1 money supply was 19.34 trillion, according to the Federal Reserve.


   Effect of Money Supply on the Economy  

An increase in the supply of money typically lowers interest rates, which in turn, generates more investment and puts more money in the hands of consumers, thereby stimulating spending. Businesses respond by ordering more raw materials and increasing production. The increased business activity raises the demand for labor.



The opposite can occur if the money supply falls or when its growth rate declines. Banks lend less, businesses put off new projects, and consumer demand for home mortgages and car loans declines.



Change in the money supply has long been considered to be a key factor in driving economic performance and business cycles. Macroeconomic schools of thought that focus heavily on the role of money supply include Irving Fisher's Quantity Theory of Money, Monetarism, and Austrian Business Cycle Theory.



Historically, measuring the money supply has shown that there are relationships between money supply and inflation and between money supply and price levels.



However, since 2000, these relationships have become less predictable, reducing their reliability as a guide for monetary policy. Although money supply measures are still widely used, they are among a number of economic measures that economists and the Federal Reserve collect, track, and review.


   The Money Supply Numbers: M1, M2 and Beyond  

The Federal Reserve tracks two distinct numbers on the nation's money supply and labels them M1 and M2. Each category includes or excludes specific kinds of money. There is yet another number, the M3, but its reporting was discontinued by the Fed in 2006.



There's also an MO and an MB, but these are generally included in the main categories rather than being reportedly separately.



All of the categories are an accounting of the amount of cash in the economy, but each category has a slightly different definition of "cash," or liquid assets.






  The M1  

M1, also called narrow money, is often synonymous with "money supply" in reports from the financial media. This is a count of all of the notes and coins that are in circulation, whether they're in someone's wallet or in a bank teller's drawer, plus other money equivalents that can be converted easily to cash. A regular bank savings account, for example, is a money equivalent. The account holder can convert those savings to cash at any time and instantly.






  The M2  

M2 includes M1 plus short-term time deposits in banks and money market funds.



Generally, less than a year is considered short-term.


  The M3, the MO, and the MB  

The M3, the MO, and the MB are not separately represented in the Federal Reserve reports on money supply.



M3, now discontinued, included M2 plus long-term deposits. The Federal Reserve decided that it added no real information of importance to the numbers and was no longer useful in its analysis.MO measures real cash in circulation and in bank reserves. MB, or money base, is the total supply of currency pus the stored portion of commercial bank reserves at the central bank. Both MO and MB are incorporated in M1 and M2.



The Federal Reserve releases the latest numbers on M1 and M2 money supplies on a weekly and monthly basis. The numbers are reported widely by the financial media and are published on the Fed's website.


   What Are the Determinants of the Money Supply?  

The big numbers of M1 or M2 contain a number of components that are analyzed by economists to determine just how all of that money is flowing through the system and where there might be problems. Economists speak of these components as the determinants of the money supply. They include:



The currency deposit ratio. That is, the amount of cash that the public at large is keeping on hand rather than depositing in banks.
The reserve ratio. This is the amount of cash that the Federal Reserve requires a bank to keep in its vaults to satisfy all potential withdrawals by its customers, even in the event of a run on the banks.
The excess reserve. This is the amount of money that the banks have available to lend out to businesses and individuals.




What Happens When the Federal Reserve Limits the Money Supply?
A country’s money supply has a significant effect on its macroeconomic profile, particularly in relation to interest rates, inflation, and the business cycle. In America, the Federal Reserve is responsible for the monetary supply. When the Fed limits the money supply via contractionary or "hawkish" monetary policy, interest rates rise and the cost of borrowing goes higher.There is a delicate balance to these decisions. Limiting the money supply can slow down inflation, as the Fed intends. But there is also the risk that it will slow economic growth too much, leading to more unemployment.




How Is the Money Supply Determined?
A central bank regulates the amount of available in a country. Through monetary policy, a central bank can undertake an expansionary or contractionary policy.An expansionary policy aims to increase the money supply. For example, the central bank might engage in open market operations. That means it will purchase short-term U.S. Treasury bills using newly-minted money. That money thus enters into circulation.A contractionary policy would require selling Treasuries. That removes some of the money circulating in the economy. 




What's the Difference Between M0, M1, and M2?
The U.S. money supply is reported in two main categories, M1 and M2. MO is included in both M1 and M2.MO is the total amount of paper money and coins in circulation, plus the current amount of central bank reserves.M1 is the most frequently reported headline number. It is MO plus money held in regular savings accounts and in travelers' checks.M2 is all of M1 plus money invested in short-term assets that mature in less than a year, like some certificates of deposit. 




Why Does the Money Supply Expand or Contract?
Consider a Main Street bank as a microcosm of the economy as a whole. Local people are prospering lately, so they have more money to save. They deposit it in the bank. The bank keeps part of the deposits in a vault but lends most of it out to other individuals and businesses. The loans are repaid with interest, and the bank has more money to loan. Times are good, and the money supply is increasing.But what happens when times are not so good? Bank deposits fall because people are just getting by or, worse, losing their jobs. The bank has less money to lend. In any case, businesses and individuals shy away from big spending due to the poor economy. The money supply decreases.


   The Bottom Line  

The money supply may be one of the most tangible and understandable subjects in economics. It's a count of every bit of cash floating around the entire U.S. economy. Every dollar and every coin, down to the small change that people have in their pockets.



Analyzing the number is harder. Economists want to know precisely where that money is and how is it being used. Is it being hoarded or splurged? Invested or spent on day-to-day necessities?



The Federal Reserve considers the money supply in terms of potential action. Should it pump more money into the economy to encourage freer spending, investment, and job creation? Or should it pull back, slowing the flow of money through the system to avoid inflation?



The Federal Reserve releases its numbers on the money supply on the fourth Tuesday of every month, usually at 1 p.m. Eastern time.
What Is the Money-Weighted Rate of Return?  

The money-weighted rate of return (MWRR) is a measure of the performance of an investment. The MWRR is calculated by finding the rate of return that will set the present values (PV) of all cash flows equal to the value of the initial investment.



The MWRR is equivalent to the internal rate of return (IRR). MWRR can be compared with the time-weighted return (TWR), which removes the effects of cash in- and outflows.





Key Takeaways

The money-weighted rate of return (MWRR) calculates the performance of an investment that accounts for the size and timing of deposits or withdrawals.The MWRR is calculated by finding the rate of return that will set the present values of all cash flows equal to the value of the initial investment.The MWRR is equivalent to the internal rate of return (IRR).The MWRR sets the initial value of an investment to equal future cash flows, such as dividends added, withdrawals, deposits, and sale proceeds.


   Understanding the Money-Weighted Rate of Return  

There are many ways to measure asset returns, so it is important to know which method is used when reviewing asset performance. The MWRR incorporates the size and timing of cash flows, so it effectively measures portfolio returns.
The MWRR sets the initial value of an investment to equal future cash flows, such as dividends added, withdrawals, deposits, and sale proceeds. In other words, the MWRR helps to determine the rate of return needed to start with the initial investment amount, factoring all of the changes to cash flows during the investment period, including the sale proceeds.

Using a Spreadsheet
Because the formula for MWRR is complex and requires guesswork and trial and error, you'd want to use a spreadsheet or calculator to help you estimate returns. So, we'll use a spreadsheet to explain how to calculate it.
Let’s say you buy one share of a stock for $50 that pays an annual $2 dividend and sell it after three years for $65. You received two dividends before selling the stock.
The initial outlay of $50 in year one is negative because it is money you've spent. Each year after the purchase, you gain $2 until you sell it for $65 in year three after receiving the dividend. The IRR function used in most spreadsheet applications will calculate the MWRR for you as shown in the following table.

The IRR function in the spreadsheet asks for values and a rate guess, which is optional:



= IRR ( cashflow values, rate guess )



To use the function, highlight the cells that contain your cashflow values so that the column and cell numbers are entered into the field between the parenthesis, skip the rate guess, and press enter.


   Cash Flows and the Money-Weighted Rate of Return  

As stated above, the MWRR for an investment is identical in concept to the IRR. In other words, it is the discount rate on which the net present value (NPV) = 0, or the present value of inflows = the present value of outflows.



With that in mind, it’s critical to know how to identify the cash flows in and out of a portfolio, including the sale of the asset or investment. Some of the cash flows that an investor might have in a portfolio include:


  Outflows  

The cost of any investment purchasedReinvested dividends or interestWithdrawals


  Inflows  

The proceeds from any investment soldDividends or interest receivedContributions


   The Difference Between Money-Weighted Rate of Return and Time-Weighted Rate of Return  

The MWRR is often compared to the time-weighted rate of return (TWRR), but the two calculations have distinct differences. The TWRR is a measure of the compound rate of growth in a portfolio. The TWRR measure is often used to compare the returns of investment managers because it eliminates the distorting effects on growth rates created by inflows and outflows of money.



It can be difficult to determine how much money was earned on a portfolio because deposits and withdrawals distort the value of the return on the portfolio. Investors can’t simply subtract the beginning balance, after the initial deposit, from the ending balance since the ending balance reflects both the rate of return on the investments and any deposits or withdrawals during the time invested in the fund.



The TWRR breaks up the return on an investment portfolio into separate intervals based on whether money was added to or withdrawn from the fund. The MWRR differs in that it takes into account investor behavior via the impact of fund inflows and outflows on performance but doesn’t separate the intervals where cash flows occurred, as the TWRR does. Therefore, cash outflows or inflows can impact the MWRR. If there are no cash flows, then both methods should deliver the same or similar results.


   Limitations of Using Money-Weighted Rate of Return  

The MWRR considers all the cash flows from the fund or contribution, including withdrawals. Should an investment extend over several quarters, for example, the MWRR lends more weight to the fund's performance when it is at its largest—hence, the description “money-weighted.”



The weighting can penalize fund managers because of cash flows over which they have no control. In other words, if an investor adds a large sum of money to a portfolio just before its performance rises, it equates to positive action. This is because the larger portfolio benefits more (in dollar terms) from the portfolio's growth than if the contribution had not been made.



On the other hand, if an investor withdraws funds from a portfolio just before a performance surge, it equates to a negative action. The now-smaller fund sees less benefit (in dollar terms) from the portfolio growth than if the withdrawal had not occurred.




What Are the Advantages of MWRR?
The MWRR allows you to view whether your investment generates a consistent return with an interest rate. If your rate is not consistent, your rate of return begins falling.




Should I Use Money Weighted or Time Weighted?
The MWRR allows you to see how your changes affect your investment, eliminating its usefulness as a comparison tool but letting you see how your decisions affected it. TWRR lets you see how your investment performs without your changes, which lets you compare it to similar investments. Which you use depends on what you want to view.




What Is Better, Time Weighted or Money Weighted?
While each indicates how your investment has performed, they demonstrate performance accounting for different investing actions. So neither is better or worse; they can be used together or separately to determine how an investment is performing.


   The Bottom Line  

The money-weighted rate of return is an investment performance measurement. It lets you see how it has performed while accounting for your investing activities, like adding more capital through contributions or reinvesting dividends.
What Is a Monopolist?  

A monopolist is an individual, group, or company that controls all of the market for a particular good or service. A monopolist probably also believes in policies that favor monopolies since it gives them greater power. A monopolist has little incentive to improve their product because customers have no alternatives. Instead, their motivation is focused on protecting the monopoly.





Key Takeaways

A monopolist refers to an individual, group, or company that dominates and controls the market for a specific good or service.This lack of competition and lack of substitute goods or services means the monopolist wields enough power in the marketplace to charge high prices.While being the sole or dominant player in a sector is not illegal in itself, it can attract government sanctions if the monopolist's behavior begins to drastically limit the free market.The United States government regulates unfair competition by enforcing antitrust laws, which restrict monopolies and protect consumers from predatory business practices.Some monopolies are legal and sanctioned by the government, such as companies in the utilities sector.


   Understanding Monopolists  

Monopolies exist when a monopolist becomes the only supplier of a particular product or service. This is different from a monopsony, which refers to a single entity's sole power to purchase a good or service. It is also different from an oligopoly, which consists of a few sellers dominating a market. 



The hallmark of a monopoly is a lack of economic competition to produce the good or service, a lack of viable substitute goods, and the possibility of a high monopoly price well above the seller's marginal cost that leads to excessive profit.  



In economics, a monopoly is a single seller. However, according to the law, a monopoly only needs to be a business entity that has significant market power—enough power to charge overly high prices. Although monopolies may be big businesses, size is not a required characteristic of a monopoly.



A small business may still have the power to raise prices in a small industry. Monopolies can be established by a government, form organically, or form by the merger of formerly independent companies or organizations.


   Criticism of Monopolists  

In many jurisdictions, such as the United States, there are laws restricting monopolies. Being the sole or dominant player in a market is often not illegal in itself. However, certain categories of monopolistic behavior can be considered abusive in a free market, and such activities will often attract the monopoly label and legal sanctions to go with it.



When a company is the sole provider of a good or service, it can become powerful enough to prevent other companies from entering the marketplace and providing competition. With the lack of alternative choices in the marketplace, consumers are often left with no choice but to pay the higher prices the monopolist demands or go without the desired product or service.



Governments enact and enforce antitrust laws to penalize monopolists and ensure fair competition in the marketplace. These laws protect consumers from predatory business practices, such as price gouging. In some cases, the government may step in and force a breakup of the monopoly.


   Government-Granted Monopoly  

A government-granted monopoly or legal monopoly, by contrast, is sanctioned by the state, often to provide an incentive to invest in a risky venture or enrich a domestic interest group. Patents, copyrights, and trademarks are sometimes used as examples of government-granted monopolies. In the United States, many companies in the utilities sector are an example of government-granted monopolies. A government may also reserve a venture for itself and form a government monopoly.


   Characteristics of a True Monopolist  

A monopolist has full control of a market and is the one supplier that provides a good or service to many consumers. Beyond that, however, there are certain characteristics of a monopolist that stand out above others:



The primary concern of a monopolist is to maximize profits at all costs.
A monopolist will have the power to arbitrarily decide the price of the goods or products to be sold. Usually, this decision is made in such a way that keeps prices as high as possible while satisfying consumer demand.
The monopolist may go to extreme measures to ensure other sellers are unable to go into business within the territory.
Because of the lack of competition, the monopolist may be slow to make product improvements or respond to consumer complaints.
What Is Monopolistic Competition?  

Monopolistic competition exists when many companies offer competing products or services that are similar, but not perfect, substitutes.



The barriers to entry in a monopolistic competitive industry are low, and the decisions of any one firm do not directly affect its competitors. The competing companies differentiate themselves based on pricing and marketing decisions.





Key Takeaways

Monopolistic competition occurs when many companies offer products that are similar but not identical.Firms in monopolistic competition differentiate their products through pricing and marketing strategies.Barriers to entry, or the costs or other obstacles that prevent new competitors from entering an industry, are low in monopolistic competition.












Investopedia / Joules Garcia


   Understanding Monopolistic Competition  

Monopolistic competition exists between a monopoly and perfect competition, combines elements of each, and includes companies with similar, but not identical, product offerings.



Restaurants, hair salons, household items, and clothing are examples of industries with monopolistic competition. Items like dish soap or hamburgers are sold, marketed, and priced by many competing companies.



Demand is highly elastic for goods and services of the competing companies and pricing is often a key strategy for these competitors. One company may opt to lower prices and sacrifice a higher profit margin, hoping for higher sales. Another may raise its price and use packaging or marketing that suggests better quality or sophistication.



Companies often use distinct marketing strategies and branding to distinguish their products. Because the products all serve the same purpose, the average consumer often does not know the precise differences between the various products, or how to determine what a fair price may be.


   Characteristics of Monopolistic Competition  
  Low Barriers to Entry  

In monopolistic competition, one firm does not monopolize the market and multiple companies can enter the market and all can compete for a market share. Companies do not need to consider how their decisions influence competitors so each firm can operate without fear of raising competition.


  Product Differentiation  

Competing companies differentiate their similar products with distinct marketing strategies, brand names, and different quality levels. 


  Pricing  

Companies in monopolistic competition act as price makers and set prices for goods and services. Firms in monopolistic competition can raise or lower prices without inciting a price war, often found in oligopolies.


  Demand Elasticity  

Demand is highly elastic in monopolistic competition and very responsive to price changes. Consumers will change from one brand name to another for items like laundry detergent based solely on price increases.


   Advantages and Disadvantages of Monopolistic Competition  

Monopolistic competition provides both benefits and pitfalls for companies and consumers.





Pros

Few barriers to entry for new companies
Variety of choices for consumers
Company decision-making power for prices and marketing 
Consistent quality of product for consumers



Cons

Many competitors limits access to economies of scale
Inefficient company spending on marketing, packaging and advertising
Too many choices for consumers means extra research for consumers
Misleading advertising or imperfect information for consumers







What Is the Difference Between Monopolistic Competition and Perfect Competition?
In perfect competition, the product offered by competitors is the same item. If one competitor increases its price, it will lose all of its market share to the other companies based on market supply and demand forces, where prices are not set by companies and sellers accept the pricing determined by market activity.In monopolistic competition, supply and demand forces do not dictate pricing. Firms are selling similar, yet distinct products, so firms determine the pricing. Product differentiation is the key feature of monopolistic competition, where products are marketed by quality or brand. Demand is highly elastic, and any change in pricing can cause demand to shift from one competitor to another.




How Does Monopolistic Competition Function in the Short Term and Long Term?
Companies aim to produce a quantity where marginal revenue equals marginal cost to maximize profit or minimize losses. When existing firms are making a profit, new firms will enter the market. The demand curve and the marginal revenue curve shift and new firms stop entering when all firms are making zero profit in the long run. If existing firms are incurring a loss, some firms will exit the market. The firms stop exiting the market until all firms start making zero profit. The market is at equilibrium in the long run only when there is no further exit or entry in the market or when all firms make zero profit in the long run.




What Industry Is an Example of Monopolistic Competition?
Monopolistic competition is present in restaurants like Burger King and McDonald's. Both are fast food chains that target a similar market and offer similar products and services. These two companies are actively competing with one another, and seek to differentiate themselves through brand recognition, price, and by offering different food and drink packages.




What Is the Difference Between Monopolistic Competition and a Monopoly?
A monopoly is when a single company dominates an industry and can set prices for its product without fear of competition. Monopolies limit consumer choices and control production quantity and quality. Monopolistic competitive companies must compete with others, restricting their ability to substantially raise prices without affecting demand and providing a range of product choices for consumers. Monopolistic competition is more common than monopolies, which are discouraged in free-market nations.


   The Bottom Line  

Monopolistic competition exists when many companies offer competitive products or services that are similar, but not exact, substitutes. Hair salons and clothing are examples of industries with monopolistic competition. Pricing and marketing are key strategies for competing companies and often rely on branding or discount pricing strategies to increase market share.
What Is a Monopolistic Market?  

A monopolistic market is a theoretical condition that describes a market where only one company may offer products and services to the public. A monopolistic market is the opposite of a perfectly competitive market, in which an infinite number of firms operate. In a purely monopolistic model, the monopoly firm can restrict output, raise prices, and enjoy super-normal profits in the long run.





Key Takeaways

A monopoly describes a market situation where one company owns all the market share and can control prices and output.A pure monopoly rarely occurs, but there are instances where companies own a large portion of the market share, and ant-trust laws apply.Altria, the tobacco manufacturer, has monopolistic-type control over the tobacco market.


   Understanding Monopolistic Markets  

A monopolistic market is a market structure with the characteristics of a pure monopoly. A monopoly exists when one supplier provides a particular good or service to many consumers. In a monopolistic market, the monopoly, or the controlling company, has full control of the market, so it sets the price and supply of a good or service.



Purely monopolistic markets are scarce and perhaps even impossible in the absence of absolute barriers to entry, such as a ban on competition or sole possession of all-natural resources.



When they do occur, the monopoly that sets the price and supply of a good or service is called the price maker. A monopoly is a profit maximizer because by changing the supply and price of the good or service it provides it can generate greater profits. By determining the point at which its marginal revenue equals its marginal cost, the monopoly can find the level of output that maximizes its profit.



With generally only one seller controlling the production and distribution of a good or service, other firms cannot enter the market. There are typically high barriers to entry, which are obstacles that prevent a company from entering into a market. Potential entrants to the market are at a disadvantage because the monopoly has the first-mover advantage and can lower prices to undercut a potential newcomer and prevent them from gaining market share.



Since there is only one supplier, and firms cannot easily enter or exit, there are no substitutes for the goods or services. Therefore, a monopoly also has absolute product differentiation because there are no other comparable goods or services.


   The History of Monopolies  

The term “monopoly” originated in English law to describe a royal grant. Such a grant authorized one merchant or company to trade in a particular good while no other merchant or company could do so.



Historically, monopolistic markets arose when single producers received exclusive legal privileges from the government, such as the arrangement reached between the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and AT&T between 1913 and 1984. During this period, no other telecommunications company was allowed to compete with AT&T because the government erroneously believed the market could only support one producer.



More recently, short-run private companies may engage in monopoly-like behavior when production has relatively high fixed costs, which causes long-run average total costs to decrease as output increases. The effect of this behavior could temporarily allow a single producer to operate on a lower cost curve than any other producer.


   Effects of Monopolistic Markets  

The typical political and cultural objection to monopolistic markets is that a monopoly, in the absence of other suppliers of the same product or service, could charge a premium to their customers. Consumers have no substitutes and are forced to pay the price for the goods dictated by the monopolist. In many respects, this is an objection against high prices, not necessarily monopolistic behavior.



The standard economic argument against monopolies is different. According to neoclassical analysis, a monopolistic market is undesirable because it restricts output, not because of monopolist benefits by raising prices. Restricted output equates to less production, which reduces total real social income.



Even if monopolistic powers exist, such as the U.S. Postal Service’s legal monopoly on delivering first-class mail, consumers often have many alternatives such as using standard mail through FedEx or UPS or email. For this reason, it is uncommon for monopolistic markets to successfully restrict output or enjoy super-normal profits in the long run.


   Regulation of a Monopolistic Market  

As with the model of perfect competition, the model for a monopolistic competition is difficult or impossible to replicate in the real economy. True monopolies are typically the product of regulations against the competition. It is common, for instance, for cities or towns to grant local monopolies to utility and telecommunications companies.



Nevertheless, governments often regulate private business behavior that appears monopolistic, such as a situation where one firm owns the lion's share of a market. The FCC, World Trade Organization, and the European Union each have rules for managing monopolistic markets. These are often called antitrust laws.
What Is a Monopoly?  

A monopoly is a market structure where a single seller or producer assumes a dominant position in an industry or a sector. Monopolies are discouraged in free-market economies as they stifle competition and limit substitutes for consumers.



In the United States, antitrust legislation is in place to restrict monopolies, ensuring that one business cannot control a market and use that control to exploit its customers.





Key Takeaways

A monopoly is a market structure that consists of only one seller or producer.A monopoly limits available substitutes for its product and creates barriers for competitors to enter the marketplace.Monopolies can lead to unfair consumer practices.Some monopolies such as those in the utility sector are government regulated.

   Understanding a Monopoly  

A monopoly is a business that is characterized by a lack of competition within a market and unavailable substitutes for its product. Monopolies can dictate price changes and create barriers for competitors to enter the marketplace.



Companies become monopolies by controlling the entire supply chain, from production to sales through vertical integration, or buying competing companies in the market through horizontal integration, becoming the sole producer.



Monopolies typically reap the benefit of economies of scale, the ability to produce mass quantities at lower costs per unit. 


   Types of Monopolies  
  The Pure Monopoly  

A pure monopoly is a single seller in a market or sector with high barriers to entry such as significant startup costs whose product has no substitutes.



Microsoft Corporation was the first company to hold a pure monopoly position on personal computer operating systems. As of 2022, its desktop Windows software still held a market share of 75%.


  Monopolistic Competition  

Multiple sellers in an industry sector with similar substitutes are defined as having monopolistic competition. Barriers to entry are low, and the competing companies differentiate themselves through pricing and marketing efforts.



Their offerings are not perfect substitutes, such as Visa and MasterCard. Other examples of monopolistic competition include retail stores, restaurants, and hair salons.


  The Natural Monopoly  

A natural monopoly develops in reliance on unique raw materials, technology, or specialization. Companies that have patents or extensive research and development costs such as pharmaceutical companies are considered natural monopolies.


  Public Monopolies  

Public monopolies provide essential services and goods, such as the utility industry as only one company commonly supplies energy or water to a region. The monopoly is allowed and heavily regulated by government municipalities and rates and rate increases are controlled.


   Pros and Cons of a Monopoly  

Without competition, monopolies can set prices and keep pricing consistent and reliable for consumers. Monopolies enjoy economies of scale, often able to produce mass quantities at lower costs per unit. Standing alone as a monopoly allows a company to securely invest in innovation without fear of competition.



Conversely, a company that dominates a sector or industry can use its advantage to create artificial scarcities, fix prices, and provide low-quality products. Consumers must trust that a monopoly operates ethically due to limited or unavailable substitutes in the market.


   Regulation of a Monopoly  

Antitrust laws and regulations are in place to discourage monopolistic operations, protect consumers, and ensure an open market.



In 1890, the Sherman Antitrust Act was passed by the U.S. Congress to limit "trusts," a precursor to the monopoly, or groups of companies that colluded to fix prices. This act dismantled monopolies including Standard Oil Company and the American Tobacco Company.



The Clayton Antitrust Act of 1914 created rules for mergers, corporate directors, and listed practices that would violate the Sherman Antitrust Act, and the Federal Trade Commission Act created the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), which, along with the Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of Justice, sets standards for business practices and enforces the two antitrust acts.



The most consequential monopoly breakup in U.S. history was that of AT&T. After controlling the nation's telephone service for decades as a government-supported monopoly, AT&T fell to antitrust laws. In 1982, AT&T, which had telephone lines that reached nearly every home and business in the U.S., was forced to divest itself of 22 local exchange service companies, the main barrier to competition.




What Companies Have Faced Antitrust Violations as a Monopoly?
In 1994, Microsoft was accused of using its significant market share in the personal computer operating systems business to prevent competition and maintain a monopoly. Using Antitrust legislation, Microsoft was accused of "using exclusionary and anticompetitive contracts to market its personal computer operating system software. By these contracts, Microsoft has unlawfully maintained its monopoly of personal computer operating systems and has an unreasonably restrained trade."A federal district judge ruled in 1998 that Microsoft was to be broken into two technology companies, but the decision was later reversed on appeal by a higher court. Microsoft was free to maintain its operating system, application development, and marketing methods.




What Is Price Fixing?
Price fixing is an agreement among competitors to raise, lower, maintain, or stabilize prices or price levels. Antitrust laws require that each company establish prices and other competitive terms on its own, without agreeing with a competitor. Consumers make choices about what products and services to buy and expect that the price has been determined based on supply and demand, not by an agreement among competitors.




How Do Antitrust Laws Protect Consumers?
Antitrust cases can be prosecuted by state or federal governments. Consumers who suspect a company is violating antitrust laws can contact the Antitrust Division or Federal Trade Commission at the federal level. A local company operating within one state can be investigated by the Attorney General of the state.


   The Bottom Line  

A monopoly is defined as a single seller or producer that excludes competition from providing the same product. A monopoly can dictate price changes and creates barriers for competitors to enter the marketplace. Antitrust legislation is in place to restrict monopolies, ensuring that one business cannot control a market and use that control to exploit its customers.
What Is a Monopsony?  

A monopsony is a market condition in which there is only one buyer, the monopsonist. Like a monopoly, a monopsony also has imperfect market conditions. The difference between a monopoly and a monopsony is primarily in the difference between the controlling entities. A single buyer dominates a monopsonized market while an individual seller controls a monopolized market. Monopsonists are common in areas where they supply most or all of the region's jobs.





Key Takeaways

A monopsony refers to a market dominated by a single buyer.In a monopsony, a single buyer generally has a controlling advantage that drives its consumption price levels down.A monopsony can arise due to geographical constraints, government regulation, or unique consumer demands.Monopsonies commonly experience low prices from wholesalers and an advantage in paid wages.Whereas a monopoly results in only one seller of a good that creates upward pricing pressure, a monopsony is a market condition with only one buyer who may be able to cause downward pricing pressure.


   Understanding a Monopsony  

In a monopsony, a large buyer controls the market. Because of their unique position, monopsonies have a wealth of power. For example, being the primary or only supplier of jobs in an area, the monopsony has the power to set wages. In addition, they have bargaining power as they are able to negotiate prices and terms with their suppliers.



Monopsonies take many different forms and may occur in all types of markets. For example, some economists have accused Ernest and Julio Gallo–a conglomerate of wineries and wine producers–of being a monopsony. The company is so large and has so much buying power over grape growers that grape wholesalers have no choice but to lower prices and agree to the company's terms.






Monopsony comes from two Greek words: "monos" meaning "single" and "opsonia" meaning "purchase."


   Characteristics of a Monopsony  

A monopsony is unique to other forms of market situation with distinctive market features. Some of these characteristics are below.


  One Buyer  

In a monopsony, there is only one buyer, which gives them significant market power and control over the price and quantity of goods or services purchased. If more than one buyer is present, it is not a monopsony. For this reason, there's usually natural or built-in limitations to the market that make it unfeasible or impossible for there to be other buyers.


  Low Bargain Power for Sellers  

Due to there being a single buyer that holds a majority of power, monopsonies mean sellers are relatively weak and have reduced bargaining power. This usually results in lower prices and lower quantities sold. Though there may be multiple suppliers or sellers, they usually have collective less ability to control the market compared to what the buyer can impose.


  Market Inefficiencies  

Market inefficiencies arise when the single consumer buys less of the good or service than would be produced in a more competitive market. This may force producers to cut wages, store unsold inventory that would have otherwise been consumed in a "normal" market, or reduce prices to unprofitable levels.


  Limited Innovation  

Since the buyer has significant control over the market, there is less incentive for suppliers to invest in innovation or quality improvements. Even if the producers were to innovate or find better ways to produce a good, they may not be rewarded by a competitive market through better margins or higher prices. Therefore, monopsonies are most detrimental to the long-term growth as it tends to stunt innovative thinking.


   How Monopsonies Are Caused  

There are several scenarios where a monopsony can occur. Like a monopoly, a monopsony also does not adhere to standard pricing from balancing supply-side and demand-side factors.


  Physical Isolation  

A monopsony can arise in a market that is geographically isolated or where transportation costs are high. This can limit the number of potential buyers and make it difficult for competitors to enter the market. This may also make it hard for market participants outside of the geographic region to ship goods into a physical area.


  Limited Product Demand  

When there is limited demand for a good or service, there may only be one buyer willing to purchase the product, resulting in a monopsony. Consider agriculture in developing countries. The good produced in these extremely rural areas often can't be shipped around the world. For this reason, this type of agriculture (and its associated shipping restrictions) is often only demanded by local governments or local food processing companies.


  Barriers to Entry  

High barriers to entry, such as regulations or high capital requirements, can make it difficult for new buyers to enter the market and compete with the existing buyer. This may be true in situations where a buyer must be credentialed, hold certain permits, or meet exclusive criteria.


  Market Consolidation  

A monopsony can result from market consolidation where several buyers merge and control a significant share of the market. Consider how the merger of telecommunication giants T-Mobile and Sprint caused changes on the demand side of business. Instead of there being two different buyers, the post-merger market resulted in just one company (but still potentially buying the same amount of goods).


  Government Requirements  

In some cases, government policies or regulations may lead to a monopsony in a particular market. For example, if the government is the only buyer of a particular product, it can create a monopsony. In addition, governments may enter into contracts that restrict who sellers can contract with or the quantities the producer may supply to broad markets.


   Monopsony in the U.S. Labor Market  

Monopsony can also be common in labor markets when a single employer has an advantage over the workforce. When this happens, the wholesalers, in this case, the potential employees, agree to a lower wage because of factors resulting from the buying company’s control. This wage control drives down the cost to the employer and increases profit margins.



The technology engineering market offers one example of wage suppression. With only a few large tech companies in the market requiring engineers, major players have been accused of conspiring on wages to minimize labor costs so that the major tech companies can generate higher profits. This example illustrates a sort of oligopsony in which multiple companies are involved.


   Criticisms of Monopsonies  

Economists and policymakers have increasingly become concerned with the domination of just a handful of highly successful companies controlling an outsized market share in a given industry.



They fear these industry giants will influence pricing power and exert their ability to suppress industry-wide wages. Indeed, according to the Economic Policy Institute, a nonpartisan and nonprofit think tank, the gap between productivity and wage growth has been increasing over the last 50 years with productivity outpacing wages by more than six times.





Monopsony vs. Monopoly

Monopsony and monopoly are two sides of the same coin. While monopsony refers to one buyer in a market of multiple sellers, monopoly refers to one seller in a market of multiple buyers. Monopsony is about demand while monopoly is about supply.



In 2018, economists Alan Krueger and Eric Posner authored A Proposal for Protecting Low‑Income Workers from Monopsony and Collusion for The Hamilton Project, which argued that labor market collusion or monopsonization might contribute to wage stagnation, rising inequality, and declining productivity in the American economy.



They proposed a series of reforms to protect workers and strengthen the labor market. Those reforms include forcing the federal government to provide enhanced scrutiny of mergers for adverse labor market effects, banning non-compete covenants that bind low-wage workers, and prohibiting no-poaching arrangements among establishments that belong to a single franchise company.


   Monopsony vs. Monopoly  

A monopoly is a market situation where there is only one seller or producer of a particular good or service. This gives that seller considerable power to control prices and output. Meanwhile, a monopsony is a market situation where there is only one buyer of a particular good or service. Monopsony power arises when the buyer has the ability to lower the price of a product or service by reducing the quantity they purchase.



The difference between a monopsony and monopoly is the aspect of trade that is being controlled. While a monopoly has exclusive control over the supply of a good or service, a monopsony has exclusive control over the demand for that good or service. A monopoly leads to the producers have excess power, while a monopsony leads to a consumer having excess power.



Both a monopoly and monopsony can lead to market inefficiencies. However, each results in different inefficiencies that arise in different ways. For example, in a monopoly, consumers face higher prices. In a monopsony, workers may be forced to take on lower wages as a result in imposed lower prices.


   Example of a Monopsony  

Take the example of a coal factory in a coal mining town, an oft-cited example of a monopsony. A coal factory sets up shop in an area where there is no civil life or residents. The company attracts workers and a town builds up around the factory where the majority of the employees work.



The factory is the only real employer in town, it can set wages below market prices, and determine how many individuals will be employed at any time. This has a ripple effect on the rest of the community, such as the other types of businesses set up in town, the amount they can charge, and how many people they can hire.



If the coal factory went bust and closed, there would be no jobs, and therefore, no demand for any of the other goods and services sold by the businesses in the town. But because the coal factory is the only real employer, its wages can be unfair and its working conditions poor and unsafe, yet people will still seek to work there.




What Are the 3 Main Characteristics of a Monopsony?
The three primary characteristics of a monopsony are (1) one firm purchasing all of the goods and services in a market, (2) no other buyers in the market, and (3) barriers to entry into the market.




What Is the Advantage of a Monopsony?
The primary advantage of a monopsony goes towards the single buyer in the market, allowing for a controlling advantage that decreases the price levels of the good or service being bought. This reduction in price allows for a reduction in costs that can be passed on elsewhere.




Is Amazon a Monopsony?
Some experts do consider Amazon to be a monopsony as it has become the largest, and sometimes, only buyer in its market of specific goods and services that it then sells on its platform. Because it is the only buyer, primarily because it controls the largest platform to sell certain goods, it can dictate the prices in which it pays for those goods and services it then sells.


   The Bottom Line  

A monopsony is a market condition in which there is only one buyer. Because there is only one buyer for a good or service, the buyer sets the demand, and therefore, controls the price. Monopsonies, like monopolies, are inefficient to a free market, where supply and demand regulate prices to be fair for consumers.
What Is a Monte Carlo Simulation?  

A Monte Carlo simulation is used to model the probability of different outcomes in a process that cannot easily be predicted due to the intervention of random variables. It is a technique used to understand the impact of risk and uncertainty.



A Monte Carlo simulation is used to tackle a range of problems in many fields including investing, business, physics, and engineering.



It is also referred to as a multiple probability simulation.





Key Takeaways

A Monte Carlo simulation is a model used to predict the probability of a variety of outcomes when the potential for random variables is present.Monte Carlo simulations help to explain the impact of risk and uncertainty in prediction and forecasting models.A Monte Carlo simulation requires assigning multiple values to an uncertain variable to achieve multiple results and then averaging the results to obtain an estimate.Monte Carlo simulations assume perfectly efficient markets.

   Understanding the Monte Carlo Simulation  

When faced with significant uncertainty in making a forecast or estimate, some methods replace the uncertain variable with a single average number. The Monte Carlo Simulation instead uses multiple values and then averages the results.



Monte Carlo simulations have a vast array of applications in fields that are plagued by random variables, notably business and investing. They are used to estimate the probability of cost overruns in large projects and the likelihood that an asset price will move in a certain way.



Telecoms use them to assess network performance in various scenarios, which helps them to optimize their networks. Financial analysts use them to assess the risk that an entity will default, and to analyze derivatives such as options. Insurers and oil well drillers also use them to measure risk.



Monte Carlo simulations have many applications outside of business and finance, such as in meteorology, astronomy, and particle physics.


   Monte Carlo Simulation History  

The Monte Carlo simulation was named after the gambling destination in Monaco because chance and random outcomes are central to this modeling technique, as they are to games like roulette, dice, and slot machines.



The technique was initially developed by Stanislaw Ulam, a mathematician who worked on the Manhattan Project, the secret effort to create the first atomic weapon. He shared his idea with John Von Neumann, a colleague at the Manhattan Project, and the two collaborated to refine the Monte Carlo simulation.


   How Does the Monte Carlo Simulation Method Work?  

The Monte Carlo method acknowledges an issue for any simulation technique: the probability of varying outcomes cannot be firmly pinpointed because of random variable interference. Therefore, a Monte Carlo simulation focuses on constantly repeating random samples.



A Monte Carlo simulation takes the variable that has uncertainty and assigns it a random value. The model is then run and a result is provided. This process is repeated again and again while assigning many different values to the variable in question. Once the simulation is complete, the results are averaged to arrive at an estimate.


   Monte Carlo Simulation Steps  

Microsoft Excel or a similar program can be used to create a Monte Carlo simulation that estimates the probable price movements of stocks or other assets.



There are two components to an asset's price movement: drift, which is its constant directional movement, and a random input, which represents market volatility.



By analyzing historical price data, you can determine the drift, standard deviation, variance, and average price movement of a security. These are the building blocks of a Monte Carlo simulation.


  The 4 Steps in a Monte Carlo Simulation  

Step 1: To project one possible price trajectory, use the historical price data of the asset to generate a series of periodic daily returns using the natural logarithm (note that this equation differs from the usual percentage change formula):


















Periodic Daily Return


=


l


n



(



Day’s Price


Previous Day’s Price



)








\begin{aligned} &\text{Periodic Daily Return} = ln \left ( \frac{ \text{Day's Price} }{ \text{Previous Day's Price} } \right ) \\ \end{aligned}


​Periodic Daily Return=ln(Previous Day’s PriceDay’s Price​)​



Step 2: Next use the AVERAGE, STDEV.P, and VAR.P functions on the entire resulting series to obtain the average daily return, standard deviation, and variance inputs, respectively. The drift is equal to:


















Drift


=


Average Daily Return


−



Variance


2

















where:
















Average Daily Return


=


Produced from Excel’s

Variance


=


Produced from Excel’s
















VAR.P function from periodic daily returns series







\begin{aligned} &\text{Drift} = \text{Average Daily Return} - \frac{ \text{Variance} }{ 2 } \\ &\textbf{where:} \\ &\text{Average Daily Return} = \text{Produced from Excel's} \\ &\text{AVERAGE function from periodic daily returns series} \\ &\text{Variance} = \text{Produced from Excel's} \\ &\text{VAR.P function from periodic daily returns series} \\ \end{aligned}


​Drift=Average Daily Return−2Variance​where:Average Daily Return=Produced from Excel’sAVERAGE function from periodic daily returns seriesVariance=Produced from Excel’sVAR.P function from periodic daily returns series​



Alternatively, drift can be set to 0; this choice reflects a certain theoretical orientation, but the difference will not be huge, at least for shorter time frames.



Step 3: Next, obtain a random input:


















Random Value


=


σ


×


NORMSINV(RAND())
















where:
















σ


=


Standard deviation, produced from Excel’s
















STDEV.P function from periodic daily returns series
















NORMSINV and RAND


=


Excel functions







\begin{aligned} &\text{Random Value} = \sigma \times \text{NORMSINV(RAND())} \\ &\textbf{where:} \\ &\sigma = \text{Standard deviation, produced from Excel's} \\ &\text{STDEV.P function from periodic daily returns series} \\ &\text{NORMSINV and RAND} = \text{Excel functions} \\ \end{aligned}


​Random Value=σ×NORMSINV(RAND())where:σ=Standard deviation, produced from Excel’sSTDEV.P function from periodic daily returns seriesNORMSINV and RAND=Excel functions​



The equation for the following day's price is:


















Next Day’s Price


=


Today’s Price


×



e



(


Drift


+


Random Value


)









\begin{aligned} &\text{Next Day's Price} = \text{Today's Price} \times e^{ ( \text{Drift} + \text{Random Value} ) }\\ \end{aligned}


​Next Day’s Price=Today’s Price×e(Drift+Random Value)​



Step 4: To take e to a given power x in Excel, use the EXP function: EXP(x). Repeat this calculation the desired number of times. (Each repetition represents one day.) The result is a simulation of the asset's future price movement.



By generating an arbitrary number of simulations, you can assess the probability that a security's price will follow a given trajectory.


   Monte Carlo Simulation Results Explained  

The frequencies of different outcomes generated by this simulation will form a normal distribution, that is, a bell curve. The most likely return is in the middle of the curve, meaning there is an equal chance that the actual return will be higher or lower.



The probability that the actual return will be within one standard deviation of the most probable ("expected") rate is 68%. The probability that it will be within two standard deviations is 95%, and that it will be within three standard deviations 99.7%. 



Still, there is no guarantee that the most expected outcome will occur, or that actual movements will not exceed the wildest projections.



Crucially, a Monte Carlo simulation ignores everything that is not built into the price movement such as macro trends, a company's leadership, market hype, and cyclical factors).



In other words, it assumes a perfectly efficient market.


   Advantages and Disadvantages of a Monte Carlo Simulation  

The Monte Carlo method is used to help an investor estimate the likelihood of a gain or a loss on a certain investment. Other methods have the same aim.



The Monte Carlo simulation was created to overcome a perceived disadvantage of other methods of estimating a probable outcome.



No simulation can pinpoint an inevitable outcome. The Monte Carlo method aims at a sounder estimate of the probability that an outcome will differ from a projection.



The difference is that the Monte Carlo method tests a number of random variables and then averages them, rather than starting out with an average.



Like any financial simulation, the Monte Carlo method uses historical price data as the basis for a projection of future price data. It then disrupts the pattern by introducing random variables, represented by numbers. Finally, it averages those numbers to arrive at an estimate of the risk that the pattern will be disrupted in real life.




How Is the Monte Carlo Simulation Used in Finance Applications?
The Monte Carlo simulation is used to estimate the probability of a certain income. As such, it is widely used by investors and financial analysts to evaluate the probable success of investments they're considering. Some common uses include:Pricing stock options. The potential price movements of the underlying asset are tracked given every possible variable. The results are averaged and then discounted to the asset's current price. This is intended to indicate the probable payoff of the options.Portfolio valuation. A number of alternative portfolios can be tested using the Monte Carlo simulation in order to arrive at a measure of their comparative risk.Fixed income investments. The short rate is the random variable here. The simulation is used to calculate the probable impact of movements in the short rate on fixed rate investments.




What Professions Use the Monte Carlo Simulation?
It may be best known for its financial applications, but the Monte Carlo simulation is used in virtually every profession that must measure risks and prepare to meet them.For example, a telecom may build its network to sustain all of its users all of the time. In order to do that, it must consider all of the possible variations in demand for the service. It must determine whether the system will stand the strain of peak hours and peak seasons.A Monte Carlo simulation may help the telecom decide whether its service is likely to stand the strain of Super Bowl Sunday as well as an average Sunday in August.




What Factors Are Evaluated in a Monte Carlo Simulation?
A Monte Carlo simulation in investing is based on historical price data on the asset or assets being evaluated.The building blocks of the simulation, derived from the historical data, are drift, standard deviation, variance, and average price movement.
What Is a Month-to-Month Tenancy?  

A month-to-month tenancy is a periodic tenancy created when the renter is granted possession of the property with no definite expiration date and pays the owner on a monthly basis. This tenancy is most commonly found in residential leases. In situations wherein there is no written agreement, tenancy is also considered to be on a month-to-month basis.





Key Takeaways

Month-to-month tenancy is a periodic tenancy wherein the tenant rents from the owner on a monthly basis. This type of tenancy is most commonly found in residential leases.Other variations of tenancies found in lease contracts include tenancy for years, tenancy at will, and tenancy at sufferance. 


   How a Month-to-Month Tenancy Works  

Tenancy falls under the real estate laws that cover leases. In legal real estate terminology, a lease is a contract between the owner of a property, also known as the landlord, and a tenant, who rents the property. The lease transfers the owner’s rights to the exclusive possession and use of the property to the tenant for an agreed-upon period.



As anyone who has rented an apartment knows, the lease sets forth the period of time for which the contract is to run and the amount of rent the tenant is contracted to pay. The renter gains access to the property and uses it in whatever manner was agreed upon in the lease. The landlord receives rent for a specified period of time, and after the lease period is up their ownership rights are returned.





Pros

Control over the end date of the tenancy
Financial fluidity
Peace of mind



Cons

Moving out or replacing a tenant on short notice
Higher rents; less predictable income
Uncertainty





   Pros and Cons of a Month-to-Month Tenancy  

Whether a month-to-month tenancy is advantageous or disadvantageous depends, in part, on a renter's or landlord's desire for flexibility and ability to respond quickly to changing circumstances.


  Pros Explained  

Control over the end date. Renters are not tied down to a long-term lease and can choose to leave with relative impunity, with a maximum of 30 days' notice. Landlords can choose to end the arrangement with the same impunity, giving them greater control of their property.Financial fluidity. Landlords can change the rental amount every month if they wish. Renters can take advantage of a better offer elsewhere in quick fashion.Peace of mind. Renters are not stuck having to break a lease or find a sublessee in the event they want to move, either of which could happen if they leave before a long-term lease expires. Landlords can get rid of bad tenants much more easily than with a long-term lease.


  Cons Explained  

Moving out or replacing a tenant on short notice. Landlords can be stuck with an empty property on short notice. Renters can be forced to find new lodgings on the same short notice.Higher rents/less predictable income. Renters generally pay higher rents than with long-term leases, because of the possibility of sudden vacancies that can’t be immediately filled. Landlords can suffer from less predictable income than they would be afforded by a long-term lease.Uncertainty. Renters cannot be sure of their tenancy beyond the span of one month and so must have a quick move plan always in place. Landlords cannot be sure of a steady supply of tenants willing to live with the instability of a month-to-month tenancy.






Month-to-month tenancy falls under the real estate laws that cover leases.


   Different Types of Tenancy  

Within the lease contract, the tenant’s legal right to possess the property is deemed the leasehold estate—or tenancy. Depending upon the contract’s language, the following four different tenancies can be established:


  Tenancy for Years (aka Tenancy for Term)  

This establishes a possession for the tenant that will last for a fixed time period, which could range from days to years. It has a specific starting and ending date, with the latter signifying the expiration of the renter’s tenancy.


  Periodic Tenancy  

This is established when the renter’s possession is contracted for an indefinite period, with no agreed-upon expiration date. The tenancy is originally created for a specific period, but the renter’s tenancy can continue until there is some notification of the lease’s termination. Under the terms of the lease, the contract is automatically renewable until the owner or renter gives notice to terminate.


  Tenancy at Will  

A tenancy at will gives the renter the right to use the property for an unspecified period. The tenancy continues until the owner or renter gives notice of termination. In the event of either party’s death, the tenancy is terminated.


  Tenancy at Sufferance  

A tenancy at sufferance occurs when the renter, who at one time had established a contractual tenancy, continues to remain in the property without the owner’s consent. This can occur when the renter does not surrender the property after the initial expiration date written into the lease. It usually leads to eviction proceedings being instituted by the owner. If, however, the landlord accepts a rent payment after the lease expiration date, the property is considered to be leased again, but now on a month-to-month basis.
What Is Monthly Active Users (MAU)?  

Monthly active users (MAU) is a key performance indicator (KPI) used by social networking and other companies to count the number of unique users who have visited a site within the past month. Websites generally recognize monthly active users via an identification number, email address, or username.



MAU helps to measure an online business's general health and is the basis for calculating other website metrics. MAU is also useful when assessing the efficacy of a business's marketing campaigns and gauging both present and potential customers' experiences. Investors interested in the social media industry pay attention when companies report MAU, as it is a KPI that can affect a social-media company's stock price.





Key Takeaways

Monthly active users (MAU) track the number of unique users who visit a website or platform over some period of time.It is used as a benchmark for determining the performance, growth, or popularity of online sites.The problem with MAU is that companies do not use the exact parameters when calculating MAU.There are no industry standards for defining key measurements like "user" and "active."


   Who Uses MAU, and How?  

All too often, companies do not the same parameters when calculating MAU, and there are no industry standards for defining key metrics like "user" and "active." For this reason, critics of MAU believe that the metric creates unfair comparisons among competitors. Others think MAU is useful only in combination with other qualifying metrics, and some wonder if it is relevant.



As a quantitative assessment, MAU tabulates the number of visitors; there is no component that accounts for the depth, or quality, of a user's experience. For example, when calculating MAU, some companies consider a user as someone who has accessed their site. For other businesses, a user is one who has created a log-in and password. In others, an active user must meet specific requirements defined by the company.






Like many business metrics, MAU's usefulness depends on the company, its services, its competitors, and its audience.



For example, Meta (META), formerly Facebook, defines a monthly active user (MAU) as a registered and logged-in user. This user must have interacted with Facebook through the company's website or a mobile device or used its Messenger application (and is also a registered user) in the last 30 days as of the date of measurement. Meta also tracks daily active users (DAUs), who must meet the same requirements as MAUs to count, but meet those requirements on a daily rather than monthly basis.



X (formerly Twitter), on the other hand, stopped tracking monthly active users before it was acquired by Elon Musk and renamed X Corp. Instead, it looked at what it called monetizable daily active usage or users, or mDAU. Twitter defined mDAU as people, organizations, or other accounts "who logged in or were otherwise authenticated and accessed Twitter on any given day through twitter.com or Twitter applications that are able to show ads."



So, the difference begs the question—if Twitter's MAU did not include the same engagement variables as Meta's MAU, was the metric an apt comparison of the companies' site usage?


   Limits of MAU  

The fact that there are no uniform standards for the individual components of MAU, and other metrics used to quantify trends in social media, makes for a slippery playing field.



In 2015, Meta revised its definition of MAU, noting that it no longer counted people who were not active Facebook users but who shared content only via another site that integrated within the Facebook login.



Upon acquiring Instagram and WhatsApp, Meta made more adjustments to its user metrics. In 2022, it published plans to further change how they measure usage in its annual filing. The company has started using "Family" metrics that measure monthly and daily active people (MAP and DAP) across its family of platforms.






Family monthly active people increased Meta's metric by 2% year-over-year compared to monthly active users, likely because it accounted for users across all its platforms.



The change appears necessary because Meta has users with multiple accounts on several linked platforms, so there was no way to accurately estimate usage using MAU. For example, according to its annual filing, it had 2.96 billion Family DAP for December 2022, while there were 2.0 billion DAU for the same month. Family MAP averaged 3.73 billion that December, while MAU was 2.96 for the month. A clear distinction exists between measuring active people and active users—nearly one billion people's usage is not captured if the company relies on MAU.



While seemingly an apt move on Meta's part, this begs the question: With social media platforms becoming more centralized, have others also decided to change their usage calculations? If not, how do they compare their success in attracting and maintaining a user base beside year-over-year numbers?




What Is Considered an Active User?
An active user is someone who uses your service or product during a specific period. Each business can define "active" however they want, at least until industry standards are introduced.




How Do You Calculate Monthly Active Users?
You calculate MAU by dividing the sum of each month's unique users by 12. This is the average used by most businesses to report their MAU.




What Is MAU and DAU?
Monthly active users and daily active users are measurements used by companies that offer services or products for their customers to use. Each one reflects how many customers are using their services daily or monthly. Whether a user is active depends on the business' definition.


   The Bottom Line  

Monthly average users is a metric social media platforms, websites, and businesses use to measure engagement. It is a useful metric for gauging the number of accounts using a service. But it has become somewhat dated for some service providers, especially as service centralization occurs throughout an industry.



Meta makes a strong case for retiring this metric. However, while it is true that the variations in user metrics can make it difficult to compare social media companies, it is still a useful metric for smaller service platforms and companies with websites that are looking for engagement measurements.
What Is Moore's Law?  

Moore's Law states that the number of transistors on a microchip doubles every two years. The law claims that we can expect the speed and capability of our computers to increase every two years because of this, yet we will pay less for them. Another tenet of Moore's Law asserts that this growth is exponential. The law is attributed to Gordon Moore, the co-founder and former CEO of Intel.





Key Takeaways

Moore's Law states that the number of transistors on a microchip doubles about every two years, though the cost of computers is halved.In 1965, Gordon E. Moore, the co-founder of Intel, made this observation that became known as Moore's Law.Another tenet of Moore's Law says that the growth of microprocessors is exponential.

   Understanding Moore's Law  

In 1965, Gordon E. Moore—co-founder of Intel (INTC)—postulated that the number of transistors that can be packed into a given unit of space will double about every two years.



Gordon Moore did not call his observation "Moore's Law," nor did he set out to create a "law." Moore made that statement based on noticing emerging trends in chip manufacturing at Fairchild Semiconductor. Eventually, Moore's insight became a prediction, which in turn became the golden rule known as Moore's Law.



In the decades that followed Gordon Moore's original observation, Moore's Law guided the semiconductor industry in long-term planning and setting targets for research and development (R&D). Moore's Law has been a driving force of technological and social change, productivity, and economic growth that are hallmarks of the late 20th and early 21st centuries.






Moore's Law implies that computers, machines that run on computers, and computing power all become smaller, faster, and cheaper with time, as transistors on integrated circuits become more efficient.


   Nearly 60 Years Old and Still Strong  

More than 60 years later, we feel the lasting impact and benefits of Moore's Law in many ways.


  Computing  

As transistors in integrated circuits become more efficient, computers become smaller and faster. Chips and transistors are microscopic structures that contain carbon and silicon molecules, which are aligned perfectly to move electricity along the circuit faster. The faster a microchip processes electrical signals, the more efficient a computer becomes. The cost of higher-powered computers has been dropping annually, partly because of lower labor costs and reduced semiconductor prices.


  Electronics  

Practically every facet of a high-tech society benefits from Moore's Law in action. Mobile devices, such as smartphones and computer tablets would not work without tiny processors; neither would video games, spreadsheets, accurate weather forecasts, and global positioning systems (GPS).


  All Sectors Benefit  

Moreover, smaller and faster computers improve transportation, health care, education, and energy production—to name but a few of the industries that have progressed because of the increased power of computer chips.


   Moore's Law's Impending End  

Experts agree that computers should reach the physical limits of Moore's Law at some point in the 2020s. The high temperatures of transistors eventually would make it impossible to create smaller circuits. This is because cooling down the transistors takes more energy than the amount of energy that already passes through the transistors. In a 2005 interview, Moore himself admitted that "...the fact that materials are made of atoms is the fundamental limitation and it's not that far away...We're pushing up against some fairly fundamental limits so one of these days we're going to have to stop making things smaller."


   Creating the Impossible?  

The fact that Moore's Law may be approaching its natural death is perhaps most painfully present at the chip manufacturers themselves; as these companies are saddled with the task of building ever-more-powerful chips against the reality of physical odds. Even Intel is competing with itself and its industry to create what ultimately may not be possible.



In 2012, with its 22-nanometer (nm) processor, Intel was able to boast of having the world's smallest and most advanced transistors in a mass-produced product. In 2014, Intel launched an even smaller, more powerful 14nm chip; and today, the company is struggling to bring its 7nm chip to market.



For perspective, one nanometer is one billionth of a meter, smaller than the wavelength of visible light. The diameter of an atom ranges from about 0.1 to 0.5 nanometers.


   Special Considerations  

The vision of an endlessly empowered and interconnected future brings both challenges and benefits. Shrinking transistors have powered advances in computing for more than half a century, but soon engineers and scientists must find other ways to make computers more capable. Instead of physical processes, applications and software may help improve the speed and efficiency of computers. Cloud computing, wireless communication, the Internet of Things (IoT), and quantum physics all may play a role in the future of computer tech innovation.



Despite the growing concerns around privacy and security, the advantages of ever-smarter computing technology can help keep us healthier, safer, and more productive in the long run.




What Is Moore's Law?
In 1965, Gordon Moore posited that roughly every two years, the number of transistors on microchips will double. Commonly referred to as Moore’s Law, this phenomenon suggests that computational progress will become significantly faster, smaller, and more efficient over time. Widely regarded as one of the hallmark theories of the 21st century, Moore’s Law carries significant implications for the future of technological progress—along with its possible limitations.




How Has Moore’s Law Impacted Computing?
Moore’s Law has had a direct impact on the progress of computing power. What this means specifically, is that transistors in integrated circuits have become faster. Transistors conduct electricity, which contain carbon and silicon molecules that can make the electricity run faster across the circuit. The faster the integrated circuit conducts electricity, the faster the computer operates.




Is Moore’s Law Coming to an End?
According to expert opinion, Moore’s Law is estimated to end sometime in the 2020s. What this means is that computers are projected to reach their limits because transistors will be unable to operate within smaller circuits at increasingly higher temperatures. This is due to the fact that cooling the transistors will require more energy than the energy that passes through the transistor itself.
What Is Moral Hazard?  

Moral hazard is the risk that a party has not entered into a contract in good faith or has provided misleading information about its assets, liabilities, or credit capacity. In addition, moral hazard also may mean a party has an incentive to take unusual risks in a desperate attempt to earn a profit before the contract settles.



Moral hazards can be present anytime two parties come into agreement with one another. Each party in a contract may have the opportunity to gain from acting contrary to the principles laid out by the agreement.



Anytime a party in an agreement does not have to suffer the potential consequences of a risk, the likelihood of a moral hazard increases.





Key Takeaways

Moral hazard can exist when a party to a contract can take risks without having to suffer consequences.Moral hazard is common in the lending and insurance industries but also can exist in employee-employer relationships.Leading up to the 2008 financial crisis, the willingness of some homeowners to walk away from a mortgage was a previously unforeseen moral hazard.

   Understanding Moral Hazard  

A moral hazard occurs when one party in a transaction has the opportunity to assume additional risks that negatively affect the other party. The decision is based not on what is considered right but on what provides the highest level of benefit, hence the reference to morality. This can apply to activities within the financial industry, such as with the contract between a borrower and a lender, in addition to the insurance industry.



For example, when a property owner obtains insurance on a property, the contract is based on the idea that the property owner will avoid situations that may damage the property. The moral hazard exists that the property owner, because of the availability of the insurance, may be less inclined to protect the property, since the payment from an insurance company lessens the burden on the property owner in case of a disaster.



Moral hazards can exist in employer-employee relationships as well. If an employee has a company car for which they do not have to pay for repairs or maintenance, the employee might be less likely to be careful and more likely to take risks with the vehicle.






When moral hazards in investing lead to financial crises, the demand for stricter government regulations often increases.


   Examples of Moral Hazard  

Prior to the financial crisis of 2008, when the housing bubble burst, certain actions on the parts of lenders could qualify as moral hazards. For example, a mortgage broker working for an originating lender may have been encouraged through the use of incentives, such as commissions, to originate as many loans as possible regardless of the financial means of the borrower.



Since the loans were intended to be sold to investors, shifting the risk away from the lending institution, the mortgage broker and the originating lender experienced financial gains from the increased risk, while the burden of the aforementioned risk would ultimately fall on the investors.



Borrowers who began struggling to make their mortgage payments also experienced moral hazards when determining whether to attempt to meet the financial obligation or walk away from loans that were becoming more difficult to repay.



As property values decreased, borrowers were ending up deeper underwater on their loans. The homes were worth less than the amount owed on the associated mortgages. Some homeowners may have seen this as an incentive to walk away, as their financial burden would be lessened by abandoning a property.



Insurance coverage is also prone to moral hazard. For example, if someone buys the latest cell phone and takes out insurance on it, they may be less likely to be careful with it. The assumption that it will be replaced regardless of their level of care creates a moral hazard. Meanwhile, replacement costs of damaged cell phones then drive up the cost of insurance for everyone who might purchase the coverage.




What Does Moral Hazard Mean?
In economics, the term “moral hazard” refers to a situation where a party lacks the incentive to guard against a financial risk due to being protected from any potential consequences.




How Do You Manage Moral Hazards?
There are a few ways to minimize moral hazards. The first is to encourage the risk-taking party to act more responsibly by offering them incentives. The second is to institute policies that discourage immoral behavior by making it a punishable offense. Finally, regular monitoring allows the at-risk party to remain aware of whether or not the other party is taking advantage of them.




What Is the Difference Between Moral Hazard and Adverse Selection?
Moral hazard is a phenomenon wherein being protected from the consequences of one’s actions encourages additional risk-taking. Adverse selection refers to situations in which one party utilizes information they possess that another party doesn’t to ensure a trade is in their favor.As an example, a moral hazard is the risk that an employee who is enrolled in their company’s dental insurance plan may be less concerned about their oral hygiene, whereas someone who knowingly has a high-risk lifestyle is making an adverse selection by taking out a life insurance policy.


   The Bottom Line  

Moral hazards can be a high cost to businesses. Learning how to identify and mitigate them is essential to a business's profitability and longevity. Implementing practices or offering incentives that result in the risk-taking party having some "skin in the game" are means of tackling this problem.
What Is Moral Suasion?  

Moral suasion is the act of persuading a person or group to act in a certain way through rhetorical appeals, persuasion, or implicit and explicit threats—as opposed to the use of outright coercion or physical force. In economics, it is sometimes used in reference to central banks.





Key Takeaways

Moral suasion seeks to persuade an entity to act in a certain way through rhetorical appeals, persuasion or implicit threats, as opposed to the use of outright coercion or physical force.In economics, central bankers use moral suasion to influence market and public sentiment into believing that they are in control of the economy and ready to act if needed.Most of this moral suasion involves verbal gestures and signalling through central bank minutes that can be picked apart by analysts and journalists.A famous example of the use of moral suasion is the New York Federal Reserve's intervention in the bailout of Long-Term Capital Management (LTCM) in 1998.


   Understanding Moral Suasion  

Anyone can, in principle, use moral suasion to try to convince another party to change their attitude or behavior, but in an economic context it generally refers to central bankers' use of persuasive tactics in public or private. It is often simply called "suasion" and the motives behind it are not always altruistic, but have more to do with the pursuit of particular policies.



In the U.S., moral suasion is also known as "jawboning," since it amounts to talk, in contrast to more forceful methods the Federal Reserve (Fed) and other policymakers have at their disposal. More specifically, attempts by central banks to influence the rate of inflation without resorting to open market operations are sometimes called "open mouth operations."






Jawboning is becoming increasingly prevalent as many central banks, after years of low interest rates and aggressive monetary policy, have fewer alternative tools left to boost the economy.


  'Fedspeak'  

Moral suasion can be employed in public as well as behind closed doors. Fed chair Alan Greenspan's criticism of the prevailing economic mood as "irrational exuberance" in 1996 is remembered as a classic example of the Fed's use of suasion, but when asset prices did collapse in 2000, critics attacked Greenspan for having done too little—be it with interest rates, margin lending requirements or jawboning—to check the 1990s' exuberance.



In recent years the Fed has made a concerted effort to engage more with the public, which could be seen as an effort to increase transparency—or to leverage its power of moral suasion. Greenspan advocated a policy of "constructive ambiguity"—arguably the opposite of moral suasion—famously telling a senator, "if you understood what I said, I must have misspoke." Ben Bernanke broke with that approach and made an effort to communicate Fed policy more clearly; he introduced press conferences in 2011 at the suggestion of his eventual successor, Janet Yellen.



Increased jawboning may have been seen as necessary, given the decreased ability of the Fed to cut interest rates—which were near zero from December 2008 to December 2015—or increase the size of its balance sheet much further. With traditional monetary policy tools more difficult to employ, the Fed has attempted to convince markets of its willingness to support a sustained economic recovery through words rather than deeds, when possible.






Moral suasion is not limited to the U.S. In 2012 European Central Bank (ECB) president Mario Draghi said the bank would do "whatever it takes" to preserve the euro, which served to underpin the beleaguered currency and led to its subsequent rebound.


   Moral Suasion Example  

A famous example of the use of moral suasion is the New York Federal Reserve's intervention in the bailout of Long-Term Capital Management (LTCM) in 1998.



LTCM was a highly successful hedge fund, generating a string of high-double-digit annual returns in the 1990s. It was highly leveraged, however, with around $30 of debt per dollar of capital at the end of 1997. The Asian financial crisis sent it into a tailspin, leading to worries that a fire sale of its assets would drive down prices and leave its creditors—the bulk of Wall Street's major banks—with massive unpaid loans on their books.



Rather than directly injecting public money, the New York Fed called a meeting in its offices of three banks that had lent to LTCM. These banks decided to cooperate on a rescue, which the Fed helped coordinate but did not fund. Eventually, a consortium of 14 banks bailed LTCM out for $3.6 billion. The fund was liquidated two years later and the banks earned a slight profit.



The New York Fed was criticized for creating the impression that LTCM was "too big to fail," but the decision to pressure banks into providing bailout funds was seen as an alternative to more heavy-handed—and potentially harmful—tactics.
What Is a Moratorium?  

A moratorium is a temporary suspension of an activity or law until future consideration warrants lifting the suspension, such as if and when the issues that led to moratorium have been resolved. A moratorium may be imposed by a government, by regulators, or by a business.



Moratoriums are often imposed in response to temporary financial hardships. For example, a business that has exceeded its budget might place a moratorium on new hiring until the start of its next fiscal year. In legal proceedings, a moratorium can be imposed on an activity such as a debt collection process during bankruptcy proceedings.





Key Takeaways

A moratorium is a temporary halt of business as usual, or a suspension of some law or regulation.Most of the time, moratoriums are intended to alleviate short-term financial hardship or provide time to resolve related issues.In bankruptcy law, a moratorium is a legally-mandated hiatus in debt collection from creditors.


   How Moratoriums Work  

A moratorium is often, though not always, a response to a short-term crisis that disrupts the normal routine of a business. For instance, in the immediate aftermath of a natural disaster like an earthquake or flood, an emergency moratorium on some financial activities may be granted by a government. It will subsequently be lifted when normal business can commence once again.



If a company is experiencing financial difficulties, it can place a moratorium on certain activities to lower costs. The business may institute a hiring freeze, limit discretionary spending, or cut back on company travel and non-essential training. Moratoriums of this nature, designed solely to reduce unnecessary spending, are not meant to interrupt a business's ability or intent to repay its debts or to meet all necessary operational costs. They are instead taken to alleviate a financial shortfall or avoid default on debt obligations. The voluntary moratorium is a vehicle to bring spending back in line with current company revenues.



In bankruptcy law, a moratorium is a legally binding hiatus in the right to collect debts from an individual. This time-out period protects the debtor while a plan for recovery is agreed upon and put in place. This type of moratorium is typical in Chapter 13 bankruptcy filings in which the debtor seeks to restructure payments of outstanding debts.






Both "moratoriums" and "moratoria" are acceptable plurals of the term moratorium.


   Examples of Moratoriums  

As an example, in 2016, the governor of Puerto Rico issued an order to limit the withdrawal of funds from the Government Development Bank. This emergency moratorium established a hold on withdrawals that were not related to bank principal or interest payments in order to reduce risks to the bank's liquidity.



On the voluntary side, insurance companies will sometimes issue moratoriums on writing new policies for properties located in specific areas during the course of a natural disaster. Such moratoriums can help mitigate losses when the probability of filed claims is abnormally high. For example, in February 2011, MetLife issued a moratorium on writing new policies in many Texas counties due to an unusual outbreak of wildfires.
What Is the Morbidity Rate?  

Morbidity rate refers to the rate at which a disease or illness occurs in a population. This can be used to determine the health of a population and its health care needs. Illnesses can range from acute conditions to chronic, long-lasting conditions.



Morbidity rates are also used in actuarial professions—such as health insurance, life insurance, and long-term care insurance—to determine the premiums to charge customers. This rate shouldn't be confused with the mortality rate, another metric that highlights the frequency of death in a given population.





Key Takeaways

A morbidity rate tracks how acute and chronic diseases infect a populationMorbidity rates can be used to determine the overall health of a populationBy using a morbidity rate, the health care needs of a population can be determinedThese rates are also used in actuarial industries, such as insuranceInsurers use morbidity rates to develop policies for coverage, determine premiums, and set benefits for insurance claims


   Understanding Morbidity Rate  

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, morbidity refers to "any departure, subjective or objective, from a state of physiological or psychological well-being." In simpler terms, morbidity is the word used to describe the instance of a disease or illness, including acute and chronic conditions.



An acute condition may be caused by a virus and doesn't last very long, like a cold. Chronic conditions are more demanding on a population as they tend to be last longer, cost more to treat, and may need multiple layers of physical or mental health care.



They include such diseases as:



DiabetesCancerHeart diseaseKidney diseaseHIV/AIDSDepression



Because morbidity rates measure the frequency at which illness and disease occur in a population, they are used in various ways in the public and private sectors. For instance, governments may use morbidity rates and other health statistics to research health and health care. This includes costs, the success and failures of government programs, and the quality of health care systems.


   Morbidity Rates and Insurance  

Morbidity rates are also helpful in many sectors of the financial sector. For example, insurance companies use morbidity rates to predict the likelihood that an insured will contract or develop certain diseases. This helps them develop competitively-priced insurance policies in the industry for health insurance, life insurance, and coverage for long-term care.



The ability to accurately estimate morbidity rates for various diseases is helpful for insurers to set aside sufficient funds to cover benefits and claims for their customers. This data is also used in part to establish prices for the premiums that the insurance companies charge.



Other main factors in pricing premiums are mortality rates, operating expenses, investment returns, and regulations. For example. many insurance companies base their pricing of group insurance products on an expected payout of benefits. A company uses its assumptions for mortality, morbidity, interest, expenses, and persistence to price its products.






Don't confuse morbidity rates with mortality rates, which measure how many deaths occur in a specific population.


   Morbidity Rate vs. Mortality Rate  

People often confuse morbidity (rates) with mortality (rates). Although they sound the same, they are different. While morbidity rates refer to the frequency of disease and illness in a certain area, the mortality rate is used to describe the frequency of death in a population. Mortality is the direct result of a condition or illness. The mortality rate is determined by dividing the number of deaths that result from an illness by the total population.



Mortality rates can be divided into different categories based on various measures, including infant mortality and cause-related mortality.


   Other Rates for Diseases  

The proportion of initial disease cases to a population is an incidence rate. In contrast, the proportion of initial and existing disease cases in a population is known as the prevalence rate.



For example, 50,000 new cases of heart disease developed in a city with a population of five million in a single year, while the incidence of morbidity rate is 1%. If 250,000 people already suffer from heart disease in the city, the prevalence rate increases from 5% to 6%.




What Is the Definition of Morbidity?
The definition of morbidity as used by the medical community often refers to having a disease, a chronic health problem, or the amount of disease and illness within a population.




What Is the Difference Between Morbidity and Mortality?
The term morbidity refers to the rate at which an illness or disease occurs in a population. Mortality rate is the rate of death in a population.




What Is the Difference Between Morbidity Rate and Mortality Rate?
A morbidity rate tracks data on illness and disease within a population, while a mortality rate tracks the number of deaths from illness or disease within a population. Both morbidity and mortality rates are statistics used to measure the overall health of a population among other metrics.




How Can You Calculate Morbidity Rate?
Morbidity incidence rates are calculated by dividing the number of new cases of illness or disease within a specific period of time by the number of individuals in the population.


   The Bottom Line  

Understanding the difference between the definition of morbidity rate and mortality rate can help you better understand statistics related to illness and death. While the two terms sound the same, they apply to different metrics. A morbidity rate is the rate at which an illness or disease occurs withing a population, while a mortality rate is the rate of death.
What Is a Morning Star?  

A morning star is a visual pattern consisting of three candlesticks that are interpreted as bullish signs by technical analysts. A morning star forms following a downward trend and it indicates the start of an upward climb. It is a sign of a reversal in the previous price trend. Traders watch for the formation of a morning star and then seek confirmation that a reversal is indeed occurring using additional indicators.





Key Takeaways


A morning star is a visual pattern made up of a tall black candlestick, a smaller black or white candlestick with a short body and long wicks, and a third tall white candlestick.
The middle candle of the morning star captures a moment of market indecision where the bears begin to give way to bulls. The third candle confirms the reversal and can mark a new uptrend.
The opposite pattern to a morning star is the evening star, which signals a reversal of an uptrend into a downtrend.



   What Does a Morning Star Tell You?  

A morning star is a visual pattern, so there are no particular calculations to perform. A morning star is a three-candle pattern with the low point on the second candle; however, the low point is only apparent after the close of the third candle.



Other technical indicators can help predict if a morning star is forming, such as whether the price action is nearing a support zone or whether or not the relative strength indicator (RSI) is showing that the stock or commodity is oversold.



Here is what a morning star pattern looks like:

The chart above has been rendered in black and white, but red and green have become more common visualizations for candlesticks. The important thing to note about the morning star is that the middle candle can be black or white (or red or green) as the buyers and sellers start to balance out over the session.






   Trading a Morning Star  

Morning star patterns can be used as a visual sign for the start of a trend reversal from bearish to bullish, but they become more important when other technical indicators back them up as previously mentioned. Another important factor is the volume that is contributing to the pattern formation.



Generally, a trader wants to see volume increasing throughout the three sessions making up the pattern, with the third day seeing the most volume. High volume on the third day is often seen as a confirmation of the pattern (and a subsequent uptrend) regardless of other indicators.



A trader will take up a bullish position in the stock/commodity/pair/asset as the morning star forms in the third session and rides the uptrend until there are indications of another reversal.


   Morning Star vs. Doji Morning Star  

The morning star pattern comes in a minor variation. When the price action is essentially flat in the middle candlestick, it forms a doji. This is a small candlestick with no significant wicks—not unlike a + sign. The doji morning star shows the market indecision more clearly than a morning star with a thicker middle candle.



The appearance of a doji following a black candle will generally see a more aggressive volume spike and a correspondingly longer white candle due to more traders being able to clearly identify a morning star forming.


   Morning Star vs. Evening Star  

The opposite of a morning star is, of course, an evening star. The evening star is a long white candle followed by a short black or white one and then a long black one that goes down at least half the length of the white candle in the first session. The evening star signals a reversal of an uptrend with the bulls giving way to the bears.


   Limitations of the Morning Star Pattern  

Trading purely on visual patterns can be a risky proposition. A morning star is best when it is backed up by volume and some other indicator like a support level. Otherwise, it is very easy to see morning stars forming whenever a small candle pops up in a downtrend.




What Is the Difference Between Technical Analysis and Fundamental Analysis?
Both technical analysis and fundamental analysis are used by traders and investors in picking an investment as well as when to enter and exit the investment. Technical analysis uses historical data, mainly price and volume data to chart and predict an asset's future movements. Fundamental analysis aims to understand intrinsic value by analyzing economic and financial factors, such as the information found in a company's financial statements and how the macroeconomy will impact an asset.




Is a Morning Star Pattern Bullish?
Yes, a morning star pattern is bullish. It signals a weakness in a downtrend that may result in a trend reversal, which would be the start of an increase in an asset's price.




How Reliable Is a Morning Star Pattern?
Generally, a morning star pattern is very reliable, especially if it is incorporated with other technical indicators and further analysis of the asset. It is also a pattern that is helpful to both beginner and professional traders.


   The Bottom Line  

Technical analysis uses historical data of an asset's price and volume to predict the future movement of the asset's price. This data is displayed on charts, allowing traders to visualize movements and entry and exit points. The morning star is one pattern employed by technical traders that signals a bullish market.

What Is the Morningstar Risk Rating?  

The Morningstar risk rating, or simply Morningstar rating, is a ranking given to publicly traded mutual funds and exchange traded funds (ETFs) by the investment research firm Morningstar. Risk is assessed across five levels designed to help investors quickly identify funds to consider for their portfolios.



Funds receive ratings ranging from 1 to 5, with 1 given to the worst performers and 5 for the best. The ranking is based on variations in a fund's monthly returns—with an emphasis on downside variations—as compared to similar funds.





Key Takeaways

The Morningstar risk rating is a ranking given by research firm Morningstar to publicly traded mutual funds and exchange traded funds (ETFs).A score of 5 is given to the best risk performers, with a 1 to the worst.Morningstar ratings are based on the fund's historical performance compared to other like funds.Critics argue that Morningstar ratings don't look at the bigger picture where the funds are compared to the marketplace.Morningstar also provides category and peer-group ratings.


   Understanding the Morningstar Risk Rating  

Morningstar ratings are based on the fund's past performance as compared to other funds in its Morningstar category. The risk rating is frequently a starting point for additional research and is not a buy or sell recommendation.



In the risk rating process, 10% of a category's funds with the lowest measured risk are rated as "low risk." The next 22.5% are rated "below average," the middle 35% are "average," the next 22.5% "above average," while the top 10% are rated as "high" risk. Morningstar measures risk for as many as three periods (three, five, and 10 years). These separate measures are then weighted and averaged to produce an overall measure for the fund. Funds with less than three years of performance history are not rated.



Morningstar also provides category ratings and peer-group ratings to help investors further compare funds. For example, as of year-end 2018, Morningstar assigns a 3.9-star rating to municipal bond funds as a group, a 3.4-star rating to domestic stock funds, and a 3-star rating to international stock funds.






Morningstar rates individual mutual funds and ETFs and sells the ratings along with other research to investors.


   Other Risk Rating Providers  

Morningstar is not the only company that creates risk ratings. Other rating creators include Thomson Reuters Lipper, Zacks Investment Research, Standard and Poor's, and TheStreet.



Business and finance publications such as Forbes and U.S. News & World Report also rank and rate funds, as well as other asset classes, for their readers. In many cases, they base much of their analyses on ratings from Morningstar and the others.


   Criticism of Morningstar Risk Ratings  

While Morningstar ratings are considered essential in guiding investors toward quality investment decisions, they are not immune to criticism. Some financial analysts have criticized these ratings because they only compare funds to other funds, in isolation from the greater marketplace. As a result, a fund's rating may reflect its suitability for the particular market more than its overall viability and potential.



For example, as prices are rising in a bull market, funds with historically safe stocks from companies such as AT&T tend to perform well. Conversely, when prices are falling in a bear market, funds featuring speculative stocks from companies such as Tesla Motors and Charles Schwab tend to do better. As a result, some investors prefer ratings that keep the market conditions in mind, such as the ratings generated by Forbes.


   Example of Morningstar Risk Ratings  

To get an idea of how Morningstar assigns its risk ratings, let's look at its data on the iShares Nasdaq Biotechnology ETF (IBB). The exchange traded fund is rated as presenting investors with an above-average risk rating of three stars on a three-, five- and 10-year basis, based on a weighted average of the performance figures. Over the past 10 years, the fund has delivered an annualized total return of 15.38%, compared to 11.59% for the benchmark S&P 500 index. 




How Do Morningstar’s Star Risk Rating Work?
The star rating is a quantitative metric that indicates a mutual fund's historical risk-adjusted return. Funds can receive between 1 and 5 stars, with 5 being the best. A fund loses points for having a greater "risk penalty," so if two funds return the same yield in a given period, the fund that experienced greater volatility (variance) in returns would be rated lower, as riskier.




What Does a Morningstar Risk Rating of 5 Stars Mean?
A 5-star risk rating indicates that a fund has been among the market's top performers in terms of risk-adjusted return over the past three, five, or ten-year period.




How Reliable Are Morningstar Ratings?
While star ratings provide an easy heuristic for measuring risk-adjusted return in the past, they tend to be relatively poor predictors of future performance. A research study by Vanguard found that Morningstar ratings did not predict a profitable investment relative to a fund's benchmark. Moreover, the study found that one-star funds had the greatest excess returns of all compared to their benchmarks.
What Is the Morningstar Sustainability Rating?  

The Morningstar Sustainability Rating is a reliable and objective way for investors to see how thousands of mutual funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are meeting environmental, social, and corporate governance (ESG) challenges.



Introduced in 2016, Morningstar’s Sustainability Ratings are expressed using a five-globe system indicating whether the investment is at the bottom end of the rating for its industry group (one globe), below average (two globes), average (three globes), above average (four globes) or at the high end (five globes) of its industry group rating. Investors can find Morningstar’s sustainability ratings on the right-hand side of morningstar.com’s fund quote pages. The Morningstar Portfolio Sustainability Ratings are issued monthly.





Key Takeaways

The Morningstar Sustainability Rating helps investors evaluate funds based on environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors.Ratings are expressed using a five-globe system, with one globe being the worst score and five globes the best.Sustainability ratings are mainly based on the degree to which the economic value of the fund's holdings are at risk from ESG factors.Each company in the portfolio is graded on a scale of 0 to 100 relative to other firms in its global industry peer group.At least 67% of a portfolio’s assets under management must have a company ESG score for the portfolio to obtain a sustainability score.


   Understanding the Morningstar Sustainability Rating  

Morningstar’s development of this rating system reflects the dramatic increase and importance of sustainable investing.



its sustainability ratings are mainly based on Sustainalytics' ESG Risk Ratings, which essentially measure the degree to which a company’s economic value (enterprise value) is at risk from ESG factors. Each company in the portfolio is graded on a scale of 0 to 100 relative to other firms in its global industry peer group. The lower the score, the better.






Companies are rated relative to other firms in their global industry peer group, meaning two companies that have the same score but belong to different peer groups may not have equivalent levels of environmental, social, and corporate governance (ESG) performance.



At least 67% of a portfolio’s assets under management (AUM) must have a company ESG score for the portfolio to obtain a sustainability score. The Morningstar Sustainability Rating then takes the portfolio’s score and subtracts points for controversial ESG-related issues that companies in the portfolio may have. Controversies include incidents that impact the environment and society, such as oil spills, discrimination lawsuits, or events that affect the company.





67%

To receive an ESG Score, at least 67% of a portfolio’s assets under management must have a company ESG score.


   Morningstar Star Rating vs. Sustainability Rating  

According to Morningstar, funds with higher sustainability ratings tend to have higher-quality holdings. By higher quality, Morningstar is referring to funds with five-globe sustainability ratings that are more likely to have high star ratings for their risk-adjusted returns, are more likely to be favored by Morningstar analysts, are less volatile, and have more exposure to financially healthy companies with economic moats.



However, a fund may have a high star rating and a low sustainability rating. For example, Fidelity’s Total Market Index Premium fund (FSTVX) was given a four-star Morningstar rating out of five for its risk-adjusted returns. Morningstar’s premium analyst report called this fund “a great choice for diversified exposure to U.S. stocks of all sizes” thanks to its low cost and its “broad, market-cap-weighted coverage of the U.S. market.” It also carried a gold rating, indicating that analysts expect the fund to outperform over a full market cycle of at least five years. However, it only had a sustainability rating of two globes out of five (below average) based on an 80% ranking in its category and a sustainability score of 45.


   SRI Fund Alternative  

Morningstar’s Sustainability Ratings make it possible for investors to tilt their portfolios toward a sustainable investment philosophy without having to purchase sustainable, responsible and impact (SRI, formerly socially responsible investing) funds. SRI funds have several potential shortcomings: they represent a small percentage of the fund universe and studies have both proven and disproven their ability to offer higher returns compared to their non-SRI counterparts. As a result, many investors are hesitant to invest in SRI funds. In addition, investing in SRI funds can lead to overexposure in some sectors and underexposure in others.



Investors may be more inclined to choose one traditional fund over another based on the relative Morningstar Sustainability Ratings. If an investor is choosing between two large-cap growth funds with similar long-term performance and investment strategies, and one has a two-globe rating and the other a four-globe rating, the globe rating may be the deciding factor.




What is a good Morningstar sustainability rating?
The higher the rating, the better. Five globes imply that the fund’s investments are very ESG-friendly, whereas one globe is the worst score you can get. Three globes is average, so four could be considered a good sustainability rating.




Which companies provide ESG ratings?
Morningstar isn’t the only firm to score investments based on ESG. Others include MSCI, Bloomberg, Refinitiv and credit rating agencies such as Moody's, S&P, and Fitch.




Which company has the best ESG report?
Sustainalytics, Morningstar’s ESG and corporate governance research, ratings and analytics firm, publishes a list of its top-rated ESG companies on its website. U.S. companies that made its 2023 global top 50 list included Avnet, CBRE, Hasbro, and Inter-American Development Bank, and Universal Display.


   The Bottom Line  

Investors are increasingly paying more attention to environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors, such as climate change, how employees are treated, and executive pay. The Morningstar Sustainability Rating addresses these demands by essentially telling investors how the stocks held by funds behave in these areas.



Qualifying mutual funds and ETFs are given a rating of one to five based on how the companies they invest in rank in terms of ESG within their industry peer groups. The higher the Morningstar Sustainability Rating, the more ESG-friendly the fund.
What Is a Mortality Table?  

A mortality table, also known as a life table or actuarial table, shows the rate of deaths occurring in a defined population during a selected time interval, or survival rates from birth to death. A mortality table typically shows the general probability of a person's death before their next birthday, based on their current age. These tables are typically used in order to inform the construction of insurance policies and other forms of liability management. 





Key Takeaways

Mortality tables show the rate of death within a specific population. Mortality tables use a large number of factors to predict the likelihood of death in an individual within the current year.Mortality tables are used heavily by insurance companies and the U.S. Social Security Administration.Mortality tables are generally split into “period” life tables and “cohort” life tables. For the purposes of actuaries, “cohort” tables are most often used. 


   How a Mortality Table Works  

Mortality tables are mathematically complex grids of numbers that show the probability of death for members of a given population within a defined period of time, based on a large number of factored variables. Mortality tables tend to differ in their construction when being catered to men and women are usually constructed separately for men and women.



Other characteristics can also be included to distinguish different risks, such as smoking status, occupation, and socio-economic class. There are even actuarial tables that determine longevity in relation to weight. 



The life insurance industry relies heavily on mortality tables, as does the U.S. Social Security Administration. Both use mortality tables in order to best establish details surrounding their coverage policies based on the individuals they will cover. 






Mortality tables were first introduced by Raymond Pearl in 1921 for the purposes of furthering ecological studies


   Types of Mortality Tables  

In general practice, there are two types of mortality tables. First, the period life table is used to determine mortality rates for a specific time period of a certain population. The other type of actuarial life table is called the cohort life table, also referred to as a generation life table. It is used to represent the overall mortality rates of a certain population's entire lifetime. Between the two, the cohort life table is most often used due to its higher applicability to actuarialism. 


   Requirements for Mortality Tables   

Mortality tables are based on characteristics, such as gender and age. A mortality table gives probabilities based on deaths per thousand, or the number of people per 1,000 living who are expected to die in a given year. Life insurance companies use mortality tables to help determine premiums and to make sure the insurance company remains solvent.



Mortality tables typically cover from birth through age 100, in one-year increments. You can use a mortality table to look up the probability of death for someone of any age. Not surprisingly, the probability of death increases with age.



To use mortality tables, you first need the age of an individual to see what the table says about the chances that they will die when compared with the rest of the group. In the case of a newborn male, there is less than one half of one-10,000th of a percent that he will die when compared with the rest of the group. That would give him a life expectancy of around 75. However, according to the 2005 mortality table used by the Social Security Administration, a 119-year-old man has a more than 90 percent chance of dying when compared with the rest of the group, or a life expectancy of just over six months.
What Is a Mortgage?  

A mortgage is a type of loan used to purchase or maintain a home, land, or other types of real estate. The borrower agrees to pay the lender over time, typically in a series of regular payments that are divided into principal and interest. The property then serves as collateral to secure the loan.



A borrower must apply for a mortgage through their preferred lender and ensure that they meet several requirements, including minimum credit scores and down payments. Mortgage applications go through a rigorous underwriting process before they reach the closing phase. Mortgage types vary based on the needs of the borrower, such as conventional and fixed-rate loans.





Key Takeaways

   How Mortgages Work  

Individuals and businesses use mortgages to buy real estate without paying the entire purchase price up front. The borrower repays the loan plus interest over a specified number of years until they own the property free and clear. Most traditional mortgages are fully-amortizing. This means that the regular payment amount will stay the same, but different proportions of principal vs. interest will be paid over the life of the loan with each payment. Typical mortgage terms are for 30 or 15 years.



Mortgages are also known as liens against property or claims on property. If the borrower stops paying the mortgage, the lender can foreclose on the property.



For example, a residential homebuyer pledges their house to their lender, which then has a claim on the property. This ensures the lender’s interest in the property should the buyer default on their financial obligation. In the case of a foreclosure, the lender may evict the residents, sell the property, and use the money from the sale to pay off the mortgage debt.


   The Mortgage Process  

Would-be borrowers begin the process by applying to one or more mortgage lenders. The lender will ask for evidence that the borrower is capable of repaying the loan. This may include bank and investment statements, recent tax returns, and proof of current employment. The lender will generally run a credit check as well.



If the application is approved, the lender will offer the borrower a loan of up to a certain amount and at a particular interest rate. Homebuyers can apply for a mortgage after they have chosen a property to buy or while they are still shopping for one, a process known as pre-approval. Being pre-approved for a mortgage can give buyers an edge in a tight housing market because sellers will know that they have the money to back up their offer.



Once a buyer and seller agree on the terms of their deal, they or their representatives will meet at what’s called a closing. This is when the borrower makes their down payment to the lender. The seller will transfer ownership of the property to the buyer and receive the agreed-upon sum of money, and the buyer will sign any remaining mortgage documents. The lender may charge fees for originating the loan (sometimes in the form of points) at the closing.





Options

There are hundreds of options on where you can get a mortgage. You can get a mortgage through a credit union, bank, mortgage-specific lender, online-only lender, or mortgage broker. No matter which option you choose, compare rates across types to make sure that you’re getting the best deal.


   Types of Mortgages  

Mortgages come in a variety of forms. The most common types are 30-year and 15-year fixed-rate mortgages. Some mortgage terms are as short as five years, while others can run 40 years or longer. Stretching payments over more years may reduce the monthly payment, but it also increases the total amount of interest that the borrower pays over the life of the loan.



Within the different term lengths are numerous types of home loans, including Federal Housing Administration (FHA) loans, U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) loans, and U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) loans available for specific populations that may not have the income, credit scores, or down payments required to qualify for conventional mortgages.



The following are just a few examples of some of the most popular types of mortgage loans available to borrowers.


  Fixed-Rate Mortgages  

The standard type of mortgage is fixed-rate. With a fixed-rate mortgage, the interest rate stays the same for the entire term of the loan, as do the borrower's monthly payments toward the mortgage. A fixed-rate mortgage is also called a traditional mortgage. 





Warning

Mortgage lending discrimination is illegal. If you think you’ve been discriminated against based on race, religion, sex, marital status, use of public assistance, national origin, disability, or age, there are steps that you can take. One such step is to file a report with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD).


  Adjustable-Rate Mortgage (ARM)  

With an adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM), the interest rate is fixed for an initial term, after which it can change periodically based on prevailing interest rates. The initial interest rate is often a below-market rate, which can make the mortgage more affordable in the short term but possibly less affordable long-term if the rate rises substantially.



ARMs typically have limits, or caps, on how much the interest rate can rise each time it adjusts and in total over the life of the loan.






A 5/1 adjustable-rate mortgage is an ARM that maintains a fixed interest rate for the first five years, then adjusts each year after that.


  Interest-Only Loans  

Other, less common types of mortgages, such as interest-only mortgages and payment-option ARMs, can involve complex repayment schedules and are best used by sophisticated borrowers. These types of loans may feature a large balloon payment at its end.



Many homeowners got into financial trouble with these types of mortgages during the housing bubble of the early 2000s.


  Reverse Mortgages  

As their name suggests, reverse mortgages are a very different financial product. They are designed for homeowners age 62 or older who want to convert part of the equity in their homes into cash.



These homeowners can borrow against the value of their home and receive the money as a lump sum, fixed monthly payment, or line of credit. The entire loan balance becomes due when the borrower dies, moves away permanently, or sells the home.





Points

Within each type of mortgage, borrowers have the option to buy discount points to buy their interest rate down. Points are essentially a fee that borrowers pay up front to have a lower interest rate over the life of their loan. When comparing mortgage rates, make sure you are comparing rates with the same number of discount points for a true apples-to-apples comparison.


   Average Mortgage Rates (So Far for 2022)  

How much you’ll have to pay for a mortgage depends on the type of mortgage (such as fixed or adjustable), its term (such as 20 or 30 years), any discount points paid, and interest rates at the time. Interest rates can vary from week to week and from lender to lender, so it pays to shop around.



Mortgage rates were at near-record lows in 2020, with rates bottoming out at a 2.66% average on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage for the week of Dec. 24, 2020. Rates continued to stay stably low throughout 2021 and have started to climb steadily since Dec. 3, 2021 (see the chart below). According to the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp., average interest rates looked like this as of July 2022:



30-year fixed-rate mortgage: 5.30%15-year fixed-rate mortgage: 4.45%5/1 adjustable-rate mortgage: 4.19%

   How to Compare Mortgages  

Banks, savings and loan associations, and credit unions were virtually the only sources of mortgages at one time. Today, a burgeoning share of the mortgage market includes nonbank lenders, such as Better, loanDepot, Rocket Mortgage, and SoFi.



If you’re shopping for a mortgage, an online mortgage calculator can help you compare estimated monthly payments, based on the type of mortgage, the interest rate, and how large a down payment you plan to make. It also can help you determine how expensive a property you can reasonably afford.



In addition to the principal and interest that you’ll be paying on the mortgage, the lender or mortgage servicer may set up an escrow account to pay local property taxes, homeowners insurance premiums, and certain other expenses. Those costs will add to your monthly mortgage payment.



Also, note that if you make less than a 20% down payment when you take out your mortgage, your lender may require that you purchase private mortgage insurance (PMI), which becomes another added monthly cost.










If you have a mortgage, you still own your home (and not the bank). Your bank may have loaned you money to purchase the house, but rather than owning the property, they impose a lien on it (the house is used as collateral, but only if the loan goes into default). If you default and foreclose on your mortgage, however, the bank may become the new owner of your home.




Why do people need mortgages?
The price of a home is often far greater than the amount of money that most households save. As a result, mortgages allow individuals and families to purchase a home by putting down only a relatively small down payment, such as 20% of the purchase price, and obtaining a loan for the balance. The loan is then secured by the value of the property in case the borrower defaults.




Can anybody get a mortgage?
Mortgage lenders will need to approve prospective borrowers through an application and underwriting process. Home loans are only provided to those who have sufficient assets and income relative to their debts to practically carry the value of a home over time. A person’s credit score is also evaluated when making the decision to extend a mortgage. The interest rate on the mortgage also varies, with riskier borrowers receiving higher interest rates.Mortgages are offered by a variety of sources. Banks and credit unions often provide home loans. There are also specialized mortgage companies that deal only with home loans. You may also employ an unaffiliated mortgage broker to help you shop around for the best rate among different lenders.




What does fixed vs. variable mean on a mortgage?
Many mortgages carry a fixed interest rate. This means that the rate will not change for the entire term of the mortgage—typically 15 or 30 years—even if interest rates rise or fall in the future. A variable or adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM) has an interest rate that fluctuates over the loan’s life based on what interest rates are doing.




How many mortgages can I have on my home?
Lenders generally issue a first or primary mortgage before they allow for a second mortgage. This additional mortgage is commonly known as a home equity loan. Most lenders don’t provide for a subsequent mortgage backed by the same property. There’s technically no limit to how many junior loans you can have on your home as long as you have the equity, debt-to-income ratio, and credit score to get approved for them.




Why it called a mortgage?
The word "mortgage" comes from Old English and French meaning "death pledge." It gets that name since this type of loan "dies" when it is either fully repaid or if the borrower defaults.


   The Bottom Line  

Mortgages are an essential part of the home buying process for most borrowers who aren’t sitting on hundreds of thousands of dollars of cash to buy a property outright. Different types of home loans are available for whatever your circumstances may be. Different government-backed programs make it possible for more people to qualify for mortgages and make their dream of homeownership a reality.
What Is a Mortgage-Backed Security (MBS)?  

Mortgage-backed securities (MBS) are investment products similar to bonds. Each MBS consists of a bundle of home loans and other real estate debt bought from the banks that issued them. Investors in mortgage-backed securities receive periodic payments similar to bond coupon payments.





Key Takeaways

Mortgage-backed securities (MBS) turn a bank into an intermediary between the homebuyer and the investment industry.The bank handles the loans and then sells them at a discount to be packaged as MBSs to investors as a type of collateralized bond.For the investor, an MBS is as safe as the mortgage loans that back it up.

   Understanding Mortgage-Backed Security (MBS)  

Mortgage-backed securities (MBS) are variations of asset-backed securities that are formed by pooling together mortgages exclusively. The investor who buys a mortgage-backed security is essentially lending money to home buyers. An MBS can be bought and sold through a broker. The minimum investment varies between issuers.



As became glaringly obvious in the subprime mortgage meltdown of 2007-2008, a mortgage-backed security is only as sound as the mortgages that back it up. An MBS may also be called a mortgage-related security or a mortgage pass-through.



Essentially, the mortgage-backed security turns the bank into an intermediary between the homebuyer and the investment industry. A bank can grant mortgages to its customers and then sell them at a discount for inclusion in an MBS. The bank records the sale as a plus on its balance sheet and loses nothing if the homebuyer defaults sometime down the road.



This process works for all concerned as everyone does what they're supposed to do. That is, the bank keeps to reasonable standards for granting mortgages; the homeowner keeps paying on time, and the credit rating agencies that review MBS perform due diligence.



In order to be sold on the markets today, an MBS must be issued by a government-sponsored enterprise (GSE) or a private financial company. The mortgages must have originated from a regulated and authorized financial institution. And the MBS must have received one of the top two ratings issued by an accredited credit rating agency.






Mortgage-backed securities loaded up with subprime loans played a central role in the financial crisis that began in 2007 and wiped out trillions of dollars in wealth.


   Types of Mortgage-Backed Securities  

There are two common types of MBSs: pass-throughs and collateralized mortgage obligations (CMO).



Pass-throughs: Pass-throughs are structured as trusts in which mortgage payments are collected and passed through to investors. They typically have stated maturities of five, 15, or 30 years. The life of a pass-through may be less than the stated maturity depending on the principal payments on the mortgages that make up the pass-through.
Collateralized mortgage obligations (CMO): CMOs consist of multiple pools of securities which are known as slices, or tranches. The tranches are given credit ratings which determine the rates that are returned to investors.






   History of MBS  

Mortgage-backed securities were introduced after the passage of the Housing and Urban Development Act in 1968. The act created the Government National Mortgage Association, or Ginnie Mae, which was split off from Fannie Mae.



The new body allowed banks to sell their mortgages to third parties so that they would have more capital to lend out and originate new loans. This in turn made it possible for institutional funds to buy up and package many loans into an MBS.



Ginnie Mae introduced the first mortgage-backed securities for the retail housing market in 1970. The first private MBS was introduced by Bank of America in 1977.


   MBS and the Financial Crisis of 2007/2008  

Mortgage-backed securities played a central role in the financial crisis that began in 2007 and went on to wipe out trillions of dollars in wealth, bring down Lehman Brothers, and roil the world financial markets.



In retrospect, it seems inevitable that the rapid increase in home prices and the growing demand for MBS would encourage banks to lower their lending standards and drive consumers to jump into the market at any cost.


  The Crisis  

That was the beginning of the subprime MBS. With Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae aggressively supporting the mortgage market, the quality of all mortgage-backed securities declined, and their ratings became meaningless. Then, in 2006, housing prices peaked.



Subprime borrowers started to default, which is the failure to repay a loan. As a result, the housing market began its long collapse. More people began walking away from their mortgages because their homes were worth less than their loans. Even the conventional mortgages underpinning the MBS market saw steep declines in value. The avalanche of non-payments meant that many MBSs and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) based on pools of mortgages were vastly overvalued.



The losses piled up as institutional investors and banks tried and failed to unload bad MBS investments. Credit tightened, causing many banks and financial institutions to teeter on the brink of insolvency. Lending was disrupted to the point that the entire economy was at risk of collapse.


  The Bailout  

The U.S. Treasury stepped in with Congress to authorize a $700 billion financial system bailout intended to ease the credit crunch. Also, the Federal Reserve bought $4.5 trillion in MBS over a period of years while the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) injected capital directly into banks.



Some of the measures of the bailout included the following:



Nearly $250 billion to stabilize the banking Industry nearly
$27 billion o stabilize the credit markets
$80 billion to support the U.S. auto industry
Almost $70 billion to bail out the insurance giant, AIG for the American International Group
$46 billion was allocated to help struggling families avoid home foreclosure, which is when a mortgage lender or bank seizes a borrower's home due to nonpayment of the loan



On Oct. 3, 2010, the authority to initiate new financial commitments ceased, essentially ending any new bailouts under the TARP program.



Also, in 2010, Congress authorized the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. The Dodd-Frank Act reduced the initial amount of the $700 billion authorized for the TARP program to $475 billion.


   Advantages and Disadvantages of MBS  
  Attractive Yield  

For investors, mortgage-backed securities have some advantages over other securities. They pay a fixed interest rate that is usually higher than U.S. government bonds. Moreover, they typically offer monthly payouts, whereas bonds offer a single lump-sum payout at maturity.


  Safe Investments  

Mortgage-backed securities are also considered relatively low-risk, especially once seasoned. If an MBS is guaranteed by the federal government, investors do not have to absorb the costs of a borrower's default. Moreover, they also offer diversification from the markets of corporate and government securities.


  Prepayment Risk  

If borrowers fail to repay their loans, the investor may ultimately lose money. Also, if borrowers pay off their loans early or refinance their loans, that can also have a negative impact on expected returns. The weighted average coupon (WAC) can estimate the pre-payment characteristics of a pool of underlying mortgages. The WAC will change periodically as mortgages are paid off.


  Interest Rate Risk  

MBSs are also sensitive to changes in the interest rates on loans and mortgages. If interest rates rise, fewer people will take out mortgages causing the overall value of the housing market to decline.




MBS Pros and Cons 

Pros

Fixed interest rate and monthly payouts.
More diversification than single loans.
Relatively low correlation with corporate bonds or the stock market.



Cons

Returns may be affected by borrowers refinancing or paying off their loans early.
If interest rates increase, the price of an MBS may drop.





   Mortgage-Backed Securities Today  

Mortgage-backed securities are still bought and sold today. There is a market for them again simply because people generally pay their mortgages if they can. The Fed still owns a huge chunk of the market for MBSs, but it is gradually selling off its holdings.



Even CDOs have returned after falling out of favor for a few years post-crisis. The assumption is that Wall Street has learned its lesson and will question the value of MBSs rather than heedlessly buying them. Time will tell.




What Are the Types of Mortgage-Backed Securities (MBS)?
There are two common types of MBSs: pass-throughs and collateralized mortgage obligations (CMO). Pass-throughs are structured as trusts in which mortgage payments are collected and passed through to investors. They typically have stated maturities of five, 15, or 30 years. CMOs consist of multiple pools of securities which are known as slices, or tranches. The tranches are given credit ratings which determine the rates that are returned to investors.




What's the Relationship Between MBS and a Bank?
Essentially, the mortgage-backed security turns the bank into an intermediary between the homebuyer and the investment industry. A bank can grant mortgages to its customers and then sell them at a discount for inclusion in an MBS. The bank records the sale as a plus on its balance sheet and loses nothing if the homebuyer defaults sometime down the road.This process works for all concerned as long as everyone does what they're supposed to do. That is, the bank keeps to reasonable standards for granting mortgages; the homeowner keeps paying on time, and the credit rating agencies that review MBS perform due diligence.




What Is an Asset-Backed Security (ABS)?
An asset-backed security (ABS) is a type of financial investment that is collateralized by an underlying pool of assets—usually ones that generate a cash flow from debt, such as loans, leases, credit card balances, or receivables. It takes the form of a bond or note, paying income at a fixed rate for a set amount of time, until maturity.For income-oriented investors, ABSs can be an alternative to other debt instruments, like corporate bonds or bond funds. For issuers, ABSs allow them to raise cash which can be used for lending or other investment purposes. 


   The Bottom Line  

A mortgage-backed security is a type of investment vehicle composed of a large basket of mortgages. As each homeowner pays off their loans, the loan payments provide a steady income stream for investors who hold the MBS. These securities may be particularly attractive to investors who seek exposure to the housing market, rather than ordinary corporate or debt securities.
What Is a Mortgage Banker?  

A mortgage banker is a company, individual, or institution that originates mortgages. Mortgage bankers use their own funds, or funds borrowed from a warehouse lender, to fund mortgages. After a mortgage is originated, a mortgage banker might retain the mortgage in a portfolio, or they might sell the mortgage to an investor. Additionally, after a mortgage is originated, a mortgage banker might service the mortgage, or they might sell the servicing rights to another financial institution. A mortgage banker's primary business is to earn the fees associated with loan origination. Most mortgage bankers do not retain the mortgage in a portfolio.





Key Takeaways

A mortgage banker is a company or individual that originates mortgages, using their own or borrowed funds.Mortgage bankers earn fees from loan originations, typically working in the loan department of a bank or financial institution.  The mortgage banker can approve or reject a mortgage application, while also acting as an advisor to borrowers—helping them choose the best option.Mortgage bankers and mortgage brokers are loan officers, but bankers use their own funds while brokers facilitate originations for other institutions.


   Understanding Mortgage Bankers  

A mortgage banker typically works in the loan department of a financial institution, a credit union, a savings and loan association, or a bank. They work with realtors and individuals seeking loans through the entirety of the mortgage process, from evaluating the property to collecting financial information and securing the loan. A mortgage banker also acts as an advisor to the borrowers as they assist the loan applicants in choosing between the institution's various loan options. 






Mortgage bankers close loans in their own names, using their own funds or the funds of their institutions.



Mortgage bankers work for an institution, which means they can only make loans from their institution. They are paid by their institution (typically on a salary, although sometimes institutions offer performance-based bonuses), and because their loyalties lie with their institution, they must make sure the loans are properly secured and the borrower is qualified to make the monthly payments. Larger mortgage bankers service mortgages, while smaller mortgage bankers tend to sell the servicing rights.



A mortgage banker has the ability to approve a mortgage for a lender. Because they work for the lending institution that is providing the money for the mortgage, mortgage bankers can be the difference between an approved loan application and a rejected loan application when there's an instance in which requires an exception or subjective decision.


   Mortgage Banker vs. Mortgage Broker  

A mortgage banker and a mortgage broker are similar in that they can both help you get a home loan. They are also both designated "loan officers" by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). The distinguishing feature between a mortgage banker and a mortgage broker is that mortgage bankers close mortgages in their own names, using their own funds, while mortgage brokers facilitate originations for other financial institutions. Mortgage brokers do not close mortgages in their own names—they are the middlemen between the person seeking the loan and the lender. Unlike mortgage bankers, mortgage brokers don't represent one institution. Instead, they shop around to find a loan suitable for the individual they are working with.
What is a Mortgage Bond?  

A mortgage bond is secured by a mortgage, or a pool of mortgages, that are typically backed by real estate holdings and real property, such as equipment.





Key Takeaways

A mortgage bond is a bond backed by real estate holdings or real property.In the event of a default situation, mortgage bondholders could sell off the underlying property backing a bond to compensate for the default.Mortgage bonds tend to be safer than corporate bonds and, therefore, typically have a lower rate of return.


   Understanding Mortgage Bonds  

Mortgage bonds offer the investor protection because the principal is secured by a valuable asset. In the event of default, mortgage bondholders could sell off the underlying property to compensate for the default and secure payment of dividends. However, because of this inherent safety, the average mortgage bond tends to yield a lower rate of return than traditional corporate bonds that are backed only by the corporation's promise and ability to pay.



When a person buys a home and finances the purchase with a mortgage, the lender rarely retains ownership of the mortgage. Instead, it sells the mortgage on the secondary market to another entity, such as an investment bank or government-sponsored enterprise (GSE). This entity packages the mortgage with a pool of other loans and issues bonds with the mortgages as backing.



When homeowners pay their mortgages, the interest portion of their payment is used to pay the yield on these mortgage bonds. As long as most of the homeowners in the mortgage pool keep up with their payments, a mortgage bond is a safe and reliable income-producing security.


   Advantages and Disadvantages of Mortgage Bonds  

A disadvantage of mortgage bonds is that their yields tend to be lower than corporate bond yields because the securitization of mortgages makes such bonds safer investments. An advantage would that if a homeowner defaults on a mortgage, the bondholders have a claim on the value of the homeowner's property. The property can be liquidated with the proceeds used to compensate bondholders. Another advantage of mortgage bonds is that they are a safer investment than stocks, for example.



In contrast, investors in corporate bonds have little to no recourse if the corporation is unable to pay. As a result, when corporations issue bonds, they must offer higher yields to entice investors to shoulder the risk of unsecured debt.

   Special Considerations for Mortgage Bonds  

One major exception to the general rule that mortgage bonds represent a safe investment became evident during the financial crisis of the late 2000s. Leading up to this period, investors realized they could earn higher yields purchasing bonds backed by subprime mortgages—mortgages offered to buyers with poor credit or unverifiable income—while still enjoying the supposed security of investing in collateralized debt.



Unfortunately, enough of these subprime mortgages defaulted to cause a crisis during which many mortgage bonds defaulted costing investors millions of dollars. Since the crisis, there has been heightened scrutiny over such securities. Nevertheless, the Fed still holds a sizable amount of mortgage-backed securities (MBS) such as mortgage bonds. As of Feb. 2021, the Fed held around $2.1 trillion in MBS, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.﻿﻿
What Is a Mortgage Broker?  

A mortgage broker is an intermediary who brings mortgage borrowers and mortgage lenders together, but who does not use their own funds to originate mortgages.



A mortgage broker helps borrowers connect with lenders and seeks out the best lender for the borrower's financial situation and interest-rate needs. They do the legwork so a borrower doesn't have to.



The mortgage broker also gathers paperwork from the borrower and passes it along to a mortgage lender for underwriting and approval purposes. The broker earns a commission from either the borrower, the lender, or both at closing.



A mortgage broker should not be confused with a mortgage banker, which closes and funds a mortgage with its own funds.





Key Takeaways

A mortgage broker is a financial intermediary who matches home borrowers with potential lenders in order to obtain the best possible mortgage terms for the borrower.A mortgage broker can save a borrower time and effort during the application process, and potentially a lot of money over the life of the loan.Mortgage brokers earn commissions, known as origination fees, based on the size of the loan, and may work independently or as en employee of a larger mortgage brokerage firm.You don't have to work with a mortgage broker to get a mortgage.However, some lenders only work with mortgage brokers so a broker may be a good option when seeking a home loan.


   How Mortgage Brokers Work  

A mortgage broker serves as the intermediary between borrowers and lenders in the real estate market. Whether a potential borrower is buying a new home or refinancing, a mortgage broker is responsible for presenting loan options from various lenders to the borrower for consideration, while qualifying the borrower for a mortgage with those lenders at the same time.


  Additional Responsibilities  

The mortgage broker also gathers from the borrower the financial information needed for the mortgage application process. This information pertains to income, assets, debt, employment documentation, a credit report, and other data lenders can use to assess the borrower’s ability to secure financing and pay a loan. The mortgage broker then passes it on to potential lenders.



The broker determines an appropriate loan amount, loan-to-value (LTV) ratio, and the borrower’s ideal loan type. They then submit the application to a lender for approval. The broker communicates with the borrower and the lender during the entire transaction through closing.



Once agreed upon, mortgage funds are loaned in the name of the mortgage lender, and the mortgage broker collects a commission called an origination fee from the lender as compensation for their services. The borrower may be responsible for paying all or part of that fee in the closing statement. The mortgage broker only gets paid when the loan transaction is completed.



Borrowers should search online reviews and ask for referrals from real estate agents, friends, and family for a mortgage broker who has the right credentials for the borrower's level of experience. It's important to work with an individual whom you trust and who provides good service.






The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is authorized to maintain oversight over mortgage brokers, as well as loan originators and servicers.


   Advantages and Disadvantages of Mortgage Brokers  
  Advantages  

Mortgage brokers can save borrowers time and effort by finding a variety of potential lenders for them.They can help borrowers avoid lenders who may not meet their needs or even be unscrupulous.The can provide borrowers with access to lenders that might otherwise not be available to them.They can offer impactful financial savings through potential fee waivers and better loan rates.


  Disadvantages  

Some lenders you contact directly could offer the same or better terms they'd offer through a mortgage broker.You pay a fee for a mortgage broker's services.Some lenders don't work through mortgage brokers and you could miss out on a lender offering attractive loan terms.Some mortgage brokers may have conflicts of interest, e.g., direct you to lenders who pay them more rather than to those who are better for your needs.


   Mortgage Brokers vs. Loan Officers  

When consumers wish to buy or refinance a home, often their first step is to contact a loan officer in a local bank or credit union. A bank loan officer offers programs and mortgage rates from a single institution.



By contrast, a mortgage broker works on a borrower’s behalf to find the lowest available mortgage rates and/or the best loan programs available through multiple lenders.



However, the number of lenders a mortgage broker can access is limited by their approval to work with each lender. That means that borrowers are generally best served by doing some of their own legwork as well in order to find the best deal.



A mortgage broker often works with several clients at one time and does not get paid unless a loan closes. This encourages mortgage brokers to work with each borrower on a more personal level. If a loan originated through the efforts of a mortgage broker is declined, the broker applies to another lender.



A loan officer from a big bank may keep a borrower waiting for an extended period of time because the officer is working with many borrowers at once. If a loan originating through a loan officer is declined, no further action is taken by the loan officer or bank.



Some lenders work exclusively with mortgage brokers, providing borrowers access to loans that would otherwise not be available to them. In addition, mortgage brokers can get lenders to waive application, appraisal, origination, and other fees. Big banks work exclusively with loan officers and do not waive fees.




Can I Get a Home Loan Without a Mortgage Broker?
Yes, you can. However, finding a home loan isn't easy and a mortgage broker can do the heavy lifting for you. Their essential purpose is to match borrowers with lenders.




Do Mortgage Brokers Have Conflicts of Interest?
Perhaps. Since mortgage brokers usually earn a commission when they bring lenders business, there's room for a fundamental conflict of interest. Also, they could potentially steer borrowers to lenders that pay them better than others (lenders that may suit a borrower better). Loan officers who are paid salaries rather than commissions aren't motivated in this way.




Why Would You Go to a Mortgage Broker?
Mortgage brokers may be a good fit for you when seeking out a mortgage because they can provide you with access to various lenders that you'd otherwise not learn about. They can help you with the large amount of paperwork you'll need to provide and your loan application. Also, some lenders only work through mortgage brokers.


   The Bottom Line  

A mortgage broker is a type of broker who matches home loan seekers with lenders offering the best loans for their needs. They can save borrowers an enormous amount of time and effort (and possibly money) relating to the mortgage process, for a fee.



Be sure that you do the proper amount of research into mortgage broker costs, reputation, services, and benefits before you decide to enlist the help of a broker rather than get a mortgage yourself.
What Is a Mortgage Forbearance Agreement?  

A mortgage forbearance agreement is an agreement made between a mortgage lender and a delinquent borrower. In this agreement, a lender agrees not to exercise its legal right to foreclose on a mortgage, and the borrower agrees to a mortgage plan that will—over a certain time period—bring the borrower current on their payments.



The coronavirus outbreak triggered forbearance help beginning March 18, 2020. Legislation and policies in the wake of the 2020 economic crisis have sought to offer relief to homeowners struggling to make mortgage payments since then.





Key Takeaways

A mortgage forbearance agreement is a plan made between a lender and a borrower who is struggling to make mortgage payments that attempts to allow the borrower to fulfill the mortgage obligation and avoid foreclosure.The agreement generally reduces or entirely suspends mortgage payments for a set time period during which the lender agrees not to foreclose on the property.It is intended for borrowers with temporary financial problems and is not considered a long-term solution.In some cases, a lender may agree to extend a mortgage forbearance agreement beyond its initial end date.


   How a Mortgage Forbearance Agreement Works  

A mortgage forbearance agreement is made when a borrower has a difficult time meeting their payments. With the agreement, the lender agrees to reduce—or even suspend entirely—mortgage payments for a certain period of time. They also agree not to initiate a foreclosure during the forbearance period.



The borrower must resume the full payment at the end of the period, plus pay an additional amount to get current on the missed payments, including principal, interest, taxes, and insurance. The terms of the agreement will vary among lenders and situations. With a regular forbearance agreement, even though payments may be suspended for a while, interest continues to accrue.






Mortgage lending discrimination is illegal. If you think you've been discriminated against based on race, religion, sex, marital status, use of public assistance, national origin, disability, or age, there are steps you can take. One such step is to file a report to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau or with the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). 



A mortgage forbearance agreement is not a long-term solution for delinquent borrowers. Rather, it is designed for borrowers who have temporary financial problems caused by unforeseen problems, such as temporary unemployment or health issues. Borrowers with more-fundamental financial problems—such as having chosen an adjustable-rate mortgage on which the interest rate has reset to a level that makes the monthly payments unaffordable—must usually seek other remedies.



A forbearance agreement may allow a borrower to avoid foreclosure until their financial situation gets better. In some cases, the lender may be able to extend the forbearance period if the borrower’s hardship is not resolved by the original agreed-upon end date.






A loan modification is meant to be a permanent solution to unaffordable monthly mortgage payments through renegotiation of the mortgage terms rather than the temporary suspension or reduction of payments.


   Mortgage Forbearance Agreement vs. Loan Modification  

While a mortgage forbearance agreement provides short-term relief for borrowers, a loan modification agreement is a permanent solution to unaffordable monthly payments. With a loan modification, the lender can work with the borrower to do a few things such as—reduce the interest rate, convert from a variable interest rate to a fixed interest rate, or extend the length of the loan term—in order to reduce the borrower’s monthly payments.



In order to be eligible for a loan modification, borrowers must show that they cannot make the current mortgage payments because of financial hardship, demonstrate that they can afford the new payment amount by completing a trial period and provide all required documentation to the lender. The documentation the lender requires varies by lender, but it may include a financial statement, proof of income, tax returns, bank statements, and a hardship statement.






Legislation related to the 2020 economic crisis provides special mortgage forbearance help to homeowners with federally-backed home loans, including loans backed by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, FHA/HUD, VA, and USDA.


   Mortgage Forbearance Agreements and COVID-19  

Legislation related to the 2020 economic crisis offers special mortgage forbearance help for homeowners with federally-backed home loans. This includes HUD/FHA, VA, USDA, Fannie Mae, and Freddie Mac mortgages. To be eligible for COVID-19 mortgage forbearance, you must have experienced financial hardship directly or indirectly due to the coronavirus pandemic.



Although private mortgages that are not federally backed are not covered by the legislation, private loan servicers may offer similar forbearance options. If you struggle to make mortgage payments, know that all loan servicers are generally required to discuss payment options with you, even if your loan is not federally backed.


  Eligibility  

You are eligible for COVID-19 mortgage forbearance if you have an HUD/FHA, VA, USDA, Fannie Mae, or Freddie Mac mortgage AND you experience financial hardship directly or indirectly due to the coronavirus pandemic. No proof of hardship is required.


  Deadline to Apply  

For a HUD/FHA, USDA, or VA loan, the deadline to apply for an initial forbearance was June 30, 2021, though the White House announced at the end of July that the enrollment period would be extended to Sept. 30, 2021. If your mortgage loan is backed by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac, there is currently no deadline to request an initial forbearance.



Since private loans are not covered by COVID legislation, private mortgage COVID-19 loan forbearance is whatever you can negotiate with your lender. Therefore, the application deadline, if one exists, is up to the mortgage servicer.






The deadline to apply is for "initial forbearance" (typically 3 to 6 months). Once you have applied and been granted forbearance, you can extend for up to one year.


  Length of Forbearance  

Since COVID-19 forbearance is regulated, it has a specific time length. Most initial forbearance agreements are scheduled to last 3 to 6 months with renewal up to 12 months. In certain cases, depending on when you began your initial forbearance your total can be as much as 18 months.



If your mortgage is backed by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac AND you were in an active forbearance plan as of Feb. 28, 2021, you can request up to 18 months' total forbearance.If your mortgage is backed by HUD/FHA, USDA, or VA, and your initial forbearance was in effect on or before June 30, 2020, you can request up to 18 months' total forbearance on that loan as well.


  Other Provisions of COVID-19 Mortgage Forbearance  

COVID-19 mortgage forbearance agreements also include specific non-negotiable provisions that may or may not be found in regular mortgage forbearance agreements.



Payments can be deferred or reduced.Interest accrues but is not capitalized.No additional fees or penalties will be levied.


  Homeowner Assistance Fund  

Passage of the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 included the nearly $10 billion Homeowner Assistance Fund, designed to be disbursed to states and used to provide help to homeowners in danger of foreclosure or eviction.



Funds will also be used to help homeowners avoid delinquencies, defaults, loss of utilities, or home energy services, or otherwise experiencing financial hardship related to mortgages and housing.


  When Forbearance Ends  

At the end of COVID-19 mortgage forbearance, your repayment options vary depending on the agency. One, across-the-board stipulation, is the prohibition against requiring borrowers to repay the deferred amount in a lump sum.



Typical repayment options include the following. Not all borrowers will be eligible for all options.



Repayment - A portion of the amount you owe will be added to your regular payment.Deferral/partial claim - Your missed payments will be moved to the end of your mortgage or placed in a lien that will be paid off when you refinance, sell, or terminate your mortgage.Modification - Your payment will be lowered and the amount you owe added to the loan. It will take longer to pay off your loan.Lump-sum - You cannot be required to accept this option which would involve paying off the entire delinquent amount in one payment.
What Is Mortgage Insurance?  

Mortgage insurance is an insurance policy that protects a mortgage lender or titleholder if the borrower defaults on payments, passes away, or is otherwise unable to meet the contractual obligations of the mortgage. Mortgage insurance can refer to private mortgage insurance (PMI), qualified mortgage insurance premium (MIP) insurance, or mortgage title insurance. What these have in common is an obligation to make the lender or property holder whole in the event of specific cases of loss.



Mortgage life insurance, on the other hand, which sounds similar, is designed to protect heirs if the borrower dies while owing mortgage payments. It may pay off either the lender or the heirs, depending on the terms of the policy.





Key Takeaways


Mortgage insurance refers to an insurance policy that protects a lender or titleholder if the borrower defaults on payments, passes away, or is otherwise unable to meet the contractual obligations of the mortgage.
Three types of mortgage insurance include private mortgage insurance, qualified mortgage insurance premium, and mortgage title insurance.
It should not be confused with mortgage life insurance, which pertains to the protection of heirs if the borrower dies while owing mortgage payments.



   How Mortgage Insurance Works  

Mortgage insurance may come with a typical pay-as-you-go premium payment, or it may be capitalized into a lump-sum payment at the time of mortgage origination. For homeowners who are required to have PMI because of the 80% loan-to-value ratio rule, they can request that the insurance policy be canceled once 20% of the principal balance has been paid off.



Here are three types of mortgage insurance:


   Private Mortgage Insurance (PMI)  

Private mortgage insurance (PMI) is a type of mortgage insurance a borrower might be required to buy as a condition of a conventional mortgage loan. Like other kinds of mortgage insurance, PMI protects the lender, not the borrower. The lender arranges PMI and it's provided by private insurance companies.



PMI is usually required if a borrower gets a conventional loan with a down payment of less than 20%. A lender might also require PMI if a borrower is refinancing with a conventional loan, and equity is less than 20% of home value.


   Qualified Mortgage Insurance Premium (MIP)  

When you get a U.S. Federal Housing Administration (FHA)-backed mortgage, you will be required to pay a qualified mortgage insurance premium, which provides a similar type of insurance. MIPs have different rules, including that everyone who has an FHA mortgage must buy this type of insurance, regardless of the size of their down payment.


   Mortgage Title Insurance  

Mortgage title insurance protects against loss in the event a sale is later invalidated because of a problem with the title. Mortgage title insurance protects a beneficiary against losses if it is determined at the time of the sale that someone other than the seller owns the property.



Before mortgage closing, a representative, such as a lawyer or a title company employee, performs a title search. The process is designed to uncover any liens placed on the property that would prevent the owner from selling. A title search also verifies that the real estate being sold belongs to the seller. Despite a thorough search, it isn’t hard to miss important pieces of evidence when information is not centralized.


   Mortgage Protection Life Insurance  

Borrowers are often offered mortgage protection life insurance when they fill out paperwork to start a mortgage. A borrower can decline this insurance when it is offered, but you may be required to sign a series of forms and waivers, verifying your decision. This extra paperwork intends to prove you understand the risks associated with having a mortgage.



Payouts for mortgage life insurance can be either declining-term (the payout drops as the mortgage balance drops) or level, although the latter costs more. The recipient of the payments can be either the lender or the heirs of the borrower, depending on the terms of the policy.




How Long Do I Need To Pay Mortgage Insurance?
If you have a conventional loan, you'll generally need to pay mortgage insurance until you have at least 20% equity in the home. If you have an FHA loan, you'll have to pay mortgage insurance premiums (MIP) until you pay off the mortgage or refinance.




What Does Mortgage Insurance Cover?
Mortgage insurance isn't for your benefit—it's for your lender's. It protects your mortgage company from loss if you wind up unable to make your payments. It won't protect you from losing your house if you default on the loan.




How Can I Avoid Paying Mortgage Insurance?
If you don't want to pay private mortgage insurance when you borrow funds for a new home, you'll need to put down at least 20%. Depending on the lender, you might also be able to avoid PMI by choosing a mortgage with a higher interest rate that compensates the lender for the additional risk. However, some loans, such as FHA loans, will require mortgage insurance premiums regardless of the equity you hold in the home.


   The Bottom Line  

Mortgage insurance protects the lender in the event that you cannot meet your mortgage obligations. Lenders require you to pay for private mortgage insurance if you put down less than 20% on a conventional loan, but you can request to drop the insurance once you have sufficient equity. For government-backed FHA loans, however, you're required to pay mortgage insurance premiums for the life of the loan.
What Is a Mortgage Originator?  

A mortgage originator is an institution or individual that works with a borrower to complete a a home loan transaction. A mortgage originator is the original mortgage lender and can be either a mortgage broker or a mortgage banker. Mortgage originators are part of the primary mortgage market and must work with underwriters and loan processors from the application date until closing to gather the necessary documentation and guide the file through the approval process.





key takeaways

A mortgage originator is an institution or individual that works with an underwriter to complete a home loan transaction for a borrower.Mortgage originators consist of retail banks, mortgage bankers, and mortgage brokers.Since they create loans, mortgage originators are part of the primary mortgage market; but they often quickly sell their loans into the secondary mortgage market.Mortgage originators make money through the fees that are charged to originate a mortgage and the difference between the interest rate given to a borrower and the premium a secondary market will pay for that interest rate.


   Understanding a Mortgage Originator  

The mortgage originator is the first company involved in the creation of a mortgage. Mortgage originators consist of retail banks, mortgage bankers, and mortgage brokers. While banks use their traditional sources of funding to close loans, mortgage bankers typically use what is known as a warehouse line of credit to fund loans. Most banks, and nearly all mortgage bankers, quickly sell newly originated mortgages into the secondary mortgage market.



However, depending on its size and sophistication, a mortgage originator might aggregate mortgages for a certain period of time before selling the whole package; it might also sell individual loans as they are originated. There is risk involved for an originator when it holds onto a mortgage after an interest rate has been quoted and locked in by a borrower. If the mortgage is not simultaneously sold into the secondary market at the time the borrower locks the interest rate, interest rates could change, which changes the value of the mortgage in the secondary market and, ultimately, the profit the originator makes on the mortgage. A mortgage calculator can show you the impact of different rates on your monthly payment.







Originators that aggregate mortgages before selling them often hedge their mortgage pipelines against interest rate shifts. There is a special type of transaction called a best efforts trade, designed for the sale of a single mortgage, which eliminates the need for the originator to hedge a mortgage. Smaller originators tend to use best efforts trades.



In general, mortgage originators make money through the fees that are charged to originate a mortgage and the difference between the interest rate given to a borrower and the premium a secondary market will pay for that interest rate.

   Primary vs. Secondary Mortgage Market  

The primary mortgage market is the initial marketplace where the borrower gets together with the mortgage originator, whether a bank, credit union or mortgage broker, to conduct a mortgage transaction. At the closing table, the primary mortgage lender provides the funds to the borrower, which the borrower uses to complete his home purchase.



The lenders seen above are merely representative of a handful of lenders as the primary mortgage market is highly fragmented in the United States. While there are several large firms that originate a large percentage of mortgages, there are thousands of smaller firms and individuals that also account for a large percentage of total mortgage originations.



Once originated, the servicing rights to mortgages frequently get sold from one institution to another. This activity takes place on the secondary mortgage market, termed as such because buying and selling in this marketplace can only occur after a mortgage is already in force. Government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs) such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac represent some of the largest buyers on the secondary market. Secondary buyers often package pools of loans into mortgage-backed securities (MBS) and sell them, frequently to investment banks on Wall Street.



Tallying up what percentage of originations belong to which mortgage originator depends on how an origination is counted. Since a large percentage of newly originated mortgages are immediately sold into the secondary mortgage market, they might be counted by the institution that purchases the mortgage in the secondary market as an origination, thus double-counting the origination.


   Different Types of Mortgage Originators  

Mortgage bankers and mortgage brokers represent two of the most common types of mortgage originators. While the titles sound similar, important distinctions exist between the two. A mortgage banker works for a lending institution that funds loans at closing with its own money. Most retail banks and credit unions employ mortgage bankers.



A mortgage broker, by contrast, serves as a middleman between the borrower and various mortgage banking institutions. The broker takes the application, checks credit and income, and often handles much of the underwriting and processing but ultimately ferrets the loan out to a lending institution to fund it at closing.
What Is a Mortgage Rate?  

A mortgage rate is the percentage of interest that is charged for a home loan.



Broadly speaking, mortgage rates change with the economic conditions that prevail at any given time. However, the mortgage rate that a home buyer is offered is determined by the lender and depends on the individual's credit history and financial circumstances, among other factors.



The consumer decides whether to apply for a variable mortgage rate or a fixed rate. A variable rate will go up or down with the fluctuations of national borrowing costs, and alters the individual's monthly payment for better or worse. A fixed-rate mortgage remains the same for the life of the mortgage.





Key Takeaways

A mortgage rate is the interest rate charged for a home loan.Mortgage rates can either be fixed at a specific interest rate, or variable, fluctuating with a benchmark interest rate.Potential homebuyers can keep an eye on trends in mortgage rates by watching the prime rate and the 10-year Treasury bond yield.


   Understanding Mortgage Rates  

The prevailing mortgage rate is a primary consideration for homebuyers seeking to purchase a home using a loan. The rate a homebuyer gets has a substantial impact on the amount of the monthly payment that person can afford.



Mortgage rates are highly sensitive to economic conditions. Since 1980, average mortgage rates for a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage have hit a high of 18.3%, during a period of runaway inflation in 1981, and a low of 2.6% in 2020, in the early days of the Covid pandemic. In mid-July 2023, the average national rate was 7.2%.



How much does the interest rate matter? Say you want to buy a house that cost $436,000. That's the nationwide average price as of mid-July 2023. You put $87,200, or 20%, down. You need to finance $348,800. A mortgage calculator makes this easy.



Your monthly payment on a 30-year mortgage would be:



$1,749 at the historic low 2.6% interest rate$2,720 at the mid-2023 average 7.2% interest rate$5,695 at the historic high 18.2% interest rate





Keep an Eye on the Fed

The biggest single factor that determines mortgage rates and all other borrowing rates in the U.S. is the Federal Reserve's decision on the rates it charges banks in order to maintain the stability of the system. All other loan rates are based on these rates, which are set at meetings held every six weeks.


   Mortgage Rate Indicators to Keep an Eye on  

Given their impact on monthly living costs, people who are considering buying a home are wise to keep an eye on the direction of interest rates.



There are a few indicators to follow. The prime rate is one indicator. This rate represents the lowest average rate banks are offering for credit. Banks use the prime rate for interbank lending and may also offer prime rates to their most creditworthy borrowers.



The prime rate tends to follow trends in the Federal Reserve’s federal funds rate. It is usually about 3% higher than the current federal funds rate.



Another indicator for borrowers is the 10-year Treasury bond yield. This yield helps to show market trends in interest rates. If the bond yield rises, mortgage rates typically rise as well. The inverse is the same; if the bond yield drops, mortgage rates will usually also drop.



Even though most mortgages are calculated based on a 30-year timeframe, many mortgages are either paid off or refinanced for a new rate within 10 years. Therefore, the 10-year Treasury bond yield can be an excellent standard to judge. 



And, of course, you can keep an eye on the trends in mortgage rates. Freddie Mac updates mortgage rate changes on its site weekly.


   Determining a Mortgage Rate  

A lender assumes a level of risk when it issues a mortgage, for there is always the possibility a customer may default on the loan.



There are a number of factors that go into determining an individual's mortgage rate, and the higher the risk, the higher the rate. A high rate ensures the lender recoups the initial loan amount at a faster rate in case the borrower defaults, protecting the lender's financial investment.



The borrower's credit score is a key component in assessing the rate charged on a mortgage and the size of the mortgage loan a borrower can obtain. A higher credit score indicates the borrower has a good financial history and is more likely to repay debts. This allows the lender to lower the mortgage rate because the risk of default is deemed to be lower.




Are Mortgage Rates Going Up or Down in 2023?
You and every economist in the country want the answer to this question, but one reliable source is Sam Khater, chief economist for the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp., also known as Freddie Mac.On June 15, 2023, Khater noted that mortgage rates had decreased slightly the previous week in anticipation of a pause in rate hikes by the Federal Reserve. He expects rates to continue to decline into next year."As inflation continues to decelerate, economic growth is slowing and the tightening cycle of monetary policy is reaching its apex, which means mortgage rates are expected to decrease later this year and into next," he said in a statement.




Are Mortgage Rates Bad Right Now?
Depends on your perspective. If you were around in 1980, or even 1990, the average 7.2% rate for mid-July 2023 looks pretty good to you. If you were house-shopping during the Great Recession that followed the 2008-2009 financial meltdown, the current rate looks high.In fact, mortgage rates stayed at a historically low level from the Great Recession through the height of the Covid pandemic.Now, rates have climbed back to a level that might be considered closer to normal.




Is a Fixed-Rate Mortgage or a Variable Rate Mortgage Better?
A fixed-rate mortgage gives you security. Your payment will never go up, no matter what happens to interest rates in the world outside. If rates go down, you can refinance.A variable rate mortgage usually has a slightly lower interest rate to start, keeping your costs low at a time when you might be squeezed for cash. That's because the bank is betting that interest rates will go up, while you're betting they'll go down.If you lose that bet, your monthly payment will go up, and you won't have the option of refinancing until they go down again.


   The Bottom Line  

A mortgage rate is the interest that a home buyer will pay to finance the purchase.



You'll get the best rate available if you have a very good credit rating and a financial history that proves you can afford to repay the loan.



However, the range of mortgage rates that are available at any given time are well outside your control. Prevailing interest rates determine mortgage rates, and they change from week to week depending on economic conditions.
What Is a Mortgage Rate Lock Float Down?  

The term mortgage rate lock float down refers to a financing option that locks in the interest rate on a mortgage with the option to reduce it if market rates fall during the lock period. A typical rate lock provides a borrower with security against an increase during the rate lock period. The float down option specifically allows the borrower to take advantage of a fall in interest rates during the lock period.





Key Takeaways

A mortgage rate lock float down locks in a rate during the underwriting period with the option to reduce it if market interest rates fall during that period.Borrowers are protected against a rate increase while the float down option allows them to take advantage of a rate drop during the lock period.This option comes at a fee—the cost of which depends on the lender.Lenders don't advise borrowers when rates fall, so it's up to borrowers to contact their lender if they want to exercise the float down option.


   How a Mortgage Rate Lock Float Down Works  

A mortgage rate lock float down is a type of mortgage product that offers borrowers both security and flexibility when interest rates fluctuate. The mortgage rate float down allows the borrower to lock in their mortgage rate. But if rates fall during the underwriting process, they can opt into the float down option to have the mortgage processed at the lower rate. This may be a sensible option when mortgage rates fluctuate or if they've been rising and falling over a short period of time.



Borrowers can request to exercise the float down option at any time before the mortgage closes to take advantage of a lower mortgage interest rate. Exercising the float down option may occur as early as one week after the mortgage proceedings get underway, depending on the terms with the lender. The terms should define the time frame that the lock is in place, which could be 30 or 60 days. The time period allows the borrower to take advantage of improved interest rates while the mortgage application is being processed.



Lenders may offer a rate lock float down option to borrowers because they don't want them to shop around or finance their loan with another institution or broker. Ideally, the lender wants the borrower's business over the long term because banks earn the interest on the mortgage minus any costs to the bank to service the mortgage.



The float down option on a rate lock does come at a cost. The borrower pays a fee for the flexibility of the float down option, which could be a few or several hundred dollars depending on the lender. As a result, rate locks with a float down option are more expensive than rate locks without the float down option.


   Special Considerations  

Although they may have the float down option available to them, borrowers don't automatically receive lower rates. This means it's their responsibility to opt into the lower rate as the lender has no obligation to inform the borrower that rates have fallen. The borrower must call the mortgage broker or lender to make the request for the float down option.






Make sure you keep up with mortgage rates as your lender isn't likely to inform you of the right time to exercise your float down option.



Here's another consideration. If rates fall and stabilize, then appear to be at the bottom of the rate cycle, it probably doesn't make sense to pay for the float down option. Borrowers may want to see rates fall enough to more than pay for the fee of the float down option. A drop from 5.10% to 5.00% during the underwriting process probably isn't enough to offset the cost of the float down option. But if there's an expectation that rates will move from 5.10% to 4.60%, the savings over the long term would likely eclipse the fee for the float down, making it a good option.



Refinancing may be an option if rates fall low enough to save money over the long term and enough to cover the closing costs of a new mortgage. Many lenders allow borrowers to refinance as early as six months after the mortgage closes. In other words, if you miss out on the float down and rates fall by a half a percentage point or more, you can always refinance and take advantage of the lower rate.


   Mortgage Rate Lock Float Down vs. Convertible Adjustable-Rate Mortgage (ARM)  

The mortgage rate lock float down starts with the rate lock or with a fixed-rate mortgage, but the borrower can exercise the option to take a lower rate if rates fall. The option to get the lower rate expires typically within 30 to 60 days. A convertible adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM), on the other hand, allows the borrower to take advantage of lower rates for a few years before converting to a fixed-rate mortgage.



An adjustable-rate mortgage begins with a much lower introductory teaser rate, but after a set period—typically three to 10 years—the rate is adjusted according to an index plus a margin. The rate is generally adjusted every six months and can go up or down depending on the terms outlined in the contract.



Convertible ARMs are marketed as a way to take advantage of falling interest rates and usually include specific conditions. The financial institution generally charges a fee to switch the ARM to a fixed-rate mortgage.


   Example of a Mortgage Rate Lock Float Down  

Let's say a borrower finds a home and makes an offer. They are now in the process of underwriting the mortgage before the closing in 30 days. The borrower decides to take advantage of a float-down option because interest rates have fallen over the last few months. Here's what their rate lock float down option may look like:



The rate lock for the mortgage is 4.25% for 30 years.The borrower pays a fee for the option to lower the rate lock on the mortgage.Two weeks later, mortgage rates fall to 3.80%, and the borrower exercises the option for the float down.At the closing, the rate for the mortgage is set at 3.80% for the life of the mortgage. In other words, 3.80% is the fixed rate for the life of the mortgage.
What Is a Mortgage Recast?  

A mortgage recast, also called a loan recast, is a feature of some types of mortgages where remaining monthly payments are recalculated based on a new amortization schedule. During a mortgage recast, the borrower pays a large sum toward their principal, and their mortgage is then recalculated based on the new, lower balance outstanding.



Some mortgages have a scheduled recast date, which is the date when the lender will calculate a new amortization schedule based on the mortgage's remaining principal balance and term.





Key Takeaways

A recast occurs when a borrower pays a large sum toward their mortgage's principal, and the lender recalculates the loan based on the new balance.When the lender recalculates the loan, they will create a new amortization schedule, which is a table of loan payments showing the principal and interest that comprises each payment until the loan is paid in full.The main benefit to the borrower of recasting a mortgage is the opportunity to reduce monthly payments.Negative amortization loans or option adjustable-rate mortgages (option ARM) frequently have a mortgage recast clause as part of the loan contract.


   How a Mortgage Recast Works  

For the borrower, the primary benefit of recasting a mortgage is to reduce monthly payments. Often, a mortgage lender will simply reduce the term of a loan if extra principal payments are made, but maintain the same fixed monthly amount due—simply by increasing the principal amount and reducing the interest portion of the payment.



Recasting can lower the amount of interest the borrower will pay over the life of the loan if a sufficiently large principal payment is made, reducing both the interest and principal remaining on the loan's new monthly payments.


   Mortgage Recast vs. Refinancing  

A mortgage recast can be a more comfortable option than refinancing. With a refinance, you replace your current mortgage with a new mortgage loan, which can be costly and depends on your credit standing. A mortgage recast does not involve a credit check and continues with the original mortgage.



On the other hand, refinancing a mortgage means paying off the existing loan and replacing it with a new one. Reasons why homeowners refinance include:



The opportunity to obtain a lower interest rate.
To shorten the term of their mortgage.
The desire to convert from an adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM) to a fixed-rate mortgage or vice versa.
An opportunity to tap into a home's equity to finance a large purchase.
To consolidate debt.






Unlike refinancing a mortgage, recasting a mortgage will not lower the interest rate on your mortgage.


   Types of Mortgages That May Be Recast  
  Negative Amortization Loans  

Mortgage recasting can be written into the loan terms and is associated with a negative amortization loan. A negatively amortizing loan has a payment structure that allows for a scheduled payment that is less than the loan's interest charge.



When a payment is less than the interest charge at the time, it creates deferred interest. The amount of deferred interest created is added to the principal balance of the loan, leading to a situation where the principal owed increases over time instead of decreasing. Due to this increasing principal, negative amortization mortgages require that the loan is recast at some point so that it will be paid off by the end of its scheduled term. 



Negative amortization mortgages also sometimes have triggers that might cause an unscheduled recast to occur. This may kick in, for example, if the principal balance of the loan reaches a set limit through negative amortization.


  Option Adjustable-Rate Mortgages (Option ARM)  

Negative amortization mortgages are also known as payment option adjustable-rate mortgages (Option ARM). These mortgages give borrowers options that include paying all of the principal and interest or paying only some of the interest.



While the choices available with an option ARM allow for more flexibility on payments, the borrower could easily end up with more long-term debt than before. As with other adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs), there is the possibility of interest rates changing drastically and rapidly based on the market.


   Example of a Mortgage Recast  

Even if a mortgage does not have a recast option included, you can approach your lender to see if a mortgage recast will benefit you and lower your monthly payments. By paying a lump sum and recasting your mortgage, you can reduce your housing costs. By contrast, if you submit a lump sum without recasting, you lower your balance but your monthly payments will remain the same.



Let's say you have a $500,000, 30-year fixed-rate mortgage with a 4% interest rate. Your combined interest and principal payment would be around $2,400 per month in terms of principal and interest.



After tend years, you receive a windfall lump sum of $375,000. If you decided to use that lump sum to pay down the mortgage without recasting it, you would continue to pay around $2,400 a month, but the length of the loan would become shorter as you are effectively paying down additional principal.



If, on the other hand, you recast the loan over the remaining 25 years of the mortgage, the monthly payment would go down to around $900 per month in terms of principal and interest.







Correction—April 13, 2022: A prior version of this article incorrectly calculated the recast monthly mortgage payment amount in the example.
What Are Mortgage Servicing Rights (MSR)?  

Mortgage servicing rights (MSR) refer to a contractual agreement in which the right to service an existing mortgage is sold by the original mortgage lender to another party that specializes in the various functions involved with servicing mortgages.





Key Takeaways

Mortgage servicing rights are sold by the originator of a mortgage to another financial institution, which then takes over the administration of the mortgage, which includes such tasks as collecting payments and forwarding them to the originator.The original lender pays the servicer a fee for performing this work.Nothing changes for the mortgagor except the address to which payments are sent.


   Understanding Mortgage Servicing Rights (MSR)  

MSRs have ongoing administrative duties that are regularly processed for the entire length of a mortgage. Common rights included are the right to collect mortgage payments monthly, set aside taxes and insurance premiums in escrow, and forward the interest and principal portions to the mortgage lender. In return the servicer is compensated with a specific fee, which is outlined in the contract that has been established and entered into at the beginning of the servicing agreement.



The mortgage payment amount, interest rate, type of loan, and other factors remain the same. As far as the borrower is concerned, only the address to which payments are sent is changed, and you should contact the servicer, rather than your original mortgage lender, with any questions you may have regarding your loan. Your servicer can change at any time, but you should receive notice from your original lender at least 15 days before it happens, and your new servicer should notify you within 15 days of assuming rights as well.






Federal banking laws let financial institutions sell mortgages or transfer servicing rights to other institutions without consumer consent.﻿﻿


   Example of Selling an MSR  

Sarah takes out a $500,000 mortgage from Lender A. She sends the lender a monthly payment of principal and interest. Three years later Lender A decides to transfer its MSR on Sarah’s mortgage to Company B. Under the terms of the contract, Company B is paid a fee by Lender A for processing all of Sarah’s remaining mortgage payments. The mortgage lender can then spend more time and money providing new mortgages while the company assuming the MSR forwards the mortgage payments to the lender.


   Special Considerations  

A lender will often sell MSRs as a means of freeing up lines of credit for lending money to additional borrowers. The majority of mortgages are in effect for 15 to 30 years, and the bank needs billions of dollars to lend money to other consumers requesting mortgages during this time. Because the term is so long, it is important to do thorough research among the best mortgage lenders.



In a roundabout way, selling MSRs means that more people can become homeowners because the sale of these rights produces revenue.



Lenders also make money by charging fees for originating mortgages and earning monthly interest from payments. Mortgages are simply additional assets that bring in more revenue for banks.


   History of MSRs  

The market for MSRs tends to be strong during periods of economic growth, due to higher quality mortgage originations and fewer defaults. Hedge funds, banks, and real estate investment trusts (REITs) find these assets attractive because MSRs can yield high amounts of interest. For example, SunTrust purchased $8 billion in MSRs in the first quarter of 2016 as a means of earning a solid return on investment (ROI), and within months its MSR portfolio contained $1.123 billion in unpaid principal balances of loans that the bank was servicing for lenders.



National Mortgage News reported in June 2019 that MSRs "have been one of the best-performing fixed-income asset classes over the past five years." However, it also reported that "since October 2018, as medium- and long-term interest rates have fallen, projected and actual mortgage prepayment assumptions have accelerated, causing the expected average life of MSRs to shorten considerably."



This has resulted in the fact that "MSR values from April to May were down consistently (by a half) multiple." That said, reports National Mortgage News, "the demand from MSR buyers is still very strong, and there is general consensus around MSR values."




What Is Mortgage Excess Servicing?
Mortgage excess servicing is a fee based on the excess cash flow after a basket of loans are pooled together and securitized. This is paid out to mortgage services as a fee to maintain a mortgage-backed security.




Why Do Banks Sell Mortgage Servicing Rights?
Banks sell mortgage servicing rights as a way to free up lines of credit. This allows them to lend out more money, ultimately helping more people afford properties.




How Do You Value Mortgage Servicing Rights?
According to the Federal Housing Financing Agency(FHFA), the value of a mortgage servicing right is determined by the discounted present value of future cash flows, adjusted for the expected amount of prepayments.


   The Bottom Line  

Mortgage Servicing Rights, or MSRs, give someone the ability to purchase the cash flow from someone's mortgage, even if that person is not the original mortgage lender. Banks and lenders will sell MSRs in order to free up capital, thereby allowing them to originate more loans. Nothing changes for the borrower, except the address where they direct their payments.
What Is a Mortgagee?  

A mortgagee is a lender: specifically, an entity that lends money to a borrower for the purpose of purchasing real estate. In a mortgage transaction, the lender serves as the mortgagee and the borrower is known as the mortgagor.





key takeaways

A mortgagee is an entity that lends money to a borrower (also known as a mortgagor) for the purpose of purchasing real estate.In order to limit its risk, a mortgagee creates a priority legal interest in the value of the mortgaged property, allowing it to seize it if the mortgagor defaults on the loan.


   How a Mortgagee Works  

Most people take out a mortgage to finance the purchase of a residence or commercial building. In order to limit its risk in the investment, the lender in the transaction creates a priority legal interest in the value of the property, substantially lowering the probability it, the mortgagee, will not be repaid in full if the borrower defaults on the loan. This is done through a perfected lien and title ownership.



A mortgagee represents the interests of the lending financial institution in a mortgage deal. Lending institutions can offer a variety of products to borrowers, representing a significant portion of loan assets for both individual lenders and the credit market overall.


   Mortgage Lending Products  

Mortgagees can structure mortgage loans with either a fixed rate of interest or a variable rate of interest. Most mortgage loans follow an amortization schedule that provides for steady monthly cash flow to the lending institution in the form of installment payments until the loan is paid off at the end of its term. Standard fixed-rate installment mortgage loans are generally the most common type of mortgage loan issued by lenders. Adjustable rate mortgage loans can also be offered as a variable rate mortgage product.



Lenders can also issue non-amortizing loans. However, these products are not typically qualified mortgages and carry much higher risk. Non-amortizing loans may have either fixed or variable rates. They are loans that defer principal cash flows for the borrower to one lump sum payment. During the duration of the loan interest payments may or may not be required. Popular types of non-amortizing mortgage loans are balloon payments loans and interest-only loans.






Mortgage loans are one of the most popular types of secured loans in the credit market.


   Protections for Mortgagees  

In a mortgage loan, the mortgagee has rights to the real estate collateral associated with the loan. This provides the lender with protections against default. However, it also requires certain provisions to be made for the seizing of collateral assets if default occurs. For this reason, mortgagees include a perfected lien and integrate title rights into a mortgage lending contract.



A perfected lien is drafted by a lender’s legal counsel to allow for a mortgagee to easily obtain the real estate associated with a mortgage loan if the mortgagor defaults. A perfected lien is a lien that has been filed and recorded with the appropriate agency giving the mortgagee rights to more easily obtain the real estate collateral. In a secured mortgage loan, the mortgagee is also the named real estate property owner on the property’s title. With the lien and property title, a mortgagee can easily obtain legal rights and institute specific procedures for vacating a property to be taken over in foreclosure.
What is a Mortgagor  

A mortgagor is that who borrows money from a lender in order to purchase a home or other piece of real estate. Mortgagors can obtain mortgage loans with varying terms based on their credit profile and collateral. In a mortgage loan the mortgagor must pledge the title to the real property as collateral for the loan.



This can be contrasted with a mortgagee, who is the entity that lends money to a borrower for the purpose of purchasing real estate.





Key Takeaways

A mortgagor is the person or other entity that receives a mortgage loan in order to buy property.Before obtaining a loan, a mortgagor must complete an application and be approved by the lender's underwriters.Once the loan has been funded, the mortgagor is responsible for making timely payments of interest and principal. If they do not, they may ultimately be subject to foreclosure on the home.


   Understanding Mortgagors  

Mortgagors can obtain varying mortgage loan terms based on underwriting factors associated with a mortgage loan. Mortgage loans are a type of secured loan therefore one commonality among all mortgage loans is the pledging of real estate collateral.



In a mortgage loan the mortgagor is the party receiving the loan and the mortgagee is the party offering the loan. The mortgagor must submit a credit application and agree to the mortgage loan terms if approved for a loan. The mortgagee has the authority to determine the terms of the mortgage loan, oversee the servicing of the loan and manage the title rights to the real estate collateral.


   Applying for a Mortgage Loan  

Similar to other types of loans in the credit market, the terms of a mortgage loan will be based on the borrower’s credit application and the lenders underwriting standards. Mortgage loan underwriting will focus on a borrower’s credit score, credit history and debt-to income levels. However, different from other types of loans, a mortgage loan will also closely consider a borrower’s housing expense ratio. Underwriters analyze these three components when assessing a mortgagor for mortgage loan approval. They also use a mortgagor’s housing expense ratio to determine the maximum amount issued with the loan. Lenders have varying standards for mortgage loan approvals. Generally traditional lenders will require a credit score of 620 or higher, a debt-to-income level of 36% and a housing expense ratio of 28%.﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿ Housing expenses included in the housing expense ratio can vary by lender with the key component being the mortgagor’s monthly mortgage payment.﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿


   Mortgage Loan Contract Obligations  

Mortgagors approved for a mortgage loan must agree to the terms offered by the mortgagee in order to complete the deal. A mortgage loan contract will include the mortgagor’s interest rate and duration. The mortgagor is required to make monthly payments of principal and interest in order to keep the loan in good standing with the mortgagee. Mortgage loan contracts also include provisions for title ownership and a lien on the real estate property as collateral. Provisions pertaining to the collateral outline the requirements for maintaining monthly payments and the specifications regarding any missed payments. Terms can vary regarding the number of delinquent payments allowed and when the lender can take action with the lien to seize the property in default.
What Is the Mosaic Theory?  

The mosaic theory refers to a method of analysis used by security analysts to gather information about a corporation. The mosaic theory involves collecting public, non-public, and non-material information about a company to determine the underlying value of its securities and to enable the analyst to make recommendations to clients based on that information.





Key Takeaways

The mosaic theory is a style of financial research in which the analyst uses a variety of resources to determine the value of a company, stock or other security.The mosaic theory necessitates that the analyst gathers public, non-public, and non-material information about a company.This wide range of information is used to help the analyst determine the company's stock value and whether the stock should be recommended to clients.


   How the Mosaic Theory Works  

There is an ongoing debate within the investment community as to whether this style of analysis misuses insider information, but the CFA Institute, formerly known as the Association for Investment Management and Research (AIMR), has recognized mosaic theory as a valid method of analysis.



Hedge fund manager Raj Rajaratnam used the mosaic theory as his defense during his insider trading trial in 2011 but was ultimately found guilty.






Analysts using mosaic theory should disclose to clients the details of the information and methodology they used to arrive at their recommendation; this protocol increases transparency and helps avoid accusations of misuse of inside information.


   Mosaic Theory vs. Scuttlebutt Method  

Mosaic theory closely aligns with the scuttlebutt method, a company analysis technique popularized by investment guru Philip Fisher in his 1958 book “Common Stocks and Uncommon Profits."



Investors who use the scuttlebutt method make conclusions about a company by piecing information together using firsthand knowledge from discussions with employees, competitors and industry experts. Both the mosaic theory and the scuttlebutt method gather small pieces of non-material information and add them together to form a material conclusion.


   Special Considerations  

Easier access to information makes the mosaic theory more accessible to do-it-yourself (DIY) investors. Non-material information might be collected in the following ways.


  10-K Reports  

Investors who have a proficient understanding of accounting concepts, such as profit and loss statements and balance sheets, can scour the company’s financial performance for anomalies. You can access 10-K reports on the Securities and Exchange Commission’s (SEC) website.


  LinkedIn and Glassdoor  

These websites provide useful insight into a company’s employees from customer service representatives to senior management. Investors might be able to make conclusions about the labor turnover rate and level of employee satisfaction by reviewing user profiles and posted content.


  Google Trends  

Determine if there is robust consumer demand for a company’s products and services by using this Google research tool. For example, an investor may conclude that a company is likely to receive a takeover bid from a multinational corporation due to strong demand for a new product it sells in a foreign market.


  The Pew Research Center  

This site provides investors with nonpartisan macro insights about current trends, attitudes, and issues that are shaping the world. For instance, Investors might learn that a company is majorly out of alignment with public sentiment about a particular issue, which may severely impact its revenue.
What Is the Most-Favored-Nation Clause?  

A most-favored-nation (MFN) clause requires a country providing a trade concession to one trading partner to extend the same treatment to all. Used in trade treaties for hundreds of years, the MFN clause and its principle of universal equal treatment underpin the World Trade Organization.



In U.S. trade legislation, most-favored-nation treatment is now described as "permanent normal trade relations" to avoid the implication it confers preferential status.



With the advent of the NAFTA regional trade bloc (and its successor treaty known in the U.S. as USMCA), most-favored-nation has been used to describe the status of non-qualifying imports subject to tariffs. The term has spread to commercial law, where it is used to denote the requirement of equal treatment for all customers.





Key Takeaways


The most-favored-nation clause requires a country to extend the same trade terms to all trading partners.
The MFN clause is the founding principle of the World Trade Organization, with notable exceptions under WTO rules.
The U.S. denies MFN trade status only to Cuba and North Korea
The loss of MFN status exposes a country to discriminatory import tariffs on its products



   Most-Favored-Nation Clause Explained  

In international trade, MFN treatment is synonymous with non-discriminatory trade policy. For example, if a country belonging to the WTO reduces or eliminates a tariff on a particular product for one trading partner, the treaty's MFN clause obligates it to extend the same treatment to all members of the organization.



Note that there is no requirement under MFN that the trade concession be reciprocal: countries benefiting from a lower tariff are not required to automatically drop theirs in return (though that can certainly happen under trade agreements).



The WTO provides the following exemptions from MFN provisions for the following:



trade blocs like the USMCA and the European Union, which are allowed to discriminate against imports from outside the bloc
trade barriers in response to unfair competition
for trade preferences extended to developing countries
for trade in services, on a limited basis






The World Trade Organization's MFN clause allows regional trade blocs like the European Union and NAFTA successor USMCA to discriminate against imports from outside the bloc when setting tariffs.


   Evolution of the MFN Clause in U.S. Trade Policy  

In the U.S., the Jackson-Vanik amendment to the Trade Act of 1974 denied the trade benefits of most-favored-nation status to non-market economies restricting emigration. Initially applied to the Soviet Union, China and Vietnam, among others, the Jackson-Vanik amendment was repealed for China in 2002 and Vietnam in 2006. In 2012, the Magnitsky Act repealed the Jackson-Vanik amendment as it applied to Russia, normalizing U.S.-Russia trade relations.



The Jackson-Vanik amendment remains in force, subject to annual presidential waiver, for Azerbaijan, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, and Turkmenistan.



The only countries currently ineligible for normal trade relations, or most favored nation, U.S. import duty rates are Cuba and North Korea, which remain subject to a U.S. embargo.



In September 2020, a World Trade Organization panel ruled the Trump administration violated WTO rules by imposing discriminatory import tariffs on $200 billion of Chinese goods.


   Most-Favored-Nation Benefits and Drawbacks  

In global trade, the non-discriminatory principle enshrined in the most-favored-nation clause extends the benefits of trade liberalization measures as widely as possible, while protecting smaller exporters against preferential terms secured by larger ones.



In practice, the WTO enforcement mechanism can only authorize that an injured party, not the organization collectively, impose retaliatory tariffs when discriminated against. That leaves smaller countries depending on larger ones to comply with rulings voluntarily.



Some have suggested the WTO's ineffective enforcement mechanism actually helps shield countries that violate MFN principles from punishment.



The proliferation of regional trade blocs and unilateral sanctions for "unfair trade" have also eroded the principle of universality enshrined in the most-favored-nation clause.



In December 2019, the Trump administration sidelined the WTO's appellate body by blocking all appointments to the seven-member panel. It claimed the panel had overstepped its mandate. In October 2021, the Biden administration's nominee to the WTO appeals panel said she would work to restore WTO rules enforcement.


   The Cost of Losing Most-Favored-Nation Status  

In March 2022, the Congressional Research Service said the loss of permanent normal trade relations status by Russia as a result of Western sanctions would raise import duties on Russian titanium products exports to the U.S. from 15% to 45%, costing U.S. importers an additional $32.4 million based on 2021 trade value.
What Is Mothballing?  

Mothballing is the deactivation and preservation of equipment or a production facility for possible future use or sale. It can also mean the setting aside of an object or idea for possible reuse or revisiting in the future. Mothballing is common with expensive capital goods, machinery, aircraft, ships, properties, and other assets that are costly to create, have long useful lives, and may be subject to unpredictable market disruptions.





Key Takeaways

Mothballing refers to the deactivation, storing, and preservation of equipment or production facilities for later use or sale.Common items in business that are mothballed include aircraft, ships, oil rigs, and machinery.Manufacturers can reduce operating costs and manage market downturns with the flexibility that mothballing provides.


   How Mothballing Works  

The term "mothballing" is derived from the use of pesticides to prevent damage to clothing or other goods that are stored for a long time and may be subject to damage from moths or moth larvae. Mothballing can offer production flexibility to manufacturers that have high operating costs, as it allows them to quickly re-open a factory to produce goods based on temporary spikes in demand instead of keeping a factory open on a continual basis at a potentially lower margin.



In production plant assets, mothballing requires considerable planning to ensure that production can resume quickly. Mothballing may lead to assets being put back into use, their updating and refurbishment, disassembly for resale and reuse of their parts, or outright scrapping for their salvage value (steel, aluminum, and other valuable metals).



Mothballing is often neglected when companies are under financial duress. During the Great Recession, companies frequently shut down plants simply by removing dangerous materials and other hazards and then locking the doors, leaving expensive and sensitive equipment to deteriorate. In short order, much equipment had become scrap. If work had been done to deactivate and properly mothball equipment much of their value could have been preserved for later use or sale.


   Mothballing Tips  

Think for the long term; chances are a market dislocation won't last forever.Set aside money for mothballing.Appoint a person to be in charge of mothballing and to create a strategy for executing it.Maintain permits.Handle hazardous materials early on; cleanup later will be far more expensive.Enlist experienced workers (operators and mechanics) to assist with mothballing.Keep good records of what was done and what is maintained and when.


   Example of Mothballing  

A cyclical business that benefits from proper mothballing is oil exploration and drilling. Well-drilling equipment is expensive and oil prices have proven to be unpredictable, not to mention the boom/bust nature of the oil business. When prices fall, wells in some locations may become unprofitable and the demand for new wells will fall. That equates to lots of idle drilling rigs. Properly mothballed rigs can allow drillers to go back to work once a cycle has turned in their favor. The difference in restarting a properly mothballed rig vs. an inadequately mothballed rig can be three or more times the replacement cost.



One of the most common uses of mothballing involves aircraft (commercial and military). Such mothballing, or long-term storage awaiting possible future use, happens at aircraft boneyards or graveyards. Mothballing is also common with seagoing vessels, which are stored and maintained as "ghost fleets" for possible reconditioning, updating, and recommissioning. The cyclical nature of the shipping business, the unpredictability of energy prices, as well as the tight margins of the airline business, means that mothballing these assets is common.
What Is a Moving Average (MA)?  

In finance, a moving average (MA) is a stock indicator commonly used in technical analysis. The reason for calculating the moving average of a stock is to help smooth out the price data by creating a constantly updated average price.



By calculating the moving average, the impacts of random, short-term fluctuations on the price of a stock over a specified time frame are mitigated. Simple moving averages (SMAs) use a simple arithmetic average of prices over some timespan, while exponential moving averages (EMAs) place greater weight on more recent prices than older ones over the time period.





Key Takeaways

A moving average (MA) is a stock indicator commonly used in technical analysis.The moving average helps to level the price data over a specified period by creating a constantly updated average price.A simple moving average (SMA) is a calculation that takes the arithmetic mean of a given set of prices over a specific number of days in the past.An exponential moving average (EMA) is a weighted average that gives greater importance to the price of a stock in more recent days, making it an indicator that is more responsive to new information.












Investopedia / Yurle Villegas


   Understanding a Moving Average (MA)  

Moving averages are calculated to identify the trend direction of a stock or to determine its support and resistance levels. It is a trend-following or lagging, indicator because it is based on past prices.



The longer the period for the moving average, the greater the lag. A 200-day moving average will have a much greater degree of lag than a 20-day MA because it contains prices for the past 200 days. 50-day and 200-day moving average figures are widely followed by investors and traders and are considered to be important trading signals.



Investors may choose different periods of varying lengths to calculate moving averages based on their trading objectives. Shorter moving averages are typically used for short-term trading, while longer-term moving averages are more suited for long-term investors.



While it is impossible to predict the future movement of a specific stock, using technical analysis and research can help make better predictions. A rising moving average indicates that the security is in an uptrend, while a declining moving average indicates that it is in a downtrend.



Similarly, upward momentum is confirmed with a bullish crossover, which occurs when a short-term moving average crosses above a longer-term moving average. Conversely, downward momentum is confirmed with a bearish crossover, which occurs when a short-term moving average crosses below a longer-term moving average.


   Types of Moving Averages  
  Simple Moving Average  

A simple moving average (SMA), is calculated by taking the arithmetic mean of a given set of values over a specified period. A set of numbers, or prices of stocks, are added together and then divided by the number of prices in the set. The formula for calculating the simple moving average of a security is as follows:

  Exponential Moving Average (EMA)  

The exponential moving average gives more weight to recent prices in an attempt to make them more responsive to new information. To calculate an EMA, the simple moving average (SMA) over a particular period is calculated first.



Then calculate the multiplier for weighting the EMA, known as the "smoothing factor," which typically follows the formula: [2/(selected time period + 1)]. 



For a 20-day moving average, the multiplier would be [2/(20+1)]= 0.0952. The smoothing factor is combined with the previous EMA to arrive at the current value. The EMA thus gives a higher weighting to recent prices, while the SMA assigns an equal weighting to all values.

   Simple Moving Average (SMA) vs. Exponential Moving Average (EMA)  

The calculation for EMA puts more emphasis on the recent data points. Because of this, EMA is considered a weighted average calculation.



In the figure below, the number of periods used in each average is 15, but the EMA responds more quickly to the changing prices than the SMA. The EMA has a higher value when the price is rising than the SMA and it falls faster than the SMA when the price is declining. This responsiveness to price changes is the main reason why some traders prefer to use the EMA over the SMA.

   Example of a Moving Average  

The moving average is calculated differently depending on the type: SMA or EMA. Below, we look at a simple moving average (SMA) of a security with the following closing prices over 15 days:



Week 1 (5 days): 20, 22, 24, 25, 23Week 2 (5 days): 26, 28, 26, 29, 27Week 3 (5 days): 28, 30, 27, 29, 28



A 10-day moving average would average out the closing prices for the first 10 days as the first data point. The next data point would drop the earliest price, add the price on day 11 and take the average.


  Example of a Moving Average Indicator  

A Bollinger Band® technical indicator has bands generally placed two standard deviations away from a simple moving average. In general, a move toward the upper band suggests the asset is becoming overbought, while a move close to the lower band suggests the asset is becoming oversold. Since standard deviation is used as a statistical measure of volatility, this indicator adjusts itself to market conditions.




What Does a Moving Average Indicate?
A moving average is a statistic that captures the average change in a data series over time. In finance, moving averages are often used by technical analysts to keep track of price trends for specific securities. An upward trend in a moving average might signify an upswing in the price or momentum of a security, while a downward trend would be seen as a sign of decline.




What Are Moving Averages Used for?
Moving averages are widely used in technical analysis, a branch of investing that seeks to understand and profit from the price movement patterns of securities and indices. Generally, technical analysts will use moving averages to detect whether a change in momentum is occurring for a security, such as if there is a sudden downward move in a security’s price. Other times, they will use moving averages to confirm their suspicions that a change might be underway.




What Are Some Examples of Moving Averages?
The exponential moving average (EMA) is a type of moving average that gives more weight to more recent trading days. This type of moving average might be more useful for short-term traders for whom longer-term historical data might be less relevant. A simple moving average is calculated by averaging a series of prices while giving equal weight to each of the prices involved.




What Is MACD?
The moving average convergence divergence (MACD) is used by traders to monitor the relationship between two moving averages, calculated by subtracting a 26-day exponential moving average from a 12-day exponential moving average. The MACD also employs a signal line that helps identify crossovers, and which itself is a nine-day exponential moving average of the MACD line that is plotted on the same graph. The signal line is used to help identify trend changes in the price of a security and to confirm the strength of a trend. When the MACD is positive, the short-term average is located above the long-term average and is an indication of upward momentum. When the short-term average is below the long-term average, it's a sign that the momentum is downward.




What Is a Golden Cross?
A golden cross is a chart pattern in which a short-term moving average crosses above a long-term moving average. The golden cross is a bullish breakout pattern formed from a crossover involving a security's short-term moving average such as the 15-day moving average, breaking above its long-term moving average, such as the 50-day moving average. As long-term indicators carry more weight, the golden cross indicates a bull market on the horizon and is reinforced by high trading volumes.


   The Bottom Line  

A moving average (MA) is a stock indicator commonly used in technical analysis, used to help smooth out price data by creating a constantly updated average price. A rising moving average indicates that the security is in an uptrend, while a declining moving average indicates a downtrend. The exponential moving average is generally preferred to a simple moving average as it gives more weight to recent prices and shows a clearer response to new information and trends.
What Is Moving Average Convergence/Divergence (MACD)?  

Moving average convergence/divergence (MACD, or MAC-D) is a trend-following momentum indicator that shows the relationship between two exponential moving averages (EMAs) of a security’s price. The MACD line is calculated by subtracting the 26-period EMA from the 12-period EMA.



The result of that calculation is the MACD line. A nine-day EMA of the MACD line is called the signal line, which is then plotted on top of the MACD line, which can function as a trigger for buy or sell signals. Traders may buy the security when the MACD line crosses above the signal line and sell—or short—the security when the MACD line crosses below the signal line. MACD indicators can be interpreted in several ways, but the more common methods are crossovers, divergences, and rapid rises/falls.





Key Takeaways

The moving average convergence/divergence (MACD, or MAC-D) line is calculated by subtracting the 26-period exponential moving average (EMA) from the 12-period EMA. The signal line is a nine-period EMA of the MACD line.MACD is best used with daily periods, where the traditional settings of 26/12/9 days is the default.MACD triggers technical signals when the MACD line crosses above the signal line (to buy) or falls below it (to sell).MACD can help gauge whether a security is overbought or oversold, alerting traders to the strength of a directional move, and warning of a potential price reversal.MACD can also alert investors to bullish/bearish divergences (e.g., when a new high in price is not confirmed by a new high in MACD, and vice versa), suggesting a potential failure and reversal.After a signal line crossover, it is recommended to wait for three or four days to confirm that it is not a false move.

\text{MACD}=\text{12-Period EMA }-\text{ 26-Period EMA}


MACD=12-Period EMA − 26-Period EMA



MACD is calculated by subtracting the long-term EMA (26 periods) from the short-term EMA (12 periods). An EMA is a type of moving average (MA) that places a greater weight and significance on the most recent data points.



The exponential moving average is also referred to as the exponentially weighted moving average. An exponentially weighted moving average reacts more significantly to recent price changes than a simple moving average (SMA), which applies an equal weight to all observations in the period.






   Learning from MACD  

MACD has a positive value (shown as the blue line in the lower chart) whenever the 12-period EMA (indicated by the red line on the price chart) is above the 26-period EMA (the blue line in the price chart) and a negative value when the 12-period EMA is below the 26-period EMA. The level of distance that MACD is above or below its baseline indicates that the distance between the two EMAs is growing.



In the following chart, you can see how the two EMAs applied to the price chart correspond to the MACD (blue) crossing above or below its baseline (red dashed) in the indicator below the price chart.

MACD is often displayed with a histogram (see the chart below) that graphs the distance between MACD and its signal line. If MACD is above the signal line, the histogram will be above the MACD’s baseline, or zero line. If MACD is below its signal line, the histogram will be below the MACD’s baseline. Traders use the MACD’s histogram to identify when bullish or bearish momentum is high—and possibly for overbought/oversold signals.

   MACD vs. Relative Strength  

The relative strength index (RSI) aims to signal whether a market is considered to be overbought or oversold in relation to recent price levels. The RSI is an oscillator that calculates average price gains and losses over a given period of time. The default time period is 14 periods with values bounded from 0 to 100. A reading above 70 suggests an overbought condition, while a reading below 30 is considered oversold, with both potentially signaling a top is forming, or vice versa (a bottom is forming).



The MACD lines, however, do not have concrete overbought/oversold levels like the RSI and other oscillator studies. Rather, they function on a relative basis. That’s to say an investor or trader should focus on the level and direction of the MACD/signal lines compared with preceding price movements in the security at hand, as shown below.













MACD measures the relationship between two EMAs, while the RSI measures price change in relation to recent price highs and lows. These two indicators are often used together to give analysts a more complete technical picture of a market.



These indicators both measure momentum in a market, but because they measure different factors, they sometimes give contrary indications. For example, the RSI may show a reading above 70 (overbought) for a sustained period of time, indicating a market is overextended to the buy side in relation to recent prices, while the MACD indicates that the market is still increasing in buying momentum. Either indicator may signal an upcoming trend change by showing divergence from price (price continues higher while the indicator turns lower, or vice versa).


   Limitations of MACD and Confirmation  

One of the main problems with a moving average divergence is that it can often signal a possible reversal, but then no actual reversal happens—it produces a false positive. The other problem is that divergence doesn’t forecast all reversals. In other words, it predicts too many reversals that don’t occur and not enough real price reversals.



This suggests confirmation should be sought by trend-following indicators, such as the Directional Movement Index (DMI) system and its key component, the Average Directional Index (ADX). The ADX is designed to indicate whether a trend is in place or not, with a reading above 25 indicating a trend is in place (in either direction) and a reading below 20 suggesting no trend is in place.



Investors following MACD crossovers and divergences should double-check with the ADX before making a trade on an MACD signal. For example, while MACD may be showing a bearish divergence, a check of the ADX may tell you that a trend higher is in place—in which case you would avoid the bearish MACD trade signal and wait to see how the market develops over the next few days.



On the other hand, if MACD is showing a bearish crossover and the ADX is in non-trending territory (<25) and has likely shown a peak and reversal on its own, you could have good cause to take the bearish trade.



Furthermore, false positive divergences often occur when the price of an asset moves sideways in a consolidation, such as in a range or triangle pattern following a trend. A slowdown in the momentum—sideways movement or slow trending movement—of the price will cause MACD to pull away from its prior extremes and gravitate toward the zero lines even in the absence of a true reversal. Again, double-check the ADX to determine whether a trend is in place and also look at what price is doing before acting.


   Example of MACD Crossovers  

As shown on the following chart, when MACD falls below the signal line, it is a bearish signal indicating that it may be time to sell. Conversely, when MACD rises above the signal line, the signal is bullish, suggesting that the price of the asset might experience upward momentum. Some traders wait for a confirmed cross above the signal line before entering a position to reduce the chances of being faked out and entering a position too early.



Crossovers are more reliable when they conform to the prevailing trend. If MACD crosses above its signal line after a brief downside correction within a longer-term uptrend, it qualifies as a bullish confirmation and the likely continuation of the uptrend.

If MACD crosses below its signal line following a brief move higher within a longer-term downtrend, traders would consider that a bearish confirmation.












Image by Sabrina Jiang © Investopedia 2022


   Example of Divergence  

When MACD forms highs or lows that that exceed the corresponding highs and lows on the price, it is called a divergence. A bullish divergence appears when MACD forms two rising lows that correspond with two falling lows on the price. This is a valid bullish signal when the long-term trend is still positive.



Some traders will look for bullish divergences even when the long-term trend is negative because they can signal a change in the trend, although this technique is less reliable.












Image by Sabrina Jiang © Investopedia 2022



When MACD forms a series of two falling highs that correspond with two rising highs on the price, a bearish divergence has been formed. A bearish divergence that appears during a long-term bearish trend is considered confirmation that the trend is likely to continue.



Some traders will watch for bearish divergences during long-term bullish trends because they can signal weakness in the trend. However, it is not as reliable as a bearish divergence during a bearish trend.












Image by Sabrina Jiang © Investopedia 2022


   Example of Rapid Rises or Falls  

When MACD rises or falls rapidly (the shorter-term moving average pulls away from the longer-term moving average), it is a signal that the security is overbought or oversold and will soon return to normal levels. Traders will often combine this analysis with the RSI or other technical indicators to verify overbought or oversold conditions.












Image by Sabrina Jiang © Investopedia 2022



It is not uncommon for investors to use the MACD’s histogram the same way that they may use the MACD itself. Positive or negative crossovers, divergences, and rapid rises or falls can be identified on the histogram as well. Some experience is needed before deciding which is best in any given situation, because there are timing differences between signals on the MACD and its histogram.




How do traders use moving average convergence/divergence (MACD)?
Traders use MACD to identify changes in the direction or strength of a stock’s price trend. MACD can seem complicated at first glance because it relies on additional statistical concepts such as the exponential moving average (EMA). But fundamentally, MACD helps traders detect when the recent momentum in a stock’s price may signal a change in its underlying trend. This can help traders decide when to enter, add to, or exit a position.




Is MACD a leading indicator or a lagging indicator?
MACD is a lagging indicator. After all, all the data used in MACD is based on the historical price action of the stock. Because it is based on historical data, it must necessarily lag the price. However, some traders use MACD histograms to predict when a change in trend will occur. For these traders, this aspect of MACD might be viewed as a leading indicator of future trend changes.




What is a MACD bullish/bearish divergence?
A MACD positive (or bullish) divergence is a situation in which MACD does not reach a new low, despite the fact that the price of the stock has reached a new low. This is seen as a bullish trading signal—hence, the term “positive/bullish divergence.” If the opposite scenario occurs—the stock price reaches a new high, but MACD fails to do so—this would be seen as a bearish indicator and termed “negative/bearish divergence.” In both cases, the setups suggest that the move higher/lower will not last, so it is important to look at other technical studies, like the relative strength index (RSI) discussed above.


   The Bottom Line  

MACD is a valuable tool of the moving-average type, best used with daily data. Just as a crossover of the nine- and 14-day SMAs may generate a trading signal for some traders, a crossover of the MACD above or below its signal line may also generate a directional signal.



MACD is based on EMAs (more weight is placed on the most recent data), which means that it can react very quickly to changes of direction in the current price move. But that quickness can also be a two-edged sword. Crossovers of MACD lines should be noted, but confirmation should be sought from other technical signals, such as the RSI, or perhaps a few candlestick price charts. Further, because it is a lagging indicator, it argues that confirmation in subsequent price action should develop before taking the signal.
What Is the MSCI All Country World Index?  

The MSCI All Country World Index (ACWI) is a stock index designed to track broad global equity-market performance. Maintained by Morgan Stanley Capital International (MSCI), the index comprises the stocks of nearly 3,000 companies from 23 developed countries and 25 emerging markets.



Fund managers use the MSCI ACWI as a guide for asset allocation and a benchmark for the performance of global equity funds. The index is also used as the basis for creating investment products such as exchange-traded funds (ETFs).





Key Takeaways

The MSCI ACWI is a stock index that tracks nearly 3,000 stocks in 48 developed and emerging market countries.The components of the MSCI ACWI index have a combined market capitalization of more than $70 trillion.The MSCI ACWI index is used as a benchmark for global equity funds and as a guide to asset allocation.Individual investors can gain access to the index through ETFs that replicate its performance.


   Understanding the MSCI All Country World Index  

Investors can diversify their portfolio holdings in a number of ways. A portfolio manager or investor can purchase a range of individual stocks that have a low or negative correlation with each other.



On the other hand, a less costly and more efficient way to invest might be to own ETFs that replicate the performance of an index such as the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) or the S&P 500 index. For investors that also want to have exposure to global stocks, the MSCI ACWI index can be a good option.



Institutional investors, including those who manage mutual funds and pension funds, can use the MSCI ACWI as a benchmark to measure the performance of their portfolios and a guide to geographical diversification. Individual investors can also use the ACWI as a benchmark to compare which funds have the best risk-adjusted returns.


   MSCI ACWI Index vs. iShares ACWI ETF  

Typically, investors can't buy an index directly, such as the MSCI ACWI, since it's designed to represent a measurement of performance and characteristics of various sectors, countries, and equity holdings.



Instead, investors can buy an ETF that tracks or mirrors the composition and performance of the index. Below is a comparison between the MSCI ACWI index and Blackrock's iShares MSCI ACWI ETF, including some of the top country, sector, and portfolio holdings.


  MSCI ACWI Index Country and Sector Weightings  

The countries representing the highest total market cap for the MSCI ACWI index are the U.S. (61.31%), Japan (5.54%), China (3.62%), the United Kingdom (3.6%), and Canada (2.9%). Below are the weightings for each sector as of Dec. 31, 2021.

  MSCI ACWI Index Top Holdings  

Below are the top ten holdings by their portfolio weighting within the index as of Dec. 31, 2021:



Apple Inc: 4.18%Microsoft Corp: 3.42%Amazon.com: 2.16%Tesla: 1.27%Alphabet A: 1.24%Alphabet C: 1.19%Meta Platforms A: 1.14%Nvidia: 1.05%Taiwan Semiconductor Mfg: 0.78%Unitedhealth Group: 0.67%



The top ten holdings represent 17.10% of the weighting for the index.


  iShares MSCI ACWI ETF  

One of the ETFs that track and invest in the MSCI ACWI index is Blackrock's iShares MSCI ACWI ETF, which has nearly $17.5 billion in assets under management (AUM) as of Jan. 25, 2022.



The ETF owns the stocks of 2,332 holdings from the index and has an expense ratio of 0.33% as of Jan. 25, 2022. The expense ratio represents the cost to investors for Blackrock to manage the fund.



The iShares ETF has the same sector and top ten holdings with nearly the same portfolio weightings as the MSCI ACWI index as of Jan. 25, 2022. Below is the fund's performance versus the MSCI ACWI index as of Dec. 31, 2021.

   Alternatives to the MSCI ACWI for Global Equities  

An investor seeking to diversify their portfolio geographically could invest a portion of their funds in an ETF that tracks the MSCI ACWI All Cap Index, which has more than 15,000 equity holdings from 23 developed markets and 25 emerging markets. This would provide exposure to a wide range of global stocks but include many more small and mid-cap stocks.



It's important to note that investors should be aware that an index containing foreign equities might also contain U.S. stocks. As a result, investors should monitor whether they'd be overexposed to U.S. equities if they have already allocated a significant portion of their portfolio to U.S. stocks. Please consult a qualified financial advisor to determine the best asset allocation strategy for your investment needs and long-term financial goals.
What Is MSCI?  

MSCI is an acronym for Morgan Stanley Capital International. It is an investment research firm that provides stock indexes, portfolio risk and performance analytics, and governance tools to institutional investors and hedge funds. MSCI is perhaps best known for its benchmark indexes—including the MSCI Emerging Market Index and MSCI Frontier Markets Index—which are managed by MSCI Barra. The company continues to launch new indexes each year.





Key Takeaways

MSCI provides investment data and analytics services to investors.MSCI was formed when Morgan Stanley bought the licensing rights to Captial International data in 1986.The firm is perhaps best known for its series of stock indexes, which are used by many mutual funds and ETFs as benchmarks.


   Understanding MSCI  

Capital International introduced a number of stock indexes in 1965 to mirror the international markets—the first global stock market indexes for markets outside the United States. When Morgan Stanley bought the licensing rights to Capital's data in 1998, it began using the acronym MSCI, with Morgan Stanley becoming its largest shareholder.



In 2004, MSCI acquired Barra, a risk management and portfolio analytics firm, for approximately $816.4 million. The merger of both entities resulted in a new firm, MSCI Barra, which was spun off in an initial public offering (IPO) in 2007, and began trading on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) under the stock ticker MSCI. The firm became a fully independent, stand-alone public company in 2009.



The firm provides its clients with investment tools including those from Barra, RiskMetrics, and Measurisk. It also publishes indexes that are widely available to the investing public.


   MSCI Indexes  

MSCI is perhaps best known for its stock indexes, which focus on different geographic areas and stock types such as small-caps, mid-caps, and large-caps. They track the performance of the stocks that are included in them and act as a base for exchange-traded funds (ETFs). As of Q4 2022, there were $14.97 trillion in assets under management (AUM) benchmarked to the firm's indexes.



MSCI offers more than 160,000 indexes. Some of the most widely used are the Emerging Markets Index, Frontier Markets Index, All Country World Index, and EAFE Index.


  MSCI Emerging Market Index  

Launched in 1988, this index lists constituents from 24 emerging economies including China, Egypt, India, Korea, Thailand, Brazil, South Africa, and Mexico. It compiles the market capitalization of all the companies that are listed on these countries' stock exchanges. 



The Emerging Markets Index is considered a good way to track the performance and growth of emerging markets. Emerging markets offer investors growth potential as their economies expand, as well as creating risk diversification for global investors.


  MSCI Frontier Markets Index  

The Frontier Market Index is used to track markets in countries that are considered more volatile and unpredictable than emerging markets. This index focuses on 28 markets from the Middle East, Africa, South America, and Europe. Some of the frontier regions with stocks included in this index are Vietnam, Morocco, Iceland, Romania, and Bahrain.



Frontier markets can be profitable for investors since they have plenty of room for growth. However, they are not heavily traded, which can make them difficult to sell if a country's economy takes a downturn due to global or local changes.


  MSCI All Country World Index (ACWI)  

This is the firm's flagship global equity index, which tracks the performance of small- to large-cap stocks from 23 developed and 24 emerging markets. The more than 2,900 stocks represented are for companies that have a global presence. It covers about 85% of the market capitalization in each market that it includes.



The ACWI is often used as a way to represent the global stock market.


 MSCI EAFE Index 

EAFE is an abbreviation for Europe, Australasia, and the Far East. This lists 826 stocks from 21 developed market countries excluding Canada and the United States. It covers approximately 85% of the market capitalization in each of the countries it includes.



EAFE countries are considered highly stable. They are widely traded, making it easy to both buy and sell, even in times of economic trouble.


   Index Reviews and Weightings  

The MSCI indexes are market cap-weighted indexes, which means stocks are weighted according to their market capitalization—calculated as stock price multiplied by the total number of shares outstanding. The stock with the largest market capitalization gets the highest weighting on the index. This reflects the fact that large-cap companies have a bigger impact on an economy than mid- or small-cap companies. A percent change in the price of the large-cap stocks in an MSCI index will lead to a bigger movement in the index than a change in the price of a small-cap company.



Each index in the MSCI family is reviewed quarterly and rebalanced twice a year. Stocks are added or removed from an index by analysts within MSCI to ensure that the index still acts as an effective equity benchmark for the market it represents.






When an MSCI index is rebalanced, ETFs and mutual funds must also adjust their fund holdings since they are created to mirror the performance of the indexes. 




What Is the Purpose of MSCI?
MSCI provides tools to support and inform the investment industry. The firm provides research, data, and tools to help clients analyze and invest in different global markets. MSCI is also known for its stock indexes, which are used as benchmarks for funds tracking different global markets.




What Is the Difference Between the S&P 500 and MSCI?
The S&P 500 Index is a market value-weighted index of 500 stocks that generally represent the broader U.S. stock market. The MSCI All Country World Index is a market capitalization-weighted index that measures market performance in both developed and emerging markets.




How Many Stocks Are In the MSCI World?
The MSCI All Country World Index includes nearly 3,000 stocks from 47 markets. It includes both developed and emerging markets around the world.


   The Bottom Line  

Morgan Stanley Capital International, or MSCI, is a firm that provides investment data and analytics services to investors. It was formed in 1986 when Morgan Stanley bought the licensing rights to data from Captial International.



MSCI is known for its stock indexes, which are used by mutual funds, ETFs, and individual investors as market benchmarks. There are multiple MSCI indexes tracking different sectors of the global economy, including emerging, frontier, developed, and global markets.
What Is a Multi-Asset Class?  

A multi-asset class, also known as a multiple-asset class or multi-asset fund, is a combination of asset classes (such as cash, equity or bonds) used as an investment. A multi-asset class investment contains more than one asset class, thus creating a group or portfolio of assets. The weights and types of classes vary according to the individual investor.


   How Multi-Asset Classes Work  

Multi-asset class investments increase the diversification of an overall portfolio by distributing investments throughout several classes. This reduces risk (volatility) compared to holding one class of assets, but might also hinder potential returns. For example, a multi-asset class investor might hold bonds, stocks, cash, and real property, whereas a single-class investor might only hold stocks. One asset class might outperform during a particular period of time, but historically, no asset class will outperform during every period.


   Risk Tolerance Funds  

Many mutual fund companies offer asset allocation funds that are designed to perform according to an investor’s tolerance for risk. The funds can range from aggressive to conservative. An aggressive-style fund would have a much higher allocation to equities, with maybe as much as 100%.



The Fidelity Asset Manager 85% fund (“FAMRX”) is an example of an aggressive fund. The fund is designed to keep 85% of the fund’s allocation in equities and 15% between fixed income and cash. For conservative investors, a fund’s allocation would have significantly more concentration in fixed income. The Fidelity Asset Manager 20% fund (“FASIX”) has 20% in stocks, 50% in fixed income, and 30% in short-term money market funds.





Key Takeaways

A multi-asset class is primarily built to limit downside risk by broadening an investors exposure to different sectors.Some ETFs could be considered multi-asset class investments.Multi-asset class investments can change over time to accommodate investor direction. A classic example of this is a target-date fund. 


   Target Date Funds  

Target date funds are multi-asset funds that change the allocation according to the investor’s time horizon. Investors would select the fund that would closely mirror their time horizon. For example, an investor not retiring for over 30 years should select one of the 2045 or later target funds. The later the date on the fund, the more aggressive the fund is due to the longer time horizon. A 2050 target-date fund has over 85 to 90% in equities and the remaining in fixed income or money market.



An investor whose time horizon is significantly shorter would select one of the more recent maturing funds. Someone retiring in five years would have a target-date fund with a higher level of fixed income to reduce the overall risk and focus on capital preservation.



Target date funds are beneficial for investors who do not want to be involved in choosing an appropriate asset allocation. As the investor ages and the time horizon lessens, so does the risk level of the target date fund. Over time, the fund gradually moves from equities to fixed income and money market automatically.


   Benefits of Multi-Asset Class Funds  

Unlike balanced funds, which typically focus on meeting or beating a benchmark, multi-asset class funds are composed to achieve a certain investment outcome, such as exceeding inflation. Their broad options for investing, ranging across securities, sectors, real estate, and other types of securities, give them enormous flexibility to meet their goals.



This type of fund also offers more diversification than most balanced funds, which may combine mainly fixed income and equities. Many are actively managed, meaning a person or group of people make decisions based on the dynamics of the market to maximize returns and limit risk.
What Is a Multi-Factor Model?  

A multi-factor model is a financial model that employs multiple factors in its calculations to explain market phenomena and/or equilibrium asset prices. A multi-factor model can be used to explain either an individual security or a portfolio of securities. It does so by comparing two or more factors to analyze relationships between variables and the resulting performance.





Key Takeaways

A multi-factor model is a financial modeling strategy in which multiple factors are used to analyze and explain asset prices.Multi-factor models reveal which factors have the most impact on the price of an asset.Multi-factor portfolios can be constructed using various methods: intersectional, combinational, and sequential modeling.The beta of a security measures the systematic risk of a security in relation to the overall market.The Fama-French three-factor model is a well-known tool that builds upon the capital asset pricing model, which focuses solely on the market risk factor, by incorporating size and value factors.


   Understanding a Multi-Factor Model  

Multi-factor models are used to construct portfolios with certain characteristics, such as risk, or to track indexes. When constructing a multi-factor model, it is difficult to decide how many and which factors to include. Also, models are judged on historical numbers, which might not accurately predict future values.



Multi-factor models also help explain the weight of the different factors used in the models, indicating which factor has more of an impact on the price of an asset.


   Multi-Factor Model Formula  

Factors are compared using the following formula:



Ri = ai + _i(m) * Rm + _i(1) * F1 + _i(2) * F2 +...+_i(N) * FN + ei



Where:



Ri is the return of security



Rm is the market return



F(1, 2, 3 ... N) is each of the factors used



_ is the beta with respect to each factor including the market (m)



e is the error term



a is the intercept


   Types of Multi-Factor Models  

Multi-factor models can be divided into three categories: macroeconomic models, fundamental models, and statistical models.



Macroeconomic models: Macroeconomic models compare a security's return to such factors as employment, inflation, and interest.



Fundamental models: Fundamental models analyze the relationship between a security's return and its underlying financials, such as earnings, market capitalization, and debt levels.



Statistical models: Statistical models are used to compare the returns of different securities based on the statistical performance of each security in and of itself. Many times, historical data is used in this type of modeling.


   Construction of Multi-Factor Models  

The three most commonly used models to construct a multi-factor model are a combination model, a sequential model, and an intersectional model.



Combination model: In a combination model, multiple single-factor models, which utilize a single factor to distinguish stocks, are combined to create a multi-factor model. For example, stocks may be sorted based on momentum alone in the first pass. Subsequent passes will use other factors, such as volatility, to classify them.



Sequential model: A sequential model sorts stocks based on a single factor in a sequential manner to create a multi-factor model. For example, stocks for a specific market capitalization may be sequentially analyzed for various factors, such as value and momentum, sequentially.



Intersectional model: In the intersectional model, stocks are sorted based on their intersections for factors. For example, stocks may be sorted and classified based on intersections in value and momentum.


   Measurement of Beta  

The beta of a security measures the systematic risk of a security in relation to the overall market. A beta of 1 indicates that the security theoretically experiences the same degree of volatility as the market and moves in tandem with the market.



A beta greater than 1 indicates the security is theoretically more volatile than the market. Conversely, a beta less than 1 indicates the security is theoretically less volatile than the market.



When multi-factor models are used by investment managers to assess the risk of investments, beta is an important factor that they can use.


   Fama-French Three-Factor Model  

One widely used multi-factor model is the Fama-French three-factor model. The Fama-French model has three factors: the size of firms, book-to-market values, and excess returns on the market. In other words, the three factors used are SMB (small minus big), HML (high minus low), and the portfolio's return less the risk-free rate of return.



SMB accounts for publicly traded companies with small market caps that generate higher returns, while HML accounts for value stocks with high book-to-market ratios that generate higher returns in comparison to the market.
What Is Multicollinearity?  

Multicollinearity is the occurrence of high intercorrelations among two or more independent variables in a multiple regression model. Multicollinearity can lead to skewed or misleading results when a researcher or analyst attempts to determine how well each independent variable can be used most effectively to predict or understand the dependent variable in a statistical model.



In general, multicollinearity can lead to wider confidence intervals that produce less reliable probabilities in terms of the effect of independent variables in a model.



In technical analysis, multicollinearity can lead to incorrect assumptions about an investment. It generally occurs because multiple indicators of the same type have been used to analyze a stock.





Key Takeaways

Multicollinearity is a statistical concept where several independent variables in a model are correlated.Two variables are considered perfectly collinear if their correlation coefficient is +/- 1.0.Multicollinearity among independent variables will result in less reliable statistical inferences.When you're analyzing an investment, it is better to use different types of indicators rather than multiple indicators of the same type to avoid multicollinearity.Multicollinearity can lead to less reliable results because the results you're comparing are generally the same.


   Understanding Multicollinearity  

Statistical analysts use multiple regression models to predict the value of a specified dependent variable based on the values of two or more independent variables. The dependent variable is sometimes called the outcome, target, or criterion variable.



An example is a multivariate regression model that attempts to anticipate stock returns based on metrics such as the price-to-earnings ratio (P/E ratios), market capitalization, or other data. The stock return is the dependent variable (the outcome), and the various bits of financial data are the independent variables.



Multicollinearity in a multiple regression model indicates that collinear independent variables are not truly independent. For example, past performance might be related to market capitalization. The stocks of businesses that have performed well experience investor confidence, increasing demand for that company's stock, which increases its market value.


  Effects of Multicollinearity  

Although multicollinearity does not affect the regression estimates, it makes them vague, imprecise, and unreliable. Thus, it can be hard to determine how the independent variables influence the dependent variable individually. This inflates the standard errors of some or all of the regression coefficients.


  Detecting Multicollinearity  

A statistical technique called the variance inflation factor (VIF) can detect and measure the amount of collinearity in a multiple regression model. VIF measures how much the variance of the estimated regression coefficients is inflated as compared to when the predictor variables are not linearly related. A VIF of 1 will mean that the variables are not correlated; a VIF between 1 and 5 shows that variables are moderately correlated, and a VIF between 5 and 10 will mean that variables are highly correlated.



When analyzing stocks, you can detect multicollinearity by noting whether the indicators graph the same. For instance, choosing two momentum indicators on a trading chart will generally create trend lines that indicate the same momentum.


   Reasons for Multicollinearity  

Multicollinearity can exist when two independent variables are highly correlated. It can also happen if an independent variable is computed from other variables in the data set or if two independent variables provide similar and repetitive results.



Again, if you're using the same data to create two or three of the same type of trading indicators, the outcomes will be multicollinear because the data and its manipulation to create the indicators are very similar.






The statistical inferences from a model that contains multicollinearity may not be dependable.


   Types of Multicollinearity  
  Perfect Multicollinearity  

Perfect multicollinearity demonstrates a linear relationship that is exact between multiple independent variables. This is usually seen on a chart where the data points fall along the regression line. In technical analysis, it can be seen when you use two indicators that measure the same thing, such as volume. If you overlaid one on top of the other, there would be no difference between them.


  High Multicollinearity  

High multicollinearity demonstrates a correlation between multiple independent variables, but it is not as tight as in perfect multicollinearity. Not all data points fall on the regression line, but it still signifies data is too tightly correlated to be used.



In technical analysis, indicators with high multicollinearity have very similar outcomes.


  Structural Multicollinearity  

Structural multicollinearity occurs when you use data to create new features. For instance, if you collected data and then used it to perform other calculations and ran a regression on the results, the outcomes will be correlated because they are derived from each other.



This is the type of multicollinearity seen in investment analysis because the same data is used to create different indicators.


  Data Based Multicollinearity  

A poorly designed experiment or data collection process, such as using observational data, generally results in data-based multicollinearity, where data is correlated due to the nature of the way it was collected. Some or all of the variables are correlated.



Stock data used to create indicators is generally collected from historical prices and trading volume, so the chances of it being multicollinear due to a poor collection method are small.


   Multicollinearity in Investing  

For investing, multicollinearity is a common consideration when performing technical analysis to predict probable future price movements of a security, such as a stock or a commodity future.



Market analysts want to avoid using technical indicators that are collinear in that they are based on very similar or related inputs; the inputs referred to here are not the data itself but how it was manipulated to achieve the outcome.



Instead, the analysis must be based on markedly different indicators to ensure that the market is analyzed from independent analytical viewpoints. For example, momentum and trend indicators share the same data, but they will not be perfectly multicollinear or even demonstrate high multicollinearity. These two indicators have different outcomes based on how the data was manipulated.






Most investors won't worry about the data and techniques behind the indicator calculations—it's enough to understand what multicollinearity is and how it can affect an analysis.


   How to Fix Multicollinearity  

One of the most common ways of eliminating the problem of multicollinearity is first to identify collinear independent predictors and then remove one or more of them. Generally, in statistics, a variance inflation factor calculation is run to determine the degree of multicollinearity. An alternative method for fixing multicollinearity is to collect more data under different conditions.


  In Investment Analysis  

Noted technical analyst John Bollinger, creator of the Bollinger Bands indicator, notes that "a cardinal rule for the successful use of technical analysis requires avoiding multicollinearity amid indicators." To solve the problem, analysts avoid using two or more technical indicators of the same type. Instead, they analyze a security using one type of indicator, such as a momentum indicator, and then do a separate analysis using a different type of indicator, such as a trend indicator.

For example, stochastics, the relative strength index (RSI), and Williams %R (Wm%R) are all momentum indicators that rely on similar inputs and are likely to produce similar results. In the image above, the stochastics and Wm%R are the same, so using them together doesn't reveal much. In this case, it is better to remove one of the indicators and use one that isn't tracking momentum. In the image below, stochastics show price momentum, and the Bollinger Band Width shows price consolidation before price movement.

How Can One Deal With Multicollinearity?
To reduce the amount of multicollinearity found in a statistical model, one can remove the specific variables identified as the most collinear. You can also try to combine or transform the offending variables to lower their correlation. If that does not work or is unattainable, there are modified regression models that better deal with multicollinearity, such as ridge regression, principal component regression, or partial least squares regression. In stock analysis, the best method is to choose different types of indicators.




What Is Multicollinearity in Regression?
Multicollinearity describes a relationship between variables that causes them to be correlated. Data with multicollinearity poses problems for analysis because they are not independent.




How Do You Interpret Multicollinearity Results?
Data will have high multicollinearity when the variable inflation factor is more than five. If the VIF is between one and five, variables are moderately correlated, and if equal to one, they are not correlated. In technical analysis, the indicators will be generally identical.




What Is Perfect Collinearity?
Perfect collinearity exists when there is an exact 1:1 correspondence between two independent variables in a model. This can be either a correlation of +1.0 or -1.0.




Why Is Multicollinearity a Problem?
Multicollinearity is a problem because it produces regression model results that are less reliable. This is due to wider confidence intervals (larger standard errors) that can lower the statistical significance of regression coefficients. In stock analysis, it can lead to false impressions or assumptions about an investment.


   The Bottom Line  

Multicollinearity exists whenever an independent variable is highly correlated with one or more of the other independent variables in a multiple regression equation. Multicollinearity is a problem because it will make the statistical inferences less reliable. However, the Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) can provide information about which variable or variables are redundant, and thus the variables that have a high VIF can be removed.



When using technical analysis, multicollinearity becomes a problem because there are many indicators that present the data in the same way. To prevent this, it's best to use indicators that don't measure the same trend.
What Is a Multilateral Development Bank (MDB)?  

A multilateral development bank (MDB) is an international financial institution chartered by two or more countries for the purpose of encouraging economic development in poorer nations. Multilateral development banks consist of member nations from developed and developing countries. MDBs provide loans and grants to member nations to fund projects that support social and economic development, such as the building of new roads or providing clean water to communities.





Key Takeaways

Multilateral development banks (MDBs) originated in the aftermath of World War II to rebuild war-ravaged nations and stabilize the global financial system.Today, MDBs fund infrastructure, energy, education, and environmental sustainability in developing countries.While commercial banks seek to make profits on loans and other financial services, the goal of MDBs is to issue grants and low-cost loans to improve the economic conditions of impoverished or developing nations.MDBs now operate throughout the world and control trillions of dollars in assets.


   How a Multilateral Development Bank (MDB) Works  

Multilateral development banks are subject to international law. They and other international financial institutions, such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF), originated in the waning days of World War II when the United States and its allies established the Bretton Woods institutions to rebuild war-ravaged nations and stabilize the post-war international financial system. The World Bank, which has been semi-officially dominated by the U.S. since its founding, is one of these institutions.



Unlike commercial banks, MDBs do not seek to maximize profits for their shareholders. Instead, they prioritize development goals, such as ending extreme poverty and reducing economic inequality. They often lend at low or no interest or provide grants to fund projects in infrastructure, energy, education, environmental sustainability, and other areas that promote development.



"At a time when few institutions were lending during the global financial crisis, the MDBs provided $222 billion in financing, which was critical to global stabilization efforts," according to the U.S. Department of the Treasury.






Along with financial assistance, multilateral development banks often provide member nations with advisers, auditors, and expert assistance in implementing and monitoring bank-funded projects.


   Types of Multilateral Development Banks  

There are two main forms of multilateral development banks. The first, which includes the largest and best-known institutions, makes loans and grants. These banks often distinguish between poorer, borrowing members and wealthier, non-borrowing members. Examples include the World Bank, founded in 1945, and the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB), founded in 1959.



The second type of multilateral development bank is formed by governments of low-income countries that can then borrow collectively via the MDB in order to secure more favorable rates. The Caribbean Development Bank (CDB), founded in 1969, is an example of this type.






According to the World Bank's 2019 Annual Report, the organization disbursed $49.4 billion during the year to member countries in the form of grants and low-interest loans.


   Special Considerations  

Many countries have chafed at the U.S.'s influence over the World Bank and regional MDBs, such as the Asian Development Bank, founded in 1966 and based in the Philippines. In October 2013 Chinese President Xi Jinping proposed the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) as an alternative to these American-dominated institutions. The AIIB began operations in 2016, with headquarters in Beijing.



The U.S. reportedly attempted to discourage allies from signing on to the project, putting pressure on South Korea and Australia in particular. Both ended up joining, along with 58 other members and 22 prospective members. As of 2019, the AIIB has grown to 70 members and 23 prospective members.

What Is the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA)?  

The Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency is an international institution that promotes investment in developing countries by offering political and economic risk insurance.



By promoting foreign direct investment into developing countries, the agency aims to support economic growth, reduce poverty, and improve people’s lives.





Key Takeaways

The Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) is an international institution that promotes investment in developing countries by offering political and economic risk insurance. The agency aims to support economic growth, reduce poverty, and improve people’s lives through foreign direct investment into developing countries.MIGA is a member of the World Bank Group and has 182 member states as of September 2022.


   Understanding the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA)  

The Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) is a member of the World Bank Group and is headquartered in Washington, D.C. As of September 2022, 182 member governments make up MIGA—154 developing nations and another 28 industrialized countries.


  A Brief History of MIGA  

The agency was created to complement both public and private investment insurance sources against non-commercial risks in developing countries. Its multilateral character and sponsorship by advanced and developing nations were seen as bolstering confidence among people going across borders to invest their money.



In September 1985, the World Bank endorsed the idea of a multilateral political risk insurance provider and established MIGA in April 1988. The agency started out with $1 billion worth of capital among its initial 29 member states. These nations included Bahrain, Bangladesh, Barbados, Canada, Chile, Cyprus, Denmark, Ecuador, Egypt, Germany, Grenada, Indonesia, Jamaica, Japan, Jordan, Korea, Kuwait, Lesotho, Malawi, Netherlands, Nigeria, Pakistan, Samoa, Saudi Arabia, Senegal, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom, and the United States.



In 1991, the number of member states of MIGA topped 100. Eight years later, guarantees issued by the agency reached a total of $1.3 billion, topping the $1 billion dollar mark for the first time ever. The agency also provided guarantees worth $1.2 billion in 2009 to support the economies in Europe and Central Asia following the global financial crisis. 


  What MIGA Does  

MIGA offers a variety of services in order to encourage foreign direct investment. These include risk insurance against foreign exchange restrictions, an outbreak of conflicts or wars, imposed spending limits, and related restrictions on company assets. 



In addition to providing political risk insurance to corporations that want to invest in developing countries, MIGA offers advisory services to developing country governments. The organization advises on the policies and procedures these governments should follow and the best ways these countries can attract foreign investment. Other services by MIGA include licensing arrangements, franchising, and technology support.



To help ease the flow of foreign investment dollars into certain regions, the agency supports and runs a number of international projects. One of those is the Afghanistan Investment Guarantee Facility, launched in 2005. The agency's aim was to help the country in its reconstruction efforts while the country was embroiled in the war by opening up the doors to direct foreign investment. 


  MIGA's Current Leadership Team   

According to MIGA, the people in its group have experience in political risk insurance and are well versed in banking and capital markets, environmental and social sustainability, project finance and sector specialties, and international law and dispute settlement.



The group's current management team include Hiroshi Matano, Executive Vice President, and Junaid Kamal Ahmad, Senior Vice President, Operations.
What Is a Multilateral Trading Facility (MTF)?  

A multilateral trading facility (MTF) is a European term for a trading system that facilitates the exchange of financial instruments between multiple parties.



MTFs allow eligible contract participants to gather and transfer a variety of securities, especially instruments that may not have an official market. These facilities are often electronic systems controlled by approved market operators or larger investment banks. Traders usually submit orders electronically, where a matching software engine pairs buyers with sellers.





Key Takeaways

A multilateral trading facility (MTF) provides retail investors with an alternative platform to trade financial securities.Market operators and investment banks usually operate MTFs.MTFs operate under the EU’s MiFID II legislative framework.MTFs typically offer more exotic trading instruments and over-the-counter (OTC) products.MTFs are known as Alternative Trading Systems (ATS) in the United States.


   Understanding a Multilateral Trading Facility (MTF)  

MTFs provide retail investors and investment firms with an alternative to traditional exchanges. Before their introduction, investors had to rely on national securities exchanges such as Euronext or the London Stock Exchange (LSE).



MTFs have fewer restrictions surrounding the admittance of financial instruments for trading, allowing participants to exchange more exotic assets and over-the-counter (OTC) products. For example, the LMAX Exchange offers spot foreign exchange and precious metals trading.



Faster transaction speeds, lower costs and trading incentives have helped MTFs become increasingly popular in Europe, although the NASDAQ OMX Europe was closed in 2010 as MTFs face intense competition with each other and established exchanges. The introduction of MTFs has led to greater fragmentation in the financial markets since single securities may now list across multiple venues. Brokers responded by offering smart order routing (SOR) and other strategies to secure the best price between these many venues.



MTFs operate under the European Union’s (EU's) MiFID II regulatory environment—a revised legislative framework designed to protect investors and instill confidence in the financial industry.


   MTFs in the United States  

In the United States, Alternative Trading Systems (ATS) operate similarly to MTFs. ATSs are regulated as broker-dealers rather than exchanges in most cases, but must still be approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and meet certain restrictions.



In recent years, the SEC has intensified its enforcement activities surrounding ATSs in a move that could lead to stricter MTF regulation in Europe. This is especially true for dark pools and other ATSs that are relatively obscure and difficult to trade and value.



The most widely known ATSs in the United States are Electronic Communication Networks (ECNs)—computerized systems that automatically match buy and sell orders for securities in the market.






In the United States, Alternative Trading Facilities (ATSs) are similar to the European MTFs.


   Benefits of MTFs  

Multilateral trading facilities offer multiple advantages for buying and selling securities and other assets. One key advantage is that the operators cannot pick and choose which trades to execute: they must set and follow clear rules, allowing transparency in trades and pricing.



With high-speed trading, MTFs use computer algorithms to match buyers and sellers. This facilitates higher liquidity than over-the-counter trades, resulting in lower bid-ask spreads and more effective price discovery. Moreover, MTFs typically operate on a commission basis, meaning that they have no conflicts of interest with individual traders.


   Real-World Examples  

Investment banks and financial data companies can leverage economies of scale to compete with traditional securities exchanges and potentially realize synergies with their existing trading operations.



Some investment banks, which already ran internal crossing systems, have also converted their internal systems into MTFs. For example, UBS Group established its own MTF that works in conjunction with its internal crossing systems.



In 2019, financial data and media company Bloomberg announced that it received authorization from the Netherlands Authority for the Financial Markets (AFM) to operate an MTF from Amsterdam throughout the EU. Bloomberg’s MTF provides quote and trading functionality to eligible participants in products such as cash bonds, repos, credit default swaps (CDS), interest rate securities (IRS), exchange-traded funds (ETF), equity derivatives, and forex (FX) derivatives.




What Is the Difference Between an MTF and an OTF?
An Organized Trading Facility, or OTF, is a new type of European trading venue for bonds, derivatives, and emissions allowances, but not equities. Multilateral Trading Facilities can trade in stocks and other equity products.In addition, the operators of OTFs are required to exercise discretion when they place orders. As the Dutch Authority for Financial Markets explains, "The operator of an OTF does have a degree of discretion in deciding whether to place or withdraw an order on its OTF and in deciding not to match a client order with other orders available in the systems of the OTF."




What Are Some of the Largest Multilateral Trading Facilities?
The largest Multilateral Trading Facility is the London-based Chi X-Europe, which is passported across the European Economic Area and regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority. Other notable entities include Liquidnet Europe, Currenex MTF, and UBS MTF.




What Products Can Be Traded on Bloomberg’s Multilateral Trading Facility?
Bloomberg's Multilateral Trading Facility, or BMTF, can be used to trade bonds, repos, credit default swaps, interest rate swaps, exchange-traded funds, equity derivatives, and foreign exchange derivatives.

What Is Multilevel Marketing (MLM)?  

The term marketing (MLM) refers to a strategy used by some direct sales companies to sell products and services. MLM encourages existing members to promote and sell their offerings to other individuals and bring on new recruits into the business. Distributors are paid a percentage of their recruits' sales. New recruits become the distributor's network or downline and are, in turn, encouraged to make sales to earn money.



Many MLM schemes are legal, but there are also illegal operations that are run as pyramid schemes. This has cast some negative light on legitimate MLM businesses.

   Understanding Multilevel Marketing (MLM)  

Multilevel marketing is a legitimate business strategy that is commonly used by businesses that rely (heavily) on sales to generate revenue. Unlike traditional sales channels, multilevel marketing programs involve the use of networks for sales and to recruit new participants. As such, they're often referred to as network marketing.



Here's how it works. Individuals are brought into the business as contractors, independent business owners, distributors, or direct salespeople. These people are then tasked with selling the company's products and/or services to others, including family and friends. Sales can be done in person or online. They are given a commission for every sale they make.



Participants are also encouraged to bring in or recruit others into the program as participants. While they may not be pressured to do so, signing up new contractors provides a financial incentive for participants, who receive a percentage of the sales of their recruits. and their recruits, and of their recruits, and so on.



There can be hundreds—even thousands—of participants, depending on the size of a company. Members at all levels receive some form of commission, as long as the chain keeps going. The more layers there are, the more money people can make. Think of it as a pyramid. The person or people at the top earn the most while those who sit toward the bottom earn fewer commission dollars. Relatively few, though, generally earn any meaningful income from their efforts.





Is MLM Right For You?

Because multilevel marketing plans are commission-based, the participants do not receive salaries. That means that MLM businesses are often best-suited for people with an entrepreneurial spirit, who can set their own goals and schedules, who are good at sales, and who can effectively network with others not only to sell products but to recruit new marketers.


   Special Considerations  

Although it is legal, multilevel marketing is often controversial. One problem is pyramid schemes that use money from new recruits to pay people at the top rather than those who perform the work. These schemes (and the people behind them) take advantage of others by pretending to be engaged in legitimate multilevel or network marketing. You can spot pyramid schemes by their greater focus on recruitment than on product sales.



An issue in determining the legitimacy of a multilevel marketing company is whether it sells its products primarily to consumers or to its members who must recruit new members to buy their products. If it is the former, the company is likely a legitimate multilevel marketer. If it is the latter, it could be an illegal pyramid scheme.



Relatively few earn meaningful incomes from their efforts. To some observers, this reflects the characteristics of a pyramid scheme. That's why the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has been investigating multilevel marketing companies for several decades.






You can often spot pyramid schemes by their far greater focus on recruitment than on product sales.


   Real-World Examples of Multilevel Marketing  

There are a lot of examples of multilevel marketing in the corporate world. The following are just two of the most popular and well-known companies that operate in this sphere.


  Amway  

Amway is a well-known direct sales company that uses MLM to generate revenue. The company, which sells health, beauty, and home care products in more than 100 countries, reported $8.9 billion in sales conducted by its independent business owners in 2021. This makes it the largest MLM business in the world, by revenue.


  Herbalife Nutrition  

Herbalife Nutrition is a high-profile MLM company that manufactures and distributes weight-loss and nutritional products. The company argues that most of its revenue is from product sales—not recruitment. It also says it offers members many protections, such as a money-back guarantee, so they will not be stuck with products they could not sell.



There have been multiple lawsuits against Herbalife accusing it of misrepresenting its sales practices, including a settlement reached with the FTC in 2016, under which it had to restructure its business.



Activist investor William Ackman also shed a national spotlight on the company by shorting $1 billion of the company’s stock in 2012. Ackman accused the company of operating a pyramid scheme, backing up his allegations with a bet that the stock price would fall under the weight of the scam. He gave up on that bet in 2018. The stock rose dramatically from that point through 2021, however it has since fallen to recent lows in 2022.




What Is MLM, and Is it Legal?
Broadly speaking, multilevel marketing is a sales structure where members of a company are encouraged to recruit new members. Once recruited, this salesperson receives a cut of their recruiter's sales. At the same time, each salesperson profits from the sale of a given product. MLMs are often legal, legitimate businesses whose distributors earn money from the sale of actual products and from commissions on products sold by distributors that they recruit.




Is Multilevel Marketing a Pyramid Scheme?
Multilevel marketing is controversial and often compared to pyramid schemes. While some multilevel marketing operations are legal, others have come under investigation. This typically occurs when the majority of the operation’s profits funnel up to the top, leaving little for the rest of its members.When an organization focuses primarily on recruitment, rather than selling products, this may also signal that it is operating under a pyramid scheme. Sometimes, members of these schemes will number in the hundreds or even thousands.

What Are Some Red Flags to Look Out for an Illegal MLM Pyramid Scheme?
The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) warns people to take note of, and avoid, MLM promoters who:Make extraordinary claims of enormous earning potentialTry to persuade people that recruiting others is where the real money liesPressure people to get involved without learning more about the companyMake it clear that an opportunity will be lost unless people get in immediatelyAnother warning sign is seeing existing distributors who continue to buy products that they can never sell so that they can qualify for some kind of reward.




What Is an Example of Multilevel Marketing?
Avon is an example of multilevel marketing. The company operates under a model where sales are driven through a network of salespeople, through presentations, or one-on-one settings in homes or businesses. Like a number of other multilevel marketing businesses, Avon typically does not operate a fixed retail location. The parent company, instead, provides the tools and resources to entrepreneurs to conduct their business at various locations. This type of business model is also referred to as a direct sales model.Other examples of MLM businesses include Tupperware, Rodan + Fields, Natura & Co., Vorwerk, Nu Skin, and PM International, among many others.
What Is a Multinational Corporation?  

A multinational corporation (MNC) is a company that has business operations in at least one country other than its home country. By some definitions, it also generates at least 25% of its revenue outside of its home country.



Generally, a multinational company has offices, factories, or other facilities in different countries around the world as well as a centralized headquarters which coordinates global management.



Multinational companies can also be known as international, stateless, or transnational corporate organizations or enterprises. Some may have budgets that exceed those of small countries. 





Key Takeaways


Multinational corporations conduct business in two or more countries.
Some consider a multinational company to be one that generates 25% or more of its revenue outside the home country.
An MNC can have a positive economic effect on the countries in which it operates.
Some believe outsourcing U.S. manufacturing to a foreign country has a negative effect on the U.S. economy.
Investing in a multinational corporation is a way to add international exposure to a portfolio.

   How a Multinational Corporation Works  

A multinational corporation is an enterprise whose business activities occur in at least two countries. Some may consider any company with a foreign branch to be a multinational corporation. Others may limit the definition to only those companies that derive at least a quarter of their revenue outside of their home country.



Multinational companies can make direct investments in foreign countries. Many are based in developed nations. Advocates say they create high-paying jobs and technologically advanced goods in countries that otherwise would not have access to such opportunities or goods.



However, critics of these enterprises believe multinational corporations exert undue political influence over governments, exploit developing nations, and create job losses in their own home countries.



The history of the multinational company is linked with the history of colonialism. Many of the first multinational companies were commissioned at the behest of European monarchs to conduct international expeditions.



Some of the colonies not held by Spain or Portugal existed under the administration of some of the world's earliest multinational companies. One of the first was The East India Company, established in 1600. This British multinational enterprise took part in international trade and exploration, and operated trading posts in India. Other early examples of multinational companies include the Swedish Africa Company, founded in 1649, and the Hudson's Bay Company, founded in 1670. 






   Characteristics of a Multinational Corporation  

Some of the characteristics common to various types of multinational corporations include:



A worldwide business presence
Typically, large and powerful organizations
Business conducted in various languages
A complicated business model and structure
Direct investments in foreign countries
Jobs created in foreign countries, potentially with higher wages than found locally
Seeks improved efficiencies, lower production costs, larger market share
Has substantial expenses associated with navigating rules and regulations of foreign countries
Pays taxes in countries in which it operates
Reports financial information according to International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS)
Sometimes accused of negative economic and/or environmental impacts in foreign markets
Sometimes accused of negative economic impacts in home country due to outsourcing jobs






U.S. multinational corporations employed 43.9 million workers throughout the world in 2019.


   4 Types of Multinational Corporations  

Multinational corporations can be viewed as four main organizational types.


  A Decentralized Corporation  

A decentralized corporation maintains a presence in its home country and has autonomous offices and other facilities in locations around the world. This type of multinational company has the capability to achieve more, faster because it's decentralized. Each office manages the local business itself, making its own decisions.


  A Centralized Global Corporation  

A centralized global corporation has a central headquarters in the home country. Executive officers and management located there oversee the global offices and operations as well as domestic operations. They, rather than managers at local offices in foreign countries, make the key business decisions. The offices typically must report to and obtain approval from headquarters personnel for major activities.


  An International Division Within a Corporation  

An international division is that part of the multinational corporation that has been made responsible for all international operations. This structure facilitates business decision-making and general activities in local, foreign markets. However, operating independently can pose problems when overall corporate consensus and action is required. Maintaining and presenting the carefully nurtured, enterprise-wide brand image established by the multinational may also be a challenge.


  A Transnational Corporation  

A transnational corporation involves a parent-subsidiary structure whereby the parent company oversees the operations of subsidiaries in foreign countries as well as in the home country. Subsidiaries can make use of the parent's assets, such as research and development data. Subsidiaries may be different brands, as well. The parent usually maintains a management role directing the operations of its subsidiaries, domestic and foreign.






Examples of multinational corporations include IBM, Berkshire Hathaway, Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, and Walmart. Nestlé S.A. is an example of a transnational corporation that executes business and operational decisions in and outside of its headquarters. One of its subsidiaries is Nespresso.


   Advantages and Disadvantages of Multinational Corporations  

International operations present a variety of advantages and disadvantages to multinational companies, consumers, and a workforce.


  Advantages  

Developing an international presence can open up new markets and sales opportunities unavailable or not feasible when operating just domestically. For example, a presence in a foreign country such as India can allow a corporation to meet widespread Indian demand for particular products without the transaction costs associated with long-distance shipping. 



Corporations can establish operations in markets where their capital can be used most efficiently and wages have less impact on the bottom line than they did in the home country.



By producing the same quality of goods at lower costs, multinational companies can reduce prices and increase the purchasing power of consumers worldwide.



Multinational companies can also take advantage of lower tax rates available in countries eager for their direct investments and the jobs that they'll create. Note, however, that the European Union has a plan to implement a minimum tax of 15% on corporate profits, to become effective in 2023.



Other benefits include a direct financial investment in foreign countries and job growth in their local economies.


  Disadvantages  

A trade-off of globalization—the price of lower prices—is that domestic jobs move overseas. This can increase unemployment in the home country and make it difficult for longtime employees in outsourced industries to find new jobs.



Those opposed to multinational corporations point to the potential they may have to develop a monopoly (for certain products). This can drive up prices for consumers, stifle competition, and inhibit innovation.



Multinational corporations are also said to have a detrimental effect on the environment because their operations may encourage land development and the depletion of local and natural resources. 



Multinational companies may also cause the downfall of small, local businesses. Activists have also claimed that multinational companies breach ethical standards. They accuse them of evading laws to advance their business agendas.




What Makes a Corporation Multinational?
A multinational corporation is one that has business offices and operations in two or more countries in the world. These companies are often managed from a central office headquartered in the home country. Simply exporting goods for sale abroad does not make a business a multinational company.




Why Would a Business Want to Become a Multinational Company?
Usually, the primary goal of a business is to increase profits and growth. If it can grow a global customer base and increase its market share abroad, it may believe that opening offices in foreign countries is worth the expense and effort. Companies may also see a benefit in certain tax structures or regulatory regimes found abroad.




What Are Some Risks That Multinational Corporations Face?
Multinational corporations are exposed to risks related to the different countries and regions in which they operate. These can include regulatory or legal risks, political instability, crime and violence, cultural sensitivities, as well as fluctuations in currency exchange rates. People in the home country may also resent the outsourcing of jobs.
What Is a Multiple?  

A multiple measures some aspect of a company's financial well-being, determined by dividing one metric by another metric. Metrics are quantitative tools that measure a company's performance. The metric in the numerator is typically larger than the one in the denominator. Investors use multiples to quantify a company's growth, productivity, and efficiency. They use multiples to make comparisons among companies and find the best investment opportunities.



For example, a multiple can be used to show how much investors are willing to pay per dollar of earnings, as computed by the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio. Assume you are analyzing a stock with $2 of earnings per share (EPS), which is trading at $20. This stock has a P/E of 10. This means investors are willing to pay a multiple of 10 times the current EPS for the stock.



This is calculated as:

Key Takeaways

A multiple measures the well-being of a company by comparing two metrics, usually by dividing one by the other.Investors generally rely on two stock valuation methods: one based on cash flow and the other based on a multiple of a performance measure.The most common multiple used in the valuation of stocks is the price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple.Enterprise value (EV) is a popular performance metric used to calculate different types of multiples, such as the EV to earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) multiple and the EV to sales multiple.


   Understanding Multiples  

In the world of stock valuation, investors and analysts generally rely on two major methods. One is based on cash flow, while the other is based on a multiple of some performance measure, such as earnings or sales. Valuation based on cash flow (i.e., the discounted cash flow analysis) is considered to be an intrinsic valuation. Valuation based on a multiple is considered to be relative because the multiple is relative to some performance measure. The multiples approach to valuation is a theory based on the concept that similar assets should sell for similar prices.


   Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Multiple  

The most common multiple used in the valuation of stocks is the P/E multiple. It is used to compare a company's market value (price) with its earnings. A company with a price or market value that is high compared to its level of earnings has a high P/E multiple. A company with a low price compared to its level of earnings has a low P/E multiple.



A P/E of 5x means a company’s stock is trading at a multiple of five times its earnings. A P/E of 10x means a company is trading at a multiple that is equal to 10 times earnings. A company with a high P/E is considered to be overvalued. Likewise, a company with a low P/E is considered to be undervalued.


   EV/EBITDA Multiple  

Enterprise value (EV) is a popular performance metric used to calculate different types of multiples. EV shows how much money would be needed to buy a specific company. The EV of a company is calculated by taking the company's market capitalization, adding total debt (including long-term and short-term debt), and subtracting all cash and cash equivalents. Many investors see EV as a better performance metric than relying on market capitalization alone because it offers a more complete picture of a company's valuation.



A widely used multiple is the EV to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) multiple, also referred to as EV/EBITDA. This multiple helps investors compare companies in the same industry or sector before making an investment decision.






Many equity analysts consider EV/EBITDA to be a solid measure of cash flow available to a firm.


   EV/EBIT Multiple  

The EV to earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) multiple, also referred to as EV/EBIT, is similar to the P/E multiple, but is preferred by some analysts for its ability to give a more complete picture of a company's financial performance and actual worth. The multiple is useful for pinpointing companies that might be undervalued or overvalued. It's best used for less capital-intensive companies, with fewer depreciation and amortization expenses.


   EV/Sales Multiple  

The EV to sales ratio, also referred to as EV/sales, compares the enterprise value of a company to its annual sales. The EV/sales multiple is considered an important valuation tool because it takes into account a company's equity and debt while giving investors a quantifiable metric of how to value a company based on sales. It's also useful in evaluating companies with negative earnings. To be most effective, investors should compare the EV/sales multiple of the company they are analyzing to that of other companies in the same industry.
What Is a Multiple Employer Welfare Arrangement (MEWA)?  

A multiple employer welfare arrangement (MEWA) is a system for marketing health and welfare benefits to employers, for their employees. Also described as a "multiple employer trust (MET)," a multiple employer welfare arrangement happens when a group of employers combines their contributions in a self-contributing benefits plan for the benefit of their employees.



For the arrangement to work, the employers must make contributions to the plan based on the number of employees they have and the estimated costs associated with each employee. MEWAs are a way for smaller companies to offer employee benefits outside of the government-run health insurance exchanges by sharing risk. They became popular as a result of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA).






For more on MEWAs from the Department of Labor, see ERISA's Multiple Employer Welfare Arrangement informational page, which lists the rules governing them, fact sheets, filing requirements, news releases, current amendments, public comments, and more.


   How a Multiple Employer Welfare Arrangement (MEWA) Works  

As defined by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA), a multiple employer welfare arrangement is "an employee welfare benefit plan, or any other arrangement which is established or maintained for the purpose of offering or providing" medical, surgical, or hospital care or benefits, or benefits in the event of sickness, accident, disability, death or unemployment, or vacation benefits, apprenticeship or other training programs, or daycare centers, scholarship funds, or prepaid legal services to the employees of two or more employers (including one or more self-employed individuals), or to their beneficiaries.



Overall, a multiple employer welfare arrangement is a good way for smaller employers to get group health and other insurance benefits for their employers. By pooling their contributions together, these smaller employers are better positioned to offer the best benefits packages from insurance companies due to economies of scale.



Also, since each employer is a partner in a MEWA, they have the ability to suggest plan changes, giving them more power over what they can offer employees than when they go it alone.


   Special Considerations  

There are some financial considerations and challenges that need to be taken into account when an employer is thinking of participating in a MEWA. In some cases, multiple employer welfare arrangements find themselves unable to pay claims as a result of inadequate funding or reserves. In more extreme cases, due to poor management or outright fraud and embezzlement, some MEWAs have seen their funds drained altogether.



As such, most MEWA administrators and participants buy stop-loss insurance to limit their liability. Such insurance covers errors and omissions, fidelity bonds, directors and officers, crime, cyber liability, and more.



MEWAs must follow ERISA law, and also may be subject to state insurance regulation, which can vary by jurisdiction (some states are MEWA-friendly; some not so much). An example of such state-level regulatory requirements can be found at the New Jersey Department of Banking and Insurance (an example of a state with generally higher oversight standards). At a minimum, MEWAs must follow filing, reporting and funding guidelines.





Key Takeaways

A multiple employer welfare arrangement (MEWA) is a way for a group of employers to pool their resources to get their employees better health-insurance options. With a MEWA, several employers combine contributions in a self-contributing benefits plan, making payments based on the number of employees and the estimated costs.MEWAs are particularly useful for small companies, allowing them to offer employee's benefits beyond the government-run health insurance exchanges by sharing risk.
What Is Multiple Linear Regression (MLR)?  

Multiple linear regression (MLR), also known simply as multiple regression, is a statistical technique that uses several explanatory variables to predict the outcome of a response variable. The goal of multiple linear regression is to model the linear relationship between the explanatory (independent) variables and response (dependent) variables. In essence, multiple regression is the extension of ordinary least-squares (OLS) regression because it involves more than one explanatory variable.





Key Takeaways

Multiple linear regression (MLR), also known simply as multiple regression, is a statistical technique that uses several explanatory variables to predict the outcome of a response variable.Multiple regression is an extension of linear (OLS) regression that uses just one explanatory variable.MLR is used extensively in econometrics and financial inference.

   What Multiple Linear Regression Can Tell You  

Simple linear regression is a function that allows an analyst or statistician to make predictions about one variable based on the information that is known about another variable. Linear regression can only be used when one has two continuous variables—an independent variable and a dependent variable. The independent variable is the parameter that is used to calculate the dependent variable or outcome. A multiple regression model extends to several explanatory variables.



The multiple regression model is based on the following assumptions:



There is a linear relationship between the dependent variables and the independent variables
The independent variables are not too highly correlated with each other
yi observations are selected independently and randomly from the population
Residuals should be normally distributed with a mean of 0 and variance σ



The coefficient of determination (R-squared) is a statistical metric that is used to measure how much of the variation in outcome can be explained by the variation in the independent variables. R2 always increases as more predictors are added to the MLR model, even though the predictors may not be related to the outcome variable.



R2 by itself can't thus be used to identify which predictors should be included in a model and which should be excluded. R2 can only be between 0 and 1, where 0 indicates that the outcome cannot be predicted by any of the independent variables and 1 indicates that the outcome can be predicted without error from the independent variables.



When interpreting the results of multiple regression, beta coefficients are valid while holding all other variables constant ("all else equal"). The output from a multiple regression can be displayed horizontally as an equation, or vertically in table form.


   Example of How to Use Multiple Linear Regression  

As an example, an analyst may want to know how the movement of the market affects the price of ExxonMobil (XOM). In this case, their linear equation will have the value of the S&P 500 index as the independent variable, or predictor, and the price of XOM as the dependent variable.



In reality, multiple factors predict the outcome of an event. The price movement of ExxonMobil, for example, depends on more than just the performance of the overall market. Other predictors such as the price of oil, interest rates, and the price movement of oil futures can affect the price of Exon Mobil (XOM) and the stock prices of other oil companies. To understand a relationship in which more than two variables are present, multiple linear regression is used.



Multiple linear regression (MLR) is used to determine a mathematical relationship among several random variables. In other terms, MLR examines how multiple independent variables are related to one dependent variable. Once each of the independent factors has been determined to predict the dependent variable, the information on the multiple variables can be used to create an accurate prediction on the level of effect they have on the outcome variable. The model creates a relationship in the form of a straight line (linear) that best approximates all the individual data points.



Referring to the MLR equation above, in our example:



yi = dependent variable—the price of XOM
xi1 = interest rates
xi2 = oil price
xi3 = value of S&P 500 index
xi4= price of oil futures
B0 = y-intercept at time zero
B1 = regression coefficient that measures a unit change in the dependent variable when xi1 changes - the change in XOM price when interest rates change
B2 = coefficient value that measures a unit change in the dependent variable when xi2 changes—the change in XOM price when oil prices change



The least-squares estimates—B0, B1, B2…Bp—are usually computed by statistical software. As many variables can be included in the regression model in which each independent variable is differentiated with a number—1,2, 3, 4...p. The multiple regression model allows an analyst to predict an outcome based on information provided on multiple explanatory variables.



Still, the model is not always perfectly accurate as each data point can differ slightly from the outcome predicted by the model. The residual value, E, which is the difference between the actual outcome and the predicted outcome, is included in the model to account for such slight variations.



Assuming we run our XOM price regression model through a statistics computation software, that returns this output:

An analyst would interpret this output to mean if other variables are held constant, the price of XOM will increase by 7.8% if the price of oil in the markets increases by 1%. The model also shows that the price of XOM will decrease by 1.5% following a 1% rise in interest rates. R2 indicates that 86.5% of the variations in the stock price of Exxon Mobil can be explained by changes in the interest rate, oil price, oil futures, and S&P 500 index.


   The Difference Between Linear and Multiple Regression  

Ordinary linear squares (OLS) regression compares the response of a dependent variable given a change in some explanatory variables. However, a dependent variable is rarely explained by only one variable. In this case, an analyst uses multiple regression, which attempts to explain a dependent variable using more than one independent variable. Multiple regressions can be linear and nonlinear.



Multiple regressions are based on the assumption that there is a linear relationship between both the dependent and independent variables. It also assumes no major correlation between the independent variables.




What Makes a Multiple Regression Multiple?
A multiple regression considers the effect of more than one explanatory variable on some outcome of interest. It evaluates the relative effect of these explanatory, or independent, variables on the dependent variable when holding all the other variables in the model constant.




Why Would One Use a Multiple Regression Over a Simple OLS Regression?
A dependent variable is rarely explained by only one variable. In such cases, an analyst uses multiple regression, which attempts to explain a dependent variable using more than one independent variable. The model, however, assumes that there are no major correlations between the independent variables.




Can I Do a Multiple Regression by Hand?
It's unlikely as multiple regression models are complex and become even more so when there are more variables included in the model or when the amount of data to analyze grows. To run a multiple regression you will likely need to use specialized statistical software or functions within programs like Excel.




What Does It Mean for a Multiple Regression to Be Linear?
In multiple linear regression, the model calculates the line of best fit that minimizes the variances of each of the variables included as it relates to the dependent variable. Because it fits a line, it is a linear model. There are also non-linear regression models involving multiple variables, such as logistic regression, quadratic regression, and probit models.




How Are Multiple Regression Models Used in Finance?
Any econometric model that looks at more than one variable may be a multiple. Factor models compare two or more factors to analyze relationships between variables and the resulting performance. The Fama and French Three-Factor Mod is such a model that expands on the capital asset pricing model (CAPM) by adding size risk and value risk factors to the market risk factor in CAPM (which is itself a regression model). By including these two additional factors, the model adjusts for this outperforming tendency, which is thought to make it a better tool for evaluating manager performance.
What Is a Multiple Listing Service (MLS)?  

A multiple listing service (MLS) is a database established by cooperating real estate brokers to provide data about properties for sale. An MLS allows brokers to see one another’s listings of properties for sale with the goal of connecting homebuyers to sellers. Under this arrangement, both the listing and selling brokers benefit by consolidating and sharing information and by sharing commissions.



Typically, multiple listing services create a book or an electronic database with all of the houses for sale by affiliated brokers, who update it on a regular basis. The participating parties distribute the book in print or online to each member of the service.

A multiple listing service (MLS) is a database established by cooperating real estate brokers to provide data about properties for sale. An MLS allows brokers to see one another’s listings of properties for sale with the goal of connecting homebuyers to sellers.An MLS helps real estate agents and brokers connect by consolidating and sharing information while sharing commissions.


   How a Multiple Listing Service (MLS) Works  

The multiple listing service was created in the 1800s to foster better cooperation among real estate agents when they realized each brokerage could sell their houses more effectively and serve their clients better by going outside their own brokerages’ listings. The MLS is essentially an agreement among real estate agents to list each other’s properties through a cooperative service. The first multiple listing services were circulated via catalogs, but almost all of them are online today.



The concept of an MLS is generic, with no governing MLS body, and the phrase cannot be trademarked or branded. Typically, real estate brokers work together in their local areas to create their own regional MLS. As a result, there are hundreds of regional databases that comprise all of the national listings found on various real estate agent websites.



Real estate agents and brokers pay dues or a membership fee for access to each MLS. In return, the agents receive information on the homes in an area, including listings, photos, and details such as square footage and features of each property. An MLS can only be accessed by licensed agents and brokers. Although each MLS may have its own procedures, they typically follow the rules set out by the National Association of Realtors (NAR).


   Why Multiple Listing Services Are Needed  

In the digital age, buyers can browse through countless real estate and brokerage websites. In spite of this increased exposure, the need for an MLS persists. If a buyer works with a broker who belongs to an MLS, then the broker can quickly and conveniently search all of the properties for sale by participating agents. In most cases, the MLS listing also contains private contact information and details about showing times. Without this consolidating service, the broker would need to look through several different websites, each for individual brokers, to find available properties in the area.


   Benefits of Multiple Listing Services  

Multiple listing services provide more exposure to the selling broker and more options to the broker representing the buyer. In return, both brokers receive a commission on the sale. These services also level the playing field by allowing small and large brokerages to compete with one another.



For example, imagine if a small brokerage were only able to offer its buyers the properties that the firm had listed. The firm’s buyers wouldn’t have access to all of the listings from other brokers in the area. However, with an MLS, the information is consolidated rather than fragmented. An MLS allows competing brokers to work together toward a common goal of helping buyers find their desired properties and helping sellers sell their properties.



As a result of the cooperation of the agents and brokers to create the MLS databases, prospective homebuyers gain access to numerous listings, while sellers get connected to buyers through their broker or agent. Even online real estate websites containing national listings—such as Zillow, Redfin, Trulia, etc.—actually pull data directly from all of the regional MLS databases.




Do I Need a Real Estate License to Access a Multiple Listing Service?
Typically, to view listings on your local multiple listing service (MLS) as a buyer or seller, you need to be given access through a real estate agent. To actually post properties on the MLS, you need to have a real estate license. If you are not willing to get a real estate license and don’t want to work with a full seller’s agent, several areas have flat-fee multiple listing services that will list your property for you.




What Fees Are Associated with the MLS?
There are hundreds of MLS organizations nationwide, and they all charge different fees directly to the real estate brokers who belong to their MLS network. The MLS does not charge fees directly to the public.




What is an MLS number?
An MLS number is essentially a serial number for each property on the market. It was created to make it easier to differentiate properties and find properties quickly. In contrast, the NMLS number, while similar and involved in real estate transactions, is issued by the Nationwide Multistate Licensing System and is permanently assigned to each individual who works as a mortgage loan officer.


   The Bottom Line  

The multiple listing service (MLS) exists to make it easier to find properties for sale and for you to sell your property. With the rise of massive real estate websites like Zillow, Trulia, Redfin, etc., searching through the MLS can feel outdated, but it is still the most accurate and up-to-date way to find homes for sale in most areas.
What Is the Multiples Approach?  

The multiples approach is a valuation theory based on the idea that similar assets sell at similar prices. It assumes that the type of ratio used in comparing firms, such as operating margins or cash flows, is the same across similar firms.



Investors also refer to the multiples approach as multiples analysis or valuation multiples. When doing so they may refer to a financial ratio, such as the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, as the earnings multiple.





Key Takeaways

The multiples approach is a comparables analysis or relative valuation method that seeks to evaluate similar companies using the same standardized financial metrics.Enterprise value multiples and equity multiples are the two categories of valuation multiples. Commonly used equity multiples include P/E multiple, PEG, price-to-book, and price-to-sales.


   The Basics of the Multiples Approach  

Generally, "multiples" is a generic term for a class of different indicators that can be used to value a stock. A multiple is simply a ratio that is calculated by dividing the market or estimated value of an asset by a specific item on the financial statements. The multiples approach is a comparables analysis method that seeks to value similar companies using the same financial metrics.



An analyst using the valuation approach assumes that a particular ratio is applicable and applies to various companies operating within the same line of business or industry. In other words, the idea behind multiples analysis is that when firms are comparable, the multiples approach can be used to determine the value of one firm based on the value of another. The multiples approach seeks to capture many of a firm's operating and financial characteristics (e.g., expected growth) in a single number that can be multiplied by a specific financial metric (e.g., EBITDA) to yield an enterprise or equity value.


   Common Ratios Used in the Multiples Approach  

Enterprise value multiples and equity multiples are the two categories of valuation multiples. Enterprise value multiples include the enterprise-value-to-sales ratio (EV/sales), EV/EBIT, and EV/EBITDA. Equity multiples involve examining ratios between a company's share price and an element of the underlying company's performance, such as earnings, sales, book value, or something similar. Common equity multiples include price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, price-earnings to growth (PEG) ratio, price-to-book ratio (P/B), and price-to-sales (P/S) ratio.



Equity multiples can be artificially impacted by a change in capital structure, even when there is no change in enterprise value (EV). Since enterprise value multiples allow for direct comparison of different firms, regardless of capital structure, they are said to be better valuation models than equity multiples. Additionally, enterprise valuation multiples are typically less affected by accounting differences, since the denominator is computed higher up on the income statement. However, equity multiples are more commonly used by investors because they can be calculated easily and are readily available via most financial websites and newspapers.


   Using the Multiples Approach  

Investors start the multiples approach by identifying similar companies and evaluating their market values. A multiple is then computed for the comparable companies and aggregated into a standardized figure using a key statistics measure, such as the mean or median. The value identified as the key multiple among the various companies is applied to the corresponding value of the firm under analysis to estimate its value. When building a multiple, the denominator should use a forecast of profits, rather than historical profits.



Unlike backward-looking multiples, forward-looking multiples are consistent with the principles of valuation—in particular, that a company's value equals the present value of future cash flow, not past profits and sunk costs.


   Example of the Multiples Approach  

Let’s assume that an analyst wants to conduct the multiples approach to compare where major banking stocks trade in relation to their earnings. They can do this easily by creating a watchlist of the S&P 500's four largest banking stocks with each bank's P/E ratio, like in the example below:









Trailing 12-mo. P/E for Top 4 Banks (as of April 1, 2021)




 Bank
 Trailing P/E


 Wells Fargo
95.6


 Citigroup
15.4


Bank of America
20.8


JP Morgan Chase
17.2



Source: Yahoo! Finance



An analyst can quickly see that Citigroup Inc. (C) trades at a discount to the other three banks in relation to its earnings, having the lowest P/E ratio of the group at 15.4x. Wells Fargo, meanwhile, has a far larger P/E multiple nearing 100x, likely due to poor earnings that are expected to turn around. The P/E ratio mean, or average, of the four stocks is calculated by adding them together and dividing the number by four.



(95.6 + 15.4 + 20.8 + 17.2) / 4 = 37 average P/E ratio



The analyst now knows that Bank of America Corporation (BAC), JP Morgan (JPM), and Citigroup all trade at a discount to the major bank P/E ratio mean using the multiples approach.
What Is a Multiplier?  

In economics, a multiplier broadly refers to an economic factor that, when increased or changed, causes increases or changes in many other related economic variables. In terms of gross domestic product, the multiplier effect causes gains in total output to be greater than the change in spending that caused it.



The term multiplier is usually used in reference to the relationship between government spending and total national income. Multipliers are also used in explaining fractional reserve banking, known as the deposit multiplier.





Key Takeaways

A multiplier refers to an economic factor that, when applied, amplifies the effect of some other outcome.A multiplier value of 2x would therefore have the result of doubling some effect; 3x would triple it.Many examples of multipliers exist, such as the use of margin in trading or the money multiplier in fractional reserve banking.

   Explaining Multipliers  

A multiplier is simply a factor that amplifies or increase the base value of something else. A multiplier of 2x, for instance, would double the base figure. A multiplier of 0.5x, on the other hand, would actually reduce the base figure by half. Many different multipliers exist in finance and economics.


  The Fiscal Multiplier  

The fiscal multiplier is the ratio of a country's additional national income to the initial boost in spending or reduction in taxes that led to that extra income. For example, say that a national government enacts a $1 billion fiscal stimulus and that its consumers' marginal propensity to consume (MPC) is 0.75. Consumers who receive the initial $1 billion will save $250 million and spend $750 million, effectively initiating another, smaller round of stimulus. The recipients of that $750 million will spend $562.5 million, and so on.


  The Investment Multiplier  

An investment multiplier similarly refers to the concept that any increase in public or private investment has a more than proportionate positive impact on aggregate income and the general economy. The multiplier attempts to quantify the additional effects of a policy beyond those immediately measurable. The larger an investment's multiplier, the more efficient it is at creating and distributing wealth throughout an economy.


  The Earnings Multiplier  

The earnings multiplier frames a company's current stock price in terms of the company's earnings per share (EPS) of stock. It presents the stock's market value as a function of the company's earnings and is computed as price per share/earnings per share (commonly called the earnings multiple).


  The Equity Multiplier  

The equity multiplier is a commonly used financial ratio calculated by dividing a company's total asset value by total net equity. It is a measure of financial leverage. Companies finance their operations with equity or debt, so a higher equity multiplier indicates that a larger portion of asset financing is attributed to debt. The equity multiplier is thus a variation of the debt ratio, in which the definition of debt financing includes all liabilities.


   The Keynesian Multiplier Theory  

One popular multiplier theory and its equations were created by British economist John Maynard Keynes. Keynes believed that any injection of government spending created a proportional increase in overall income for the population, since the extra spending would carry through the economy. In his 1936 book, "The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money," Keynes wrote the following equation to describe the relationship between income (Y), consumption (C) and investment (I):


















Y


=


C


+


I
















where:
















Y


=


income
















C


=


consumption
















I


=


investment







\begin{aligned} &Y = C + I \\ &\textbf{where:}\\ &Y=\text{income}\\ &C=\text{consumption}\\ &I=\text{investment}\\ \end{aligned}


​Y=C+Iwhere:Y=incomeC=consumptionI=investment​



The equation states that for any level of income, people spend a fraction and save/invest the remainder. He further defined the marginal propensity to save and the marginal propensity to consume (MPC), using these theories to determine the amount of a given income that is invested. Keynes also showed that any amount used for investment would be consumed or reinvested many times over by different members of society.


   The Fractional Reserve Money Multiplier  

Assume a saver invests $100,000 in a savings account at his or her bank. Because the bank is only required to maintain a portion of that money on hand to cover deposits, it can loan out the remainder of the deposit to another party. Assume the bank loans out $75,000 of the initial deposit to a small construction company, which uses it to build a warehouse. Over time, if the bank continues to lend up to its required reserve ratio R=25%, the amount of additional demand deposits or “money” created by the initial deposit will be 1/R  or 1/.25 = 4 times, which is typically called the Money Multiplier.



The funds spent by the construction company go to pay electricians, plumbers, roofers, and various other parties to build it. These parties then go on to spend the funds they receive according to their own interests. The $100,000 has earned a return for the investor, the bank, the construction company, and the contractors that built the warehouse. Since Keynes' theory showed that investment was multiplied, increasing incomes for many parties, Keynes coined the term "multiplier" to describe the effect.



The deposit multiplier is frequently confused or thought to be synonymous with the money multiplier. However, although the two terms are closely related, they are not interchangeable. If banks loaned out all available capital beyond their required reserves, and if borrowers spent every dollar borrowed from banks, then the deposit multiplier and the money multiplier would be essentially the same.



In actual practice, the money multiplier, which designates the actual multiplied change in a nation's money supply created by loan capital beyond bank's reserves, is always less than the deposit multiplier, which can be seen as the maximum potential money creation through the multiplied effect of bank lending.
What Is the Multiplier Effect?  

The multiplier effect is an economic term, referring to the proportional amount of increase, or decrease, in final income that results from an injection, or withdrawal, of capital. In effect, Multipliers effects measure the impact that a change in economic activity—like investment or spending—will have on the total economic output of something. This amplified effect is known as the multiplier.





Key Takeaways

The multiplier effect is the proportional amount of increase or decrease in final income that results from an injection or withdrawal of spending.The most basic multiplier used in gauging the multiplier effect is calculated as the change in income divided by the change in spending and is used by companies to assess investment efficiency.The money supply multiplier, or just the money multiplier, looks at a multiplier effect from the perspective of banking and money supply.The money multiplier is a key concept in modern fractional reserve banking.Other multipliers include the deposit multiplier, fiscal multiplier, equity multiplier, and earnings multiplier.

   Understanding the Multiplier Effect  

Generally, economists are most interested in how infusions of capital positively affect income or growth. Many economists believe that capital investments of any kind—whether it be at the governmental or corporate level—will have a broad snowball effect on various aspects of economic activity.



As its name suggests, the multiplier effect provides a numerical value or estimate of a magnified expected increase in income per dollar of investment. In general, the multiplier used in gauging the multiplier effect is calculated as follows:












Multiplier


=



Change in Income


Change in Spending








\begin{aligned}\text{Multiplier}=\frac{\text{Change in Income}}{\text{Change in Spending}}\end{aligned}


Multiplier=Change in SpendingChange in Income​​



The multiplier effect can be seen in several different types of scenarios and used by a variety of different analysts when analyzing and estimating expectations for new capital investments.


   Example of the Multiplier Effect  

For example, assume a company makes a $100,000 investment of capital to expand its manufacturing facilities in order to produce more and sell more. After a year of production with the new facilities operating at maximum capacity, the company’s income increases by $200,000. This means that the multiplier effect was 2 ($200,000 / $100,000). Simply put, every $1 of investment produced an extra $2 of income.


   The Keynesian Multiplier  

Many economists believe that new investments can go far beyond just the effects of a single company’s income. Thus, depending on the type of investment, it may have widespread effects on the economy at large. A key tenet of Keynesian economic theory is that of the multiplier, the notion that economic activity can be easily influenced by investments, causing more income for companies, more income for workers, more supply, and ultimately greater aggregate demand.



Essentially, the Keynesian multiplier is a theory that states the economy will flourish the more the government spends, and the net effect is greater than the exact dollar amount spent. Different types of economic multipliers can be used to help measure the exact impact that changes in investment have on the economy.



For example, when looking at a national economy overall, the multiplier would be the change in real GDP divided by the change in investments, government spending, changes in income brought about by changes in disposable income through tax policy, or changes in investment spending resulting from monetary policy via changes in interest rates.



Some economists also like to factor in estimates for savings and consumption. This involves a slightly different type of multiplier. When looking at savings and consumption, economists might measure how much of the added income consumers are saving versus spending. If consumers save 20% of new income and spend 80% of new income, then their marginal propensity to consume (MPC) is 0.8. Using an MPC multiplier, the equation would be:


















MPC Multiplier


=



1

−


MPC




=

−


0.8




=


5
















where:
















MPC


=


Marginal propensity to consume







\begin{aligned}&\text{MPC Multiplier}=\frac{1}{1-\text{MPC}}=\frac{1}{1-0.8}=5\\&\textbf{where:}\\&\text{MPC}=\text{Marginal propensity to consume}\end{aligned}


​MPC Multiplier=1−MPC1​=1−0.81​=5where:MPC=Marginal propensity to consume​



Therefore, in this example, every new production dollar creates extra spending of $5.


   Money Supply Multiplier Effect  

Economists and bankers often look at a multiplier effect from the perspective of banking and a nation's money supply. This multiplier is called the money supply multiplier or just the money multiplier. The money multiplier involves the reserve requirement set by the Federal Reserve, and it varies based on the total amount of liabilities held by a particular depository institution.



In general, there are multiple levels of money supply across the entire U.S. economy. The most familiar ones are:



The first level, dubbed M1, refers to all of the physical currency in circulation within an economy.
The next level, called M2, adds the balances of short-term deposit accounts for a summation.



When a customer makes a deposit into a short-term deposit account, the banking institution can lend one minus the reserve requirement to someone else. While the original depositor maintains ownership of their initial deposit, the funds created through lending are generated based on those funds. If a second borrower subsequently deposits funds received from the lending institution, this raises the value of the money supply even though no additional physical currency actually exists to support the new amount.



The money supply multiplier effect can be seen in a country's banking system. An increase in bank lending should translate to an expansion of a country's money supply. The size of the multiplier depends on the percentage of deposits that banks are required to hold as reserves. When the reserve requirement decreases, the money supply reserve multiplier increases, and vice versa.






Back in 2020, prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Fed mandated that institutions with more than $127.5 million have reserves of 10% of their total deposits. However, as the pandemic sparked an economic crisis, the Fed took a dramatic step: On Mar. 26, 2020, it reduced the reserve ratio to 0%—essentially, eliminating these requirements entirely to free up liquidity.


  Money Supply Reserve Multiplier  

Most economists view the money multiplier in terms of reserve dollars and that is what the money multiplier formula is based on. Theoretically, this leads to a money (supply) reserve multiplier formula of:


















MSRM


=



1


RRR

















where:
















MSRM


=


Money supply reserve multiplier
















RRR


=


Reserve requirement ratio







\begin{aligned}&\text{MSRM}=\frac{1}{\text{RRR}}\\&\textbf{where:}\\&\text{MSRM}=\text{Money supply reserve multiplier}\\&\text{RRR}=\text{Reserve requirement ratio}\end{aligned}


​MSRM=RRR1​where:MSRM=Money supply reserve multiplierRRR=Reserve requirement ratio​



For example, in the case of banks with the highest required reserve requirement ratio—10% prior to COVID-19—their money supply reserve multiplier would be 10 (1 / 0.10). This means every one dollar of reserves should have $10 in money supply deposits.



If the reserve requirement is 10%, then the money supply reserve multiplier is 10 and the money supply should be 10 times reserves. When a reserve requirement is 10%, this also means that a bank can lend 90% of its deposits.


  Money Supply Reserve Multiplier Example  










Investopedia / Sabrina Jiang



Looking at the money multiplier in terms of reserves helps one to understand the amount of expected money supply. In this example, $651 equates to reserves of $65.13. If banks are efficiently using all of their deposits, lending out 90%, then reserves of $65 should result in a money supply of $651.



If banks are lending more than their reserve requirement allows, then their multiplier will be higher, creating more money supply. If banks are lending less, then their multiplier will be lower and the money supply will also be lower. Moreover, when 10 banks were involved in creating total deposits of $651.32, these banks generated a new money supply of $586.19, for a money supply increase of 90% of the deposits.


   Types of Multipliers  

A multiplier may occur in a variety of ways, impacting different instruments or balances. The most common types of multipliers are below.



The money multiplier demonstrates how central bank reserves are amplified by commercial banks
The deposit multiplier demonstrates how fractional reserve banking can amplify deposits through new loans
The fiscal multiplier measures the effect that increases in fiscal spending will have on a nation's economic output, or gross domestic product (GDP).
The investment multiplier quantifies the additional positive impact on aggregate income and the general economy generated from investment spending.
The earnings multiplier relates a company's current stock price to its per-share earnings.
The equity multiplier calculates how much of a company’s assets are financed by stock rather than debt.


   Impact of Multiplier Effect  

The multiplier effect as several implications on an economy. First, the multiplier effect often has a positive impact on the economy and economic growth. Instead of being limited to the actual quantity of funds in possession or in circulation, the multiplier effect can scale programs and allow for more efficient use of capital.



Multiplier effects may also impact economies in different ways. First, economies experience direct impacts when an economic factor is directly attributed to an entity. For example, when a government awards a tax incentive to an individual, that individual is said to have received the direct financial impact.



However, the multiplier effect incorporates two additional impacts: the indirect impact and the induced impact. The indirect impact of the government benefit above is that the individual takes their tax benefit and spends it. These funds do not sit idly by in one bank account; it may be spread across a dozen different businesses potentially relating to grocery stores, restaurants, car dealerships, or online purchases.



The last impact (induced impact) highlight the true benefit of multiple effects. Although a single individual received a tax benefit, many companies and their employees benefited. For example, imagine the individual dined at a restaurant and left a tip. That tip would now be the benefit of the waitstaff who may buy a crafted item at a local market and increase the income of a local artist. As currency flows through an economy, more than one individual or entity may residually receive benefit from a financial instrument. Therefore, the single tax benefit is said to have a multiplier effect on the economy.




What Is a Multiplier?
In economics, a multiplier broadly refers to an economic factor that, when changed, causes changes in many other related economic variables. The term is usually used in reference to the relationship between government spending and total national income. In terms of gross domestic product, the multiplier effect causes changes in total output to be greater than the change in spending that caused it.




How Does the Multiplier Effect Fit Into Keynesian Economics?
The multiplier effect is one of the chief components of Keynesian countercyclical fiscal policy. A key tenet of Keynesian economic theory is the notion that an injection of government spending eventually leads to added business activity and even more spending which boosts aggregate output and generates more income for companies. This would translate to more income for workers, more supply, and ultimately greater aggregate demand.




How Is the Multiplier Effect Related to MPC?
The magnitude of the multiplier is directly related to the marginal propensity to consume (MPC), which is defined as the proportion of an increase in income that gets spent on consumption. For example, if consumers save 20% of new income and spend the rest, then their MPC would be 0.8 (1 - 0.2). The multiplier would be 1 / (1 - 0.8) = 5. So, every new dollar creates extra spending of $5. Essentially, spending from one consumer becomes income for a business that then spends on equipment, worker wages, energy, materials, purchased services, taxes, and investor returns. When a worker from that business spends their income, it perpetuates the cycle.




Is a High Multiplier Good?
Each type of multiplier is individually defined and often has different metrics that define success. Very broadly speaking, most multipliers that are high indicate higher economic output or growth. For example, a higher money multiplier by banks often signals that currency is being cycled through an economy more times and more efficiently, often leading to greater economic growth.




What Causes the Multiplier Effect?
Some multiplier effects are simply the product of metric analysis as one number is compared to another. In other cases, the multiplier effect is a product of public policy or corporate governance. For example, the government may establish boundaries on how many times a deposit may be cycled through an economy. These regulations are often in place to restrict the multiplier effect; otherwise, financial institutions may become encumbered with too much risk.


   The Bottom Line  

Multiplier effects describe how small changes in financial resources (such as the money supply or bank deposits) can be amplified through modern economic processes, sometimes to great effect. John Maynard Keynes was among the first to describe how governments can use multipliers to stimulate economic growth through spending. In fractional reserve banking, the money multiplier (or deposit multiplier) effect shows how banks can re-lend a portion of the deposits on-hand to increase the amount of money in the economy. In this way, commercial banks have a large degree of influence on economic outcomes.
What Is the Mumbai Interbank Offered Rate (MIBOR)?  

The Mumbai Interbank Offer Rate (MIBOR) is one iteration of India's interbank rate, which is the rate of interest charged by a bank on a short-term loan to another bank. As India's financial markets have continued to develop, India felt it needed a reference rate for its debt market, which led to the development and introduction of the MIBOR. MIBOR is used in conjunction with the Mumbai interbank bid and forward rates (MIBID and MIFOR) by the central bank of India to set short-term monetary policy.





Key Takeaway

The Mumbai InterBank Overnight Rate, or MIBOR, is the overnight lending offered rate for Indian commercial banks.MIBOR is calculated based on input from a panel of 30 banks and primary dealers.MIBOR was first established in 1998, and modeled after the more famous London InterBank Overnight Rate (LIBOR).


   Understanding the Mumbai Interbank Offered Rate  

Banks borrow and lend money to one another on the interbank market in order to maintain appropriate, legal liquidity levels, and to meet reserve requirements placed on them by regulators. Interbank rates are made available only to the largest and most creditworthy financial institutions.



MIBOR is calculated every day by the National Stock Exchange of India (NSEIL) as a weighted average of lending rates of a group of major banks throughout India, on funds lent to first-class borrowers. This is the interest rate at which banks can borrow funds from other banks in the Indian interbank market.



The Mumbai Interbank Offer Rate (MIBOR) is modeled closely on London InterBank Overnight Rate (LIBOR). The rate is used currently for forward contracts and floating-rate debentures. Over time and with more use, MIBOR may become more significant.


   The History of MIBOR  

The MIBOR was launched on June 15, 1998, by the Committee for the Development of the Debt Market, as an overnight rate. The NSEIL launched the 14-day MIBOR on November 10, 1998, and the one-month and three-month MIBORs on December 1, 1998. Since the launch, MIBOR rates have been used as benchmark rates for the majority of money market deals made in India.


   MIBOR vs. MIBID  

The Mumbai Interbank Bid Rate (MIBID) is the interest rate that one participating bank would pay another to attract the deposit of funds. The MIBID rate would be lower than the interest rate offered to those wanting to borrow funds, known as Mumbai Interbank Offered Rate (MIBOR), one iteration of an interbank rate, which is the rate of interest charged by a bank on a short-term loan to another bank. This is to provide the bank a profit from the spread of interest earned and paid.



The MIBID is usually lower than the MIBOR because. Banks will try to pay less interest after taking loans and will try to get more interest while offering loans. Together, the MIBID and MIBOR constitute a bid-offer spread for Indian overnight lending rates.
What Is a Municipal Bond?  

The term “municipal bond” refers to a type of debt security issued by local, county, and state governments. They are commonly offered to pay for capital expenditures, including the construction of highways, bridges, or schools.



Municipal bonds act like loans, with bondholders becoming creditors. In exchange for borrowed capital, bondholders/investors are promised interest on their principal balance—the latter being repaid by the maturity date. Municipal bonds are often exempt from most taxes, which makes them attractive to people in higher income tax brackets.



Types of municipal bonds include general obligation and revenue bonds.





Key Takeaways

Municipal bonds (munis) are debt securities issued by state and local governments.These can be thought of as loans that investors make to local governments, and are used to fund public works such as parks, libraries, bridges and roads, and other infrastructure.Interest paid on municipal bonds is often tax free, making them an attractive investment option for individuals in high tax brackets.General obligation (GO) munis provide cash flows generated from taxes collected on a project.Revenue munis return cash flows generated from the project itself.


   Understanding Municipal Bonds  

A municipal bond is a debt obligation issued by a nonprofit organization, a private-sector corporation, or another public entity using the loan for public projects, such as constructing schools, hospitals, and highways.



Municipal bonds, which are also known as muni bonds or munis, can generate tax-free income for qualified residents but pay lower coupon (interest) rates as a result compared with taxable bonds.


   Types of Municipal Bonds  

A municipal bond is categorized based on the source of its interest payments and principal repayments. A bond can be structured in different ways, offering various benefits, risks, and tax treatments. Income generated by a municipal bond may be taxable. For example, a municipality may issue a bond not qualified for federal tax exemption, resulting in the generated income being subject to federal taxes.



A general obligation bond (GO) is issued by governmental entities and not backed by revenue from a specific project, such as a toll road. Some GO bonds are backed by dedicated property taxes; others are payable from general funds.
A revenue bond secures principal and interest payments through the issuer or via sales, fuel, hotel occupancy, or other taxes. When a municipality is a conduit issuer of bonds, a third party covers interest and principal payments.





$4 trillion

In 2021, the municipal bond market constituted about $4 trillion in assets outstanding.


   Municipal Bond Risks  

Default risk is low for municipal bonds compared with corporate bonds. However, revenue bonds are more vulnerable to changes in consumer tastes or general economic downturns than GO bonds. For example, a facility delivering water, treating sewage, or providing other fundamental services has more dependable revenue than a park’s rentable shelter area.



As a fixed-income security, the market price of a municipal bond fluctuates with changes in interest rates: When interest rates rise, bond prices decline; when interest rates decline, bond prices rise.



In addition, a bond with a longer maturity is more susceptible to interest rate changes than a bond with a shorter maturity, causing even greater changes in the municipal bond investor’s income. Furthermore, the majority of municipal bonds are illiquid; an investor needing immediate cash has to sell other securities instead.



Many municipal bonds carry call provisions, allowing the issuer to redeem the bond prior to the maturity date. An issuer typically calls a bond when interest rates drop and reissues municipal bonds at a lower interest rate. When a bond is called, investors lose income from interest payments and face reinvesting in a bond with a lower return.




What is the minimum amount you need to invest in municipal bonds?
Most municipal bonds are issued in $5,000 increments. Municipal bonds may be included in some exchange-traded funds (ETFs) as well as mutual funds, allowing investors to purchase bond fractions.




What term lengths are available for municipal bonds?
Municipal bonds are available in a variety of terms ranging from two to 30 years.




What are the benefits of a municipal bond?
Although municipal bonds may have lower interest rates than riskier investments like corporate bonds or stocks, they offer stability for your capital with low default rates. Interest from munis is also federally tax exempt, making it an attractive investment.
What Is the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (MSRB)?  

The Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (MSRB) is a regulating body that creates rules and policies for investment firms and banks in the issuing and sale of municipal bonds, notes, and other municipal securities. States, cities, and counties issue municipal securities for a variety of reasons.



Activities regulated by the MSRB include the underwriting, trading, and selling of municipal securities that are financing public projects. 





Key Takeaways

The Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board, (MSRB) is the primary regulator of municipal securities issued in the United States.The MSRB sets standards and best practices for both issuers and dealers of munis, as well as mandates transparency of information and disclosure on each issue.The MSRB is a self-regulatory organization that monitors its own members and their activities, subject to SEC oversight.


   Understanding the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board  

The Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board, (MS﻿RB) is a self-regulating organization (SRO) managed by a Board of Directors, with four committees that oversee specific aspects of the organization’s governance and operation. Like the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) or the National Association of Securities Dealers (NASD/FINRA), the MSRB sets its own rules and standards, but which are subject to ultimate supervision by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).﻿﻿



The U.S. Congress created the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board in 1975. It was given the assignment of creating rules and policies that would help prevent fraud and misleading acts in the securities industry. The MSRB was also designed to implement and support fair trading principles. In addition, it was tasked with creating and maintaining a system that would allow free and open trade in the securities market. One of its first accomplishments was creating a set of uniform standards dictating fair practices that municipal securities dealers should follow. The organization was also instrumental in paving the way for a smooth transition from traditional paper bonds to electronic versions in the 1980s. ﻿﻿


   Types of Municipal Securities the MSRB Oversees  

A municipal bond is categorized based on the source of its interest payments and principal repayments. A bond can be structured in different ways offering various benefits, risks and tax treatments. 



General Obligation (GO) backed by the creditworthiness of the issuer which has taxing power. Voter approval is prerequisite for issuance. These issues are the safest and yields tend to be lower as a result.
Revenue bonds are securitized by a specific revenue stream, such as tolls or other user fees. Because these bonds are riskier than general obligation bonds, their yields tend to be higher for similar maturities.
Short-term municipal bonds such as Tax Anticipation Notes (TANs), Revenue Anticipation Notes (RANs), Bond Anticipation Notes (BANs)
Exotic or Unique bonds are usually some variation on the earlier categories and include Certificates of Participation and Private Activity Bonds. These are generally part of a state or local government bond issue.


   Disclosure and the Regulatory Role of the MSRB  

In the 1980s, the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board played a central role in assisting the SEC in creating SEC Rule 15c2-12, which focuses on continuing disclosure. This ensures that issuers of municipal securities must agree to provide specific information to the MSRB on a regular basis about the investment securities they handle. This information includes annual financial reports and notices about events such as delinquencies, defaults, unscheduled draws on debt service reserves and any activities that would affect the tax-exempt status of the security.﻿﻿



This rule and related principles involving disclosures were prompted by an incident in 1983 in which the Washington Public Power Supply System defaulted on more than $2 billion in municipal bonds, representing one of the biggest and most costly municipal bond disasters in U.S. history.



More recently, the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board has served a role as a pioneer in helping to usher in the age of open electronic records in the securities industry. In the late 2000s, the MSRB launched the Electronic Municipal Market Access website, which provides free public access to information related to municipal bond trading, along with important disclosure documents.﻿﻿
What Is Murabaha?  

Murabaha, also referred to as cost-plus financing, is an Islamic financing structure in which the seller and buyer agree to the cost and markup of an asset. The markup takes place of interest, which is illegal in Islamic law. As such, murabaha is not an interest-bearing loan (qardh ribawi) but is an acceptable form of credit sale under Islamic law. As with a rent-to-own arrangement, the purchaser does not become the true owner until the loan is fully paid.





Key Takeaways

Interest-bearing loans are prohibited under Islam’s Sharia law.In Islamic finance, murabaha financing is used in place of loans.Murabaha is also referred to as cost-plus financing because it includes a profit markup in the transaction rather than interest.A seller and buyer agree to the cost and the markup, which are then paid in installments.


   Understanding Murabaha  

In a murabaha contract of sale, a client petitions a bank to purchase an item on their behalf. Complying with the client's request, the bank establishes a contract setting the cost and profit for the item, with repayment typically in installments. Because a set fee is charged rather than riba (interest), this type of loan is legal in Islamic countries. Islamic banks are prohibited from charging interest on loans according to the religious tenet that money is only a medium of exchange and has no inherent value; so banks must charge a flat fee for continuing daily operations. 



Many argue that this is simply another method of charging interest. However, the difference lies in the structure of the contract. In a murabaha contract for sale, the bank buys an asset and then sells the asset back to the client with a profit charge. This type of transaction is halal or valid, according to Islamic Sharia/Sharīʿah.






Issuing conventional loans and charging interest on them are considered interest-based activities, which are haram (prohibited) according to Islamic Sharīʿah.


   Murabaha and Default  

Additional charges may not be imposed after a murabaha due date, which makes murabaha default an increasing concern for Islamic banks. Many banks believe defaulters should be blacklisted and not allowed future loans from any Islamic bank as a method of decreasing murabaha default. Even if it is not expressly mentioned in the loan agreement, this arrangement is permissible in Sharia. If a debtor is facing a genuine hardship and cannot repay a loan on time, respite may be given as described in the Quran. However, the government may take action in cases of willful default. Defaults under murabaha arrangements have become a problem for companies operating under Islamic law and there has been no clear consensus on how to deal with them.


   Use of Murabaha  

The murabaha form of financing is typically used in place of loans in diverse sectors. For example, consumers use murabaha when purchasing household appliances, cars, or real estate. Businesses use this type of financing when purchasing machinery, equipment, or raw materials. Murabaha is also commonly used for a short-term trade, such as issuing letters of credit for importers.



A murabaha letter of credit is issued on behalf of an applicant (importer). The bank issuing the letter of credit agrees to pay an amount of money in compliance with the terms described in the letter of credit. Because the bank’s creditworthiness replaces that of the applicant, the beneficiary (exporter) is guaranteed payment. This benefits the exporter because the bank assumes the payment risk. Following the murabaha contract provisions, the importer is required to repay the bank for the cost of goods plus a profit markup amount.


   Example of Murabaha  

Bilal would like to buy a boat that sells for $100,000 from Billy's Boat Shop. To do so, Bilal would contact a murabaha bank, that would buy the boat from Billy's Boat Shop for $100,000 and sell it to Bilal for $109,000, to be paid in installments over a three year period. The amount Bilal pays is a fixed amount to a bank that owns the asset and there is no interest charge involved. Also, if Bilal defaults on any payments, there are no additional charges that he would incur. The additional amount Bilal pays over the cost price from the boat shop is in effect a 3% loan, but because it is offered as a fixed payment without any additional costs, it is allowed by Islamic law.
What Is Musharakah?  

Musharakah is a joint enterprise or partnership structure in Islamic finance in which partners share in the profits and losses of an enterprise. Since Islamic law (Sharia) does not permit profiting from interest in lending, musharakah allows for the financier of a project or company to achieve a return in the form of a portion of the actual profits according to a predetermined ratio. However, unlike a traditional creditor, the financier also will share in any losses should they occur, also on a pro rata basis. Musharakah is a type of shirkah al-amwal (or partnership), which in Arabic means "sharing."





Key Takeaways

Musharakah is a joint partnership arrangement in Islamic finance in which profits and losses are shared.Profits from interest are not permitted in Islamic practice, necessitating the need for musharakah.A permanent musharakah is often used for long-term financing needs since it has no specific end date and continues until the partners decide to dissolve it.


   Understanding Musharakah  

Musharakah plays a vital role in financing business operations based on Islamic principles. For example, suppose that individual A wants to start a business but has limited funds. Individual B has excess funds and wishes to be the financier in musharakah with A. The two people would come to an agreement to the terms and begin a business in which both share a portion of the profits and losses. This negates the need for A to receive a loan from B.



Musharakah is frequently used in the purchase of property and real estate, in providing credit, for investment projects, and to finance large purchases. In real estate deals, the partners request from a bank an assessment of the property's value via imputed rent (the sum a partner might pay to live in the property in question). Profits are divided between partners in predetermined ratios based on the value that was assigned and the sum of their different stakes. Every party that puts up capital is entitled to a say in the property's management. When musharakah is employed to finance large purchases, banks tend to lend by using floating-rate interest loans pegged to a company's rate of return. That peg serves as a lending partner's profit.






Musharakah are not binding contracts; either party can terminate the agreement unilaterally.


   Types of Musharakah  

Within musharakah, there are differing partnership arrangements. In a shirkah al-‘inan partnership, the partners are simply the agent and do not serve as guarantors of other partners. Shirkah al-mufawadah is an equal, unlimited, and unrestricted partnership in which all partners put in the same sum, share the same profit, and have the same rights.



A permanent musharakah has no specific end date and continues until the partners decide to dissolve it. As such, it is often used for long-term financing needs. A diminishing musharakah can have a few different structures. The first is a consecutive partnership, in which the share of each partner stays the same until the joint venture comes to an end. It is often used in project finance and especially home-buying.



In a diminishing partnership (also known as a declining balance partnership or declining musharakah), one partner's share is drawn down while it is transferred to another partner until the entire sum is passed over. Such a structure is common in home-buying where the lender (generally a bank) buys a property and receives payment from a buyer (via monthly rent payments) until the whole balance is paid off.



In the case of a default, both the buyer and lender get a share of the proceeds from the sale of the property on a pro rata basis. This differs from more traditional lending structures, which have the lender alone benefiting from any property sale following a foreclosure.
What Is a Mutual Company?  

A mutual company is a private firm that is owned by its customers or policyholders. The company's customers are also its owners. As such, they are entitled to receive a share of the profits generated by the mutual company.



The distribution of profits is typically made in the form of dividends paid on a pro rata basis, based on the amount of business each customer conducts with the mutual company. Alternately, some mutual companies choose to use their profits to reduce members' premiums.



A mutual company is sometimes referred to as a cooperative.


   How a Mutual Company Works  

The mutual company structure is commonly found in the insurance industry and sometimes in savings and loans associations. Many banking trusts and community banks in the U.S., as well as credit unions in Canada, also are structured as mutual companies.



The first mutual insurance company was formed in England in the 17th century. The word mutual was probably adopted to reflect the fact that the policyholder, or customer, was also the insurer, or part owner.





Key Takeaways

A mutual company is owned by its customers, who share in the profits.They are most often insurance companies.Each policyholder is entitled to a share of the profits, paid as a dividend or a reduced premium price.



The first insurance company in the U.S. was a mutual company, The Philadelphia Contributionship for the Insurance of Houses from Loss by Fire. It was founded in 1752 by none other than Benjamin Franklin.



Most institutions that are structured as mutual companies are private entities rather than publicly traded companies. In recent decades, many mutual companies in the U.S. and Canada have opted to change from a mutual structure to a joint stock corporate structure, a process known as demutualization. As part of this process, policyholders get a one-time award of stock in the newly-created joint stock corporation.



There is little substantive difference between the two corporate structures. A joint stock corporation is generally seen as more focused on short-term profit while a mutual company may prioritize strong cash reserves in case of unusual claims levels.


   Advantages of a Mutual Company  

A major selling point of mutual insurance companies is its shared ownership structure. Policyholders get some of the cost of their premiums back in the form of dividends or reduced premium prices.






Many mutual companies have changed to a joint stock corporate structure. This process is called demutualization.



For example, Lawyers' Mutual Insurance Co., a California-based company, recently paid a 10% dividend to its shareholders. It has paid dividends for 23 consecutive years.



As suggested by the name of that company, mutual companies often are specialized. They were formed by and for a group of professionals who often have common needs.
What Is a Mutual Fund?  

A mutual fund is a financial vehicle that pools assets from shareholders to invest in securities like stocks, bonds, money market instruments, and other assets. Mutual funds are operated by professional money managers, who allocate the fund's assets and attempt to produce capital gains or income for the fund's investors. A mutual fund's portfolio is structured and maintained to match the investment objectives stated in its prospectus.



Mutual funds give small or individual investors access to professionally managed portfolios of equities, bonds, and other securities. Each shareholder, therefore, participates proportionally in the gains or losses of the fund. Mutual funds invest in a vast number of securities, and performance is usually tracked as the change in the total market cap of the fund—derived by the aggregating performance of the underlying investments.



Most mutual funds are part of larger investment companies such as Fidelity Investments, Vanguard, T. Rowe Price, and Oppenheimer. A mutual fund has a fund manager, sometimes called its investment adviser, who is legally obligated to work in the best interest of mutual fund shareholders.





Key Takeaways

A mutual fund is a type of investment vehicle consisting of a portfolio of stocks, bonds, or other securities. Mutual funds give small or individual investors access to diversified, professionally managed portfolios.Mutual funds are divided into several kinds of categories, representing the kinds of securities they invest in, their investment objectives, and the type of returns they seek.Mutual funds charge annual fees, expense ratios, or commissions, which may affect their overall returns.Employer-sponsored retirement plans commonly invest in mutual funds.






   How Are Mutual Funds Priced?  

The value of the mutual fund depends on the performance of the securities in which it invests. When buying a unit or share of a mutual fund, an investor is buying the performance of its portfolio or, more precisely, a part of the portfolio's value. Investing in a share of a mutual fund is different from investing in shares of stock. Unlike stock, mutual fund shares do not give their holders any voting rights. A share of a mutual fund represents investments in many different stocks or other securities.



The price of a mutual fund share is referred to as the net asset value (NAV) per share, sometimes expressed as NAVPS. A fund's NAV is derived by dividing the total value of the securities in the portfolio by the total amount of shares outstanding. Outstanding shares are those held by all shareholders, institutional investors, and company officers or insiders.



Mutual fund shares can typically be purchased or redeemed at the fund's current NAV, which doesn't fluctuate during market hours, but is settled at the end of each trading day. The price of a mutual fund is also updated when the NAVPS is settled.



The average mutual fund holds different securities, which means mutual fund shareholders gain diversification. Consider an investor who buys only Google stock and relies on the success of the company's earnings. Because all of their dollars are tied to one company, gains and losses are dependent on the company's success. However, a mutual fund may hold Google in its portfolio where the gains and losses of just one stock are offset by gains and losses of other companies within the fund.


   How Are Returns Calculated for Mutual Funds?  

When an investor buys Apple stock, they are buying partial ownership or a share of the company. Similarly, a mutual fund investor is buying partial ownership of the mutual fund and its assets.



Investors typically earn a return from a mutual fund in three ways, usually on a quarterly or annual basis:



Income is earned from dividends on stocks and interest on bonds held in the fund's portfolio and pays out nearly all of the income it receives over the year to fund owners in the form of a distribution. Funds often give investors a choice either to receive a check for distributions or to reinvest the earnings to purchase additional shares of the mutual fund.
If the fund sells securities that have increased in price, the fund realizes a capital gain, which most funds also pass on to investors in a distribution.
When the fund's shares increase in price, you can then sell your mutual fund shares for a profit in the market.



When researching the returns of a mutual fund, an investor will see "total return," or the change in value, either up or down, of an investment over a specific period. This includes any interest, dividends, or capital gains the fund generated as well as the change in its market value over some time. In most cases, total returns are calculated for one, five, and 10-year periods as well as since the day the fund opened, or the inception date.


   Types of Mutual Funds  

There are several types of mutual funds available for investment, though most mutual funds fall into one of four main categories which include stock funds, money market funds, bond funds, and target-date funds.


  Stock Funds  

As the name implies, this fund invests principally in equity or stocks. Within this group are various subcategories. Some equity funds are named for the size of the companies they invest in: small-, mid-, or large-cap. Others are named by their investment approach: aggressive growth, income-oriented, value, and others. Equity funds are also categorized by whether they invest in domestic (U.S.) stocks or foreign equities. To understand the universe of equity funds is to use a style box, an example of which is below.



Funds can be classified based on both the size of the companies, their market caps, and the growth prospects of the invested stocks. The term value fund refers to a style of investing that looks for high-quality, low-growth companies that are out of favor with the market. These companies are characterized by low price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios, low price-to-book (P/B) ratios, and high dividend yields.



Conversely, growth funds, look to companies that have had strong growth in earnings, sales, and cash flows. These companies typically have high P/E ratios and do not pay dividends. A compromise between strict value and growth investment is a "blend," which simply refers to companies that are neither value nor growth stocks and are classified as being somewhere in the middle.

Large-cap companies have high market capitalizations, with values over $10 billion. Market cap is derived by multiplying the share price by the number of shares outstanding. Large-cap stocks are typically blue-chip firms that are often recognizable by name. Small-cap stocks refer to those stocks with a market cap ranging from $250 million to $2 billion. These smaller companies tend to be newer, riskier investments. Mid-cap stocks fill in the gap between small- and large-cap.



A mutual fund may blend its strategy between investment style and company size. For example, a large-cap value fund would look to large-cap companies that are in strong financial shape but have recently seen their share prices fall and would be placed in the upper left quadrant of the style box (large and value). The opposite of this would be a fund that invests in startup technology companies with excellent growth prospects: small-cap growth. Such a mutual fund would reside in the bottom right quadrant (small and growth).


  Bond Funds  

A mutual fund that generates a minimum return is part of the fixed income category. A fixed-income mutual fund focuses on investments that pay a set rate of return, such as government bonds, corporate bonds, or other debt instruments. The fund portfolio generates interest income, which is passed on to the shareholders.



Sometimes referred to as bond funds, these funds are often actively managed and seek to buy relatively undervalued bonds in order to sell them at a profit. These mutual funds are likely to pay higher returns and bond funds aren't without risk. For example, a fund specializing in high-yield junk bonds is much riskier than a fund that invests in government securities.



Because there are many different types of bonds, bond funds can vary dramatically depending on where they invest and all bond funds are subject to interest rate risk.


  Index Funds  

Index Funds invest in stocks that correspond with a major market index such as the S&P 500 or the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA). This strategy requires less research from analysts and advisors, so there are fewer expenses passed on to shareholders and these funds are often designed with cost-sensitive investors in mind.


  Balanced Funds  

Balanced funds invest in a hybrid of asset classes, whether stocks, bonds, money market instruments, or alternative investments. The objective of this fund, known as an asset allocation fund, is to reduce the risk of exposure across asset classes.



Some funds are defined with a specific allocation strategy that is fixed, so the investor can have a predictable exposure to various asset classes. Other funds follow a strategy for dynamic allocation percentages to meet various investor objectives. This may include responding to market conditions, business cycle changes, or the changing phases of the investor's own life.



The portfolio manager is commonly given the freedom to switch the ratio of asset classes as needed to maintain the integrity of the fund's stated strategy.


  Money Market Funds  

The money market consists of safe, risk-free, short-term debt instruments, mostly government Treasury bills. An investor will not earn substantial returns, but the principal is guaranteed. A typical return is a little more than the amount earned in a regular checking or savings account and a little less than the average certificate of deposit (CD).


  Income Funds  

Income funds are named for their purpose: to provide current income on a steady basis. These funds invest primarily in government and high-quality corporate debt, holding these bonds until maturity to provide interest streams. While fund holdings may appreciate, the primary objective of these funds is to provide steady cash flow​ to investors. As such, the audience for these funds consists of conservative investors and retirees.


  International/Global Funds  

An international fund, or foreign fund, invests only in assets located outside an investor's home country. Global funds, however, can invest anywhere around the world. Their volatility often depends on the unique country's economy and political risks. However, these funds can be part of a well-balanced portfolio by increasing diversification, since the returns in foreign countries may be uncorrelated with returns at home.


  Specialty Funds  

Sector funds are targeted strategy funds aimed at specific sectors of the economy, such as financial, technology, or healthcare. Sector funds can be extremely volatile since the stocks in a given sector tend to be highly correlated with each other.



Regional funds make it easier to focus on a specific geographic area of the world. This can mean focusing on a broader region or an individual country.



Socially responsible funds, or ethical funds, invest only in companies that meet the criteria of certain guidelines or beliefs. For example, some socially responsible funds do not invest in "sin" industries such as tobacco, alcoholic beverages, weapons, or nuclear power. Other funds invest primarily in green technology, such as solar and wind power or recycling.


   Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs)  

A twist on the mutual fund is the exchange-traded fund (ETF). They are not considered mutual funds but employ strategies consistent with mutual funds. They are structured as investment trusts that are traded on stock exchanges and have the added benefits of the features of stocks.



ETFs can be bought and sold throughout the trading day. ETFs can also be sold short or purchased on margin. ETFs also typically carry lower fees than the equivalent mutual fund. Many ETFs also benefit from active options markets, where investors can hedge or leverage their positions.



Compared to mutual funds, ETFs enjoy tax advantages. ETFs also tend to be more cost-efficient and liquid.


   Mutual Fund Fees  

A mutual fund has annual operating fees or shareholder fees. Annual fund operating fees are an annual percentage of the funds under management, usually ranging from 1–3%, known as the expense ratio. A fund's expense ratio is the summation of the advisory or management fee and its administrative costs.



Shareholder fees are sales charges, commissions, and redemption fees, that are paid directly by investors when purchasing or selling the funds. Sales charges or commissions are known as "the load" of a mutual fund. When a mutual fund has a front-end load, fees are assessed when shares are purchased. For a back-end load, mutual fund fees are assessed when an investor sells their shares.



Sometimes, however, an investment company offers a no-load mutual fund, which doesn't carry any commission or sales charge. These funds are distributed directly by an investment company, rather than through a secondary party. Some funds also charge fees and penalties for early withdrawals or selling the holding before a specific time has elapsed.


   Classes of Mutual Fund Shares  

Currently, most individual investors purchase mutual funds with A-shares through a broker. This purchase includes a front-end load of up to 5% or more, plus management fees and ongoing fees for distributions, also known as 12b-1 fees. Financial advisors selling these products may encourage clients to buy higher-load offerings to generate commissions. With front-end funds, the investor pays these expenses as they buy into the fund.



To remedy these problems and meet fiduciary-rule standards, investment companies have started designating new share classes, including "level load" C shares, which generally don't have a front-end load but carry a 12b-1 annual distribution fee of up to 1%.



Funds that charge management and other fees when an investor sells their holdings are classified as Class B shares.


   Pros of Mutual Fund Investing  

There are a variety of reasons that mutual funds have been the retail investor's vehicle of choice with an overwhelming majority of money in employer-sponsored retirement plans invested in mutual funds.


  Diversification  

Diversification, or the mixing of investments and assets within a portfolio to reduce risk, is one of the advantages of investing in mutual funds. A diversified portfolio has securities with different capitalizations and industries and bonds with varying maturities and issuers. Buying a mutual fund can achieve diversification cheaper and faster than buying individual securities.


  Easy Access  

Trading on the major stock exchanges, mutual funds can be bought and sold with relative ease, making them highly liquid investments. Also, when it comes to certain types of assets, like foreign equities or exotic commodities, mutual funds are often the most feasible way—in fact, sometimes the only way—for individual investors to participate.


  Economies of Scale  

Mutual funds also provide economies of scale by forgoing numerous commission charges needed to create a diversified portfolio. Buying only one security at a time leads to large transaction fees. The smaller denominations of mutual funds allow investors to take advantage of dollar-cost averaging.



Because a mutual fund buys and sells large amounts of securities at a time, its transaction costs are lower than what an individual would pay for securities transactions. A mutual fund can invest in certain assets or take larger positions than a smaller investor could.


  Professional Management  

A professional investment manager uses careful research and skillful trading. A mutual fund is a relatively inexpensive way for a small investor to get a full-time manager to make and monitor investments. Mutual funds require much lower investment minimums so these funds provide a low-cost way for individual investors to experience and benefit from professional money management.


  Variety and Freedom of Choice  

Investors have the freedom to research and select from managers with a variety of styles and management goals. A fund manager may focus on value investing, growth investing, developed markets, emerging markets, income, or macroeconomic investing, among many other styles. This variety allows investors to gain exposure to not only stocks and bonds but also commodities, foreign assets, and real estate through specialized mutual funds. Mutual funds provide opportunities for foreign and domestic investment that may not otherwise be directly accessible to ordinary investors.


  Transparency  

Mutual funds are subject to industry regulation that ensures accountability and fairness to investors.

   Cons of Mutual Fund Investing  

Liquidity, diversification, and professional management all make mutual funds attractive options, however, mutual funds have drawbacks too.


  No Guarantees  

Like many other investments without a guaranteed return, there is always the possibility that the value of your mutual fund will depreciate. Equity mutual funds experience price fluctuations, along with the stocks in the fund's portfolio. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) does not guarantee mutual fund investments.


  Cash Drag  

Mutual funds require a significant amount of their portfolios to be held in cash to satisfy share redemptions each day. To maintain liquidity and the capacity to accommodate withdrawals, funds typically have to keep a larger portion of their portfolio as cash than a typical investor might. Because cash earns no return, it is often referred to as a "cash drag."


  High Costs  

Mutual funds provide investors with professional management, but fees reduce the fund's overall payout, and they're assessed to mutual fund investors regardless of the performance of the fund. Since fees vary widely from fund to fund, failing to pay attention to the fees can have negative long-term consequences as actively managed funds incur transaction costs that accumulate over each year.


  "Diworsification" and Dilution  

"Diworsification"—a play on words—is an investment or portfolio strategy that implies too much complexity can lead to worse results. Many mutual fund investors tend to overcomplicate matters. That is, they acquire too many funds that are highly related and, as a result, lose the benefits of diversification.



Dilution is also the result of a successful fund growing too big. When new money pours into funds that have had strong track records, the manager often has trouble finding suitable investments for all the new capital to be put to good use.



The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) requires that funds have at least 80% of assets in the particular type of investment implied in their names. How the remaining assets are invested is up to the fund manager. However, the different categories that qualify for the required 80% of the assets may be vague and wide-ranging. A fund can, therefore, manipulate prospective investors via its title. A fund that focuses narrowly on Congolese stocks, for example, could be sold with a far-ranging title like "International High-Tech Fund."


  End of Day Trading Only  

A mutual fund allows you to request that your shares be converted into cash at any time, however, unlike stock that trades throughout the day, many mutual fund redemptions​ take place only at the end of each trading day.


  Taxes  

When a fund manager sells a security, a capital-gains tax is triggered. Taxes can be mitigated by investing in tax-sensitive funds or by holding non-tax-sensitive mutual funds in a tax-deferred account, such as a 401(k) or IRA.


  Evaluating Funds  

Researching and comparing funds can be difficult. Unlike stocks, mutual funds do not offer investors the opportunity to juxtapose the price to earnings (P/E) ratio, sales growth, earnings per share (EPS), or other important data. A mutual fund's net asset value can offer some basis for comparison, but given the diversity of portfolios, comparing the proverbial apples to apples can be difficult, even among funds with similar names or stated objectives. Only index funds tracking the same markets tend to be genuinely comparable.


   Example of a Mutual Fund  

One of the most notable mutual funds is Fidelity Investments' Magellan Fund (FMAGX). Established in 1963, the fund had an investment objective of capital appreciation via investment in common stocks. The fund's height of success was between 1977 and 1990 when Peter Lynch served as its portfolio manager. Under Lynch's tenure, Magellan's assets under management increased from $18 million to $14 billion.



Fidelity's performance continued strong, and assets under management (AUM) grew to nearly $110 billion in 2000. By 1997, the fund had become so large that Fidelity closed it to new investors and would not reopen it until 2008.



As of March 2022, Fidelity Magellan has nearly $28 billion in assets and has been managed by Sammy Simnegar since Feb. 2019. The fund's performance has tracked or slightly surpassed that of the S&P 500.




Are Mutual Funds a Safe Investment?
All investments involve some degree of risk when purchasing securities such as stocks, bonds, or mutual funds. Unlike deposits at FDIC-insured banks and NCUA-insured credit unions, the money invested in securities typically is not federally insured.




Can Mutual Fund Shares Be Sold at Any Time?
Mutual funds are considered liquid assets and shares can be sold at any time, however, review the fund's policies regarding exchange fees or redemption fees. There may also be tax implications for capital gains earned with a mutual fund redemption.




What Is a Target Date Mutual Fund?
When investing in a 401(k) or other retirement savings account, target-date funds, or life-cycle funds, are a popular option. Choosing a fund that is dated around retirement, like FUND X 2050, the fund promises to rebalance and shift the risk profile of its investments, commonly to a more conservative approach, as the fund approaches the target date.
What Is a Mutual Insurance Company?  

A mutual insurance company is an insurance company that is owned by policyholders. The sole purpose of a mutual insurance company is to provide insurance coverage for its members and policyholders, and its members are given the right to select management. Mutual insurance companies make investments in portfolios like a regular mutual fund, with any profits returned to members as dividends or a reduction in premiums. Federal law, rather than state law, determines whether an insurer can be classified as a mutual insurance company.





Key Takeaways

An insurance company owned by its policyholders is a mutual insurance company.A mutual insurance company provides insurance coverage to its members and policyholders at or near cost.Any profits from premiums and investments are distributed to its members via dividends or a reduction in premiums.Mutual insurance companies are not listed on stock exchanges, but if they eventually decide to be, they are "demutualized."Federal law determines whether an insurer can be a mutual insurance company.


   Understanding a Mutual Insurance Company  

The goal of a mutual insurance company is to provide its members with insurance coverage at or near cost. When a mutual insurance company has profits, those profits are distributed to members via a dividend payment or a reduction in premiums.



Mutual insurance companies are not traded on stock exchanges, therefore their investment strategy avoids the pressure of having to reach short-term profit targets and can operate as best suited to its members with the goal of long-term benefits. As a result, they invest in safer, low-yield assets. However, because they are not publicly traded, it can be more difficult for policyholders to determine how financially solvent a mutual insurance company is, or how it calculates dividends it sends back to its members.



Large companies can form a mutual insurance company as a form of self-insurance, either by combining divisions with separate budgets or by teaming up with other similar companies. For example, a group of physicians may decide that they can get better insurance coverage and lower premiums by pooling funds to cover their similar risk types.



When a mutual insurance company switches from being member-owned to being traded on the stock market, it is called “demutualization,” and the mutual insurance company becomes a stock insurance company. This shift may result in policyholders gaining shares in the newly floated company. Most often this is done as a form of raising capital. Stock insurance companies can raise capital by distributing shares, whereas mutual insurance companies can only raise capital by borrowing money or increasing rates.


   History of Mutual Insurance Companies  

Mutual insurance as a concept began in England in the late 17th century to cover losses due to fire. It began in the United States in 1752 when Benjamin Franklin established the Philadelphia Contributionship for the Insurance of Houses From Loss by Fire. Mutual insurance companies now exist nearly everywhere around the world.



In the past 20 years, the insurance industry has gone through major changes, particularly after 1990s-era legislation removed some of the barriers between insurance companies and banks. As such, the rate of demutualization increased as many mutual companies wanted to diversify their operations beyond insurance, and to access more capital.



Some companies converted completely to stock ownership, while others formed mutual holding companies that are owned by the policyholders of a converted mutual insurance firm.
What Is Mutually Exclusive?  

Mutually exclusive is a statistical term describing two or more events that cannot happen simultaneously. It is commonly used to describe a situation where the occurrence of one outcome supersedes the other. For example, war and peace cannot coexist at the same time. This makes them mutually exclusive.





Key Takeaways

Events are considered to be mutually exclusive when they cannot happen at the same time.The concept often comes up in the business world in the assessment of budgeting and dealmaking.If considering mutually exclusive options, a company must weigh the opportunity cost, or what it would be giving up by choosing each option.The time value of money (TVM) is often considered when deciding between two mutually exclusive choices.Not mutually exclusive means that two instances or outcomes can occur simultaneously, and one outcome does not limit the other from being possible. 


   Understanding Mutually Exclusive  

Mutually exclusive events are events that can't both happen, but should not be considered independent events. Independent events have no impact on the viability of other options. For a basic example, consider the rolling of dice. You cannot roll both a five and a three simultaneously on a single die. However, you absolutely can roll a five and a three on two dice. Rolling a five and three simultaneously means this outcome is mutually exclusive. Rolling a five on one and a three on the other means they are not mutually exclusive outcomes.


  Opportunity Cost  

When faced with a choice between mutually exclusive options, a company must consider the opportunity cost, which is what the company would be giving up to pursue each option. The concepts of opportunity cost and mutual exclusivity are inherently linked because each mutually exclusive option requires the sacrifice of whatever profits could have been generated by choosing the alternate option.



The time value of money (TVM) and other factors make mutually exclusive analysis a bit more complicated. For a more comprehensive comparison, companies use the net present value (NPV) and internal rate of return (IRR) formulas to mathematically determine which project is most beneficial when choosing between two or more mutually exclusive options.


   Example of Mutually Exclusive  

The concept of mutual exclusivity is often applied in capital budgeting. Companies may have to choose between multiple projects that will add value to the company upon completion. Some of these projects are mutually exclusive.



For example, assume a company has a budget of $50,000 for expansion projects. If available Projects A and B each cost $40,000 and Project C costs only $10,000, then Projects A and B are mutually exclusive. If the company pursues A, it cannot also afford to pursue B and vice versa. Project C may be considered independent. Regardless of which other project is pursued, the company can still afford to pursue C as well. The acceptance of either A or B does not impact the viability of C, and the acceptance of C does not impact the viability of either of the other projects.



Moreover, when looking at opportunity costs, consider the analysis of Projects A and B. Assume that Project A has a potential return of $100,000, while Project B will only return $80,000. Since A and B are mutually exclusive, the opportunity cost of choosing B is equal to the profit of the most lucrative option (in this case, A) minus the profits generated by the selected option (B); that is, $100,000 - $80,000 = $20,000. Because option A is the most lucrative option, the opportunity cost of going for option A is $0.




What Does It Mean If Projects Are Mutually Exclusive?
In business, managers and directors often need to plan resource allocation. If a company is building a bridge and a skyscraper, and both projects require an extremely specialized piece of equipment and only one exists in the world, it would mean that these projects are mutually exclusive, as that piece of equipment cannot be used by both projects at the same time. This idea can be extended to consider specialized professionals, software systems (which cannot run both Mac and Windows), and allocated budgets.




What Is the Difference Between Independent and Mutually Exclusive?
To illustrate the difference between what is independent and what is mutually exclusive, consider the war and peace example from earlier. There could be war in France and peace in Italy. These are two independent nations and therefore each one could be in its own state of peace. However, there cannot be war in France and peace in France. Since they cannot coexist, that makes them mutually exclusive.




What Does Mutually Exclusive Mean in Finance?
Typically, this involves budgeting and payments. If a company has $180 million to spend, it cannot spend that $180 million both by reinvesting in the business and offering bonuses to upper management. In this case, those two options are mutually exclusive. If the company can only retain licensing in a single country, that means they should not attempt to be licensed in two separate countries as they are mutually exclusive.


   The Bottom Line  

Things that are mutually exclusive are not able to occur simultaneously. In business, this is typically concerning the undertaking of projects or allocating a budget. If two things are not mutually exclusive, it means the existence and occurrence of one does not necessarily mean the other cannot coexist.
