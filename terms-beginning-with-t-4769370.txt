What Is T+1 (T+2, T+3)?  

T+1 (T+2, T+3) are abbreviations that refer to the settlement date of security transactions. The "T" stands for transaction date, which is the day the transaction takes place. The numbers 1, 2, or 3 denote how many days after the transaction date the settlement—or the transfer of money and security ownership—takes place.





Key Takeaways

T+1 (or T+2, T+3) are abbreviations that refer to the settlement date of transactions.The letter "T" indicates the transaction date; the numbers 1, 2, or 3 denote how many days after the transaction date the settlement takes place.Stocks are usually T+2 and bonds, mutual funds, and money market funds vary among T+1, T+2, and T+3.


   Understanding T+1 (T+2, T+3)  

For determining the T+1 (T+2, T+3) settlement date, the only days counted are those on which the stock market is open. T+1 means that if a transaction occurs on a Monday, settlement must occur by Tuesday. Likewise, T+3 means that a transaction occurring on a Monday must be settled by Thursday, assuming no holidays occur between these days. But if you sell a security with a T+3 settlement date on a Friday, ownership and money transfer do not have to take place until the following Wednesday.



Knowing the settlement date of a stock is also important for investors or strategic traders who are interested in dividend-paying companies because the settlement date can determine which party receives the dividend. That is, the trade must settle before the record date for the dividend in order for the stock buyer to receive the dividend.






Note that the period between transaction and settlement is not flex time in which an investor can back out of a deal. The deal is done on the transaction day—it's only the transfer that does not take place until later.



In the past, security transactions were done manually rather than electronically. Investors would have to wait for the delivery of a particular security, which was an actual certificate, and they would not pay until receipt. Since delivery times could vary and prices could fluctuate, market regulators set a period of time in which securities and cash must be delivered.



Many years ago, the settlement date for stocks was T+5, or five business days after the transaction date. Until recently, settlement was set at T+3. Today, it's T+2 (i.e., two business days after the transaction date).



Settlement dates vary, according to the type of security. All stocks are currently T+2; however, bonds, mutual funds, and some money market funds will vary between T+1, T+2, and T+3.



The SEC has recently introduced a proposal to shorten stock and ETF settlement to T+1. If approved, the new rules would be in place by some time in 2024.






The settlement date is the date on which the investor becomes a shareholder of record. Weekends and public holidays are not included in the day count.


   Example of T+1 (T+2, T+3)  

As an example of how T+1 (T+2, T+3) settlement dates work, consider an investor who buys shares of Microsoft (MSFT) on Monday, April 5. While the broker would debit the investor's account for the total cost of the investment immediately after the order is filled, the investor's status as a shareholder of Microsoft will not be settled in the company's record books until Wednesday, April 7.

What Is a T-Distribution?  

The t-distribution, also known as the Student’s t-distribution, is a type of probability distribution that is similar to the normal distribution with its bell shape but has heavier tails. It is used for estimating population parameters for small sample sizes or unknown variances. T-distributions have a greater chance for extreme values than normal distributions, and as a result have fatter tails.



The t-distribution is the basis for computing t-tests in statistics.





Key Takeaways

The t-distribution is a continuous probability distribution of the z-score when the estimated standard deviation is used in the denominator rather than the true standard deviation.The t-distribution, like the normal distribution, is bell-shaped and symmetric, but it has heavier tails, which means that it tends to produce values that fall far from its mean.T-tests are used in statistics to estimate significance.


   What Does a T-Distribution Tell You?   

Tail heaviness is determined by a parameter of the t-distribution called degrees of freedom, with smaller values giving heavier tails, and with higher values making the t-distribution resemble a standard normal distribution with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.

When a sample of n observations is taken from a normally distributed population having mean M and standard deviation D, the sample mean, m, and the sample standard deviation, d, will differ from M and D because of the randomness of the sample.



A z-score can be calculated with the population standard deviation as Z = (x – M)/D, and this value has the normal distribution with mean 0 and standard deviation 1. But when using the estimated standard deviation, a t-score is calculated as T = (m – M)/{d/sqrt(n)}, and the difference between d and D makes the distribution a t-distribution with (n - 1) degrees of freedom rather than the normal distribution with mean 0 and standard deviation 1. 


   Example of How to Use a T-Distribution  

Take the following example for how t-distributions are put to use in statistical analysis. First, remember that a confidence interval for the mean is a range of values, calculated from the data, meant to capture a “population” mean. This interval is m +- t*d/sqrt(n), where t is a critical value from the t-distribution.



For instance, a 95% confidence interval for the mean return of the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) in the 27 trading days prior to Sept. 11, 2001, is -0.33%, (+/- 2.055) * 1.07 / sqrt(27), giving a (persistent) mean return as some number between -0.75% and +0.09%. The number 2.055, the amount of standard errors to adjust by, is found from the t-distribution.






Because the t-distribution has fatter tails than a normal distribution, it can be used as a model for financial returns that exhibit excess kurtosis, which will allow for a more realistic calculation of Value at Risk (VaR) in such cases.


   T-Distribution vs. Normal Distribution   

Normal distributions are used when the population distribution is assumed to be normal. The t-distribution is similar to the normal distribution, just with fatter tails. Both assume a normally distributed population. T-distributions thus have higher kurtosis than normal distributions. The probability of getting values very far from the mean is larger with a t-distribution than a normal distribution.















Normal vs. t-distribution.


   Limitations of Using a T-Distribution   

The t-distribution can skew exactness relative to the normal distribution. Its shortcoming only arises when there’s a need for perfect normality. The t-distribution should only be used when the population standard deviation is not known. If the population standard deviation is known and the sample size is large enough, the normal distribution should be used for better results.




What is the t-distribution in statistics?
The t-distribution is used in statistics to estimate the population parameters for small sample sizes or undetermined variances. It is also referred to as the Student’s t-distribution.




When should the t-distribution be used?
The t-distribution should be used if the population sample size is small and the standard deviation is unknown. If not, then the normal distribution should be used.




What does normal distribution mean?
Normal distribution is a term for a probability bell curve. It is also called the Gaussian distribution.


   The Bottom Line  

The t-distribution is used in statistics to estimate the significance of population parameters for small sample sizes or unknown variations. Like the normal distribution, it is bell-shaped and symmetric. Unlike normal distributions, it has heavier tails, which result in a greater chance for extreme values.
What is a T-Account?  

A T-account is an informal term for a set of financial records that uses double-entry bookkeeping. The term describes the appearance of the bookkeeping entries. First, a large letter T is drawn on a page. The title of the account is then entered just above the top horizontal line, while underneath debits are listed on the left and credits are recorded on the right, separated by the vertical line of the letter T.



A T-account is also called a ledger account.


   Understanding T-Account  

In double-entry bookkeeping, a widespread accounting method, all financial transactions are considered to affect at least two of a company's accounts. One account will get a debit entry, while the second will get a credit entry to record each transaction that occurs. 



The credits and debits are recorded in a general ledger, where all account balances must match. The visual appearance of the ledger journal of individual accounts resembles a T-shape, hence why a ledger account is also called a T-account.



A T-account is the graphical representation of a general ledger that records a business’ transactions. It consists of the following:



An account title at the top horizontal line of the TA debit side on the leftA credit side on the right





Key Takeaways

A T-account is an informal term for a set of financial records that use double-entry bookkeeping.It is called a T-account because the bookkeeping entries are laid out in a way that resembles a T-shape.The account title appears just above the T. Underneath, debits are listed on the left and credits are recorded on the right, separated by a line.The T-account guides accountants on what to enter in a ledger to get an adjusting balance so that revenues equal expenses. 


   Example of T-Account  

If Barnes & Noble Inc. sold $20,000 worth of books, it will debit its cash account $20,000 and credit its books or inventory account $20,000. This double-entry system shows that the company now has $20,000 more in cash and a corresponding $20,000 less in inventory on its books. The T-account will look like this:

   T- Account Recording  

For different accounts, debits and credits may translate to increases or decreases, but the debit side must always lie to the left of the T outline and the credit entries must be recorded on the right side. The major components of the balance sheet—assets, liabilities and shareholders’ equity (SE)—can be reflected in a T-account after any financial transaction occurs. 



The debit entry of an asset account translates to an increase to the account, while the right side of the asset T-account represents a decrease to the account. This means that a business that receives cash, for example, will debit the asset account, but will credit the account if it pays out cash. 



The liability and shareholders’ equity (SE) in a T-account have entries on the left to reflect a decrease to the accounts and any credit signifies an increase to the accounts. A company that issues shares worth $100,000 will have its T-account show an increase in its asset account and a corresponding increase in its equity account:

T-accounts can also be used to record changes to the income statement, where accounts can be set up for revenues (profits) and expenses (losses) of a firm. For the revenue accounts, debit entries decrease the account, while a credit record increases the account. On the other hand, a debit increases an expense account, and a credit decreases it.


   T-Account Advantages  

T-accounts are commonly used to prepare adjusting entries. The matching principle in accrual accounting states that all expenses must match with revenues generated during the period. The T-account guides accountants on what to enter in a ledger to get an adjusting balance so that revenues equal expenses.



A business owner can also use T-accounts to extract information, such as the nature of a transaction that occurred on a particular day or the balance and movements of each account.
What Is a T-Test?  

A t-test is an inferential statistic used to determine if there is a significant difference between the means of two groups and how they are related. T-tests are used when the data sets follow a normal distribution and have unknown variances, like the data set recorded from flipping a coin 100 times.



The t-test is a test used for hypothesis testing in statistics and uses the t-statistic, the t-distribution values, and the degrees of freedom to determine statistical significance.





Key Takeaways

A t-test is an inferential statistic used to determine if there is a statistically significant difference between the means of two variables.The t-test is a test used for hypothesis testing in statistics.Calculating a t-test requires three fundamental data values including the difference between the mean values from each data set, the standard deviation of each group, and the number of data values.T-tests can be dependent or independent.

   Understanding the T-Test  

A t-test compares the average values of two data sets and determines if they came from the same population. In the above examples, a sample of students from class A and a sample of students from class B would not likely have the same mean and standard deviation. Similarly, samples taken from the placebo-fed control group and those taken from the drug prescribed group should have a slightly different mean and standard deviation.



Mathematically, the t-test takes a sample from each of the two sets and establishes the problem statement. It assumes a null hypothesis that the two means are equal.



Using the formulas, values are calculated and compared against the standard values. The assumed null hypothesis is accepted or rejected accordingly. If the null hypothesis qualifies to be rejected, it indicates that data readings are strong and are probably not due to chance.



The t-test is just one of many tests used for this purpose. Statisticians use additional tests other than the t-test to examine more variables and larger sample sizes. For a large sample size, statisticians use a z-test. Other testing options include the chi-square test and the f-test.


   Using a T-Test  

Consider that a drug manufacturer tests a new medicine. Following standard procedure, the drug is given to one group of patients and a placebo to another group called the control group. The placebo is a substance with no therapeutic value and serves as a benchmark to measure how the other group, administered the actual drug, responds.



After the drug trial, the members of the placebo-fed control group reported an increase in average life expectancy of three years, while the members of the group who are prescribed the new drug reported an increase in average life expectancy of four years.



Initial observation indicates that the drug is working. However, it is also possible that the observation may be due to chance. A t-test can be used to determine if the results are correct and applicable to the entire population.



Four assumptions are made while using a t-test. The data collected must follow a continuous or ordinal scale, such as the scores for an IQ test, the data is collected from a randomly selected portion of the total population, the data will result in a normal distribution of a bell-shaped curve, and equal or homogenous variance exists when the standard variations are equal.


   T-Test Formula  

Calculating a t-test requires three fundamental data values. They include the difference between the mean values from each data set, or the mean difference, the standard deviation of each group, and the number of data values of each group.



This comparison helps to determine the effect of chance on the difference, and whether the difference is outside that chance range. The t-test questions whether the difference between the groups represents a true difference in the study or merely a random difference.



The t-test produces two values as its output: t-value and degrees of freedom. The t-value, or t-score, is a ratio of the difference between the mean of the two sample sets and the variation that exists within the sample sets.



The numerator value is the difference between the mean of the two sample sets. The denominator is the variation that exists within the sample sets and is a measurement of the dispersion or variability.



This calculated t-value is then compared against a value obtained from a critical value table called the T-distribution table. Higher values of the t-score indicate that a large difference exists between the two sample sets. The smaller the t-value, the more similarity exists between the two sample sets.





T-Score

A large t-score, or t-value, indicates that the groups are different while a small t-score indicates that the groups are similar.



Degrees of freedom refer to the values in a study that has the freedom to vary and are essential for assessing the importance and the validity of the null hypothesis. Computation of these values usually depends upon the number of data records available in the sample set.


  Paired Sample T-Test  

The correlated t-test, or paired t-test, is a dependent type of test and is performed when the samples consist of matched pairs of similar units, or when there are cases of repeated measures. For example, there may be instances where the same patients are repeatedly tested before and after receiving a particular treatment. Each patient is being used as a control sample against themselves.



This method also applies to cases where the samples are related or have matching characteristics, like a comparative analysis involving children, parents, or siblings.



The formula for computing the t-value and degrees of freedom for a paired t-test is:

  Unequal Variance T-Test

   Example of an Unequal Variance T-Test  

Assume that the diagonal measurement of paintings received in an art gallery is taken. One group of samples includes 10 paintings, while the other includes 20 paintings. The data sets, with the corresponding mean and variance values, are as follows:










 
Set 1
Set 2




 
19.7
28.3

13.3


Mean
19.4
21.6


Variance
1.4
17.1






Though the mean of Set 2 is higher than that of Set 1, we cannot conclude that the population corresponding to Set 2 has a higher mean than the population corresponding to Set 1.



Is the difference from 19.4 to 21.6 due to chance alone, or do differences exist in the overall populations of all the paintings received in the art gallery? We establish the problem by assuming the null hypothesis that the mean is the same between the two sample sets and conduct a t-test to test if the hypothesis is plausible.



Since the number of data records is different (n1 = 10 and n2 = 20) and the variance is also different, the t-value and degrees of freedom are computed for the above data set using the formula mentioned in the Unequal Variance T-Test section.



The t-value is -2.24787. Since the minus sign can be ignored when comparing the two t-values, the computed value is 2.24787.



The degrees of freedom value is 24.38 and is reduced to 24, owing to the formula definition requiring rounding down of the value to the least possible integer value.



One can specify a level of probability (alpha level, level of significance, p) as a criterion for acceptance. In most cases, a 5% value can be assumed.



Using the degree of freedom value as 24 and a 5% level of significance, a look at the t-value distribution table gives a value of 2.064. Comparing this value against the computed value of 2.247 indicates that the calculated t-value is greater than the table value at a significance level of 5%. Therefore, it is safe to reject the null hypothesis that there is no difference between means. The population set has intrinsic differences, and they are not by chance.




How Is the T-Distribution Table Used?
The T-Distribution Table is available in one-tail and two-tails formats. The former is used for assessing cases that have a fixed value or range with a clear direction, either positive or negative. For instance, what is the probability of the output value remaining below -3, or getting more than seven when rolling a pair of dice? The latter is used for range-bound analysis, such as asking if the coordinates fall between -2 and +2.




What Is an Independent T-Test?
The samples of independent t-tests are selected independent of each other where the data sets in the two groups don’t refer to the same values. They may include a group of 100 randomly unrelated patients split into two groups of 50 patients each. One of the groups becomes the control group and is administered a placebo, while the other group receives a prescribed treatment. This constitutes two independent sample groups that are unpaired and unrelated to each other.




What Does a T-Test Explain and How Are They Used?
A t-test is a statistical test that is used to compare the means of two groups. It is often used in hypothesis testing to determine whether a process or treatment has an effect on the population of interest, or whether two groups are different from one another.
What Is Tactical Asset Allocation (TAA)?  

Tactical asset allocation is an active management portfolio strategy that shifts the percentage of assets held in various categories to take advantage of market pricing anomalies or strong market sectors. This strategy allows portfolio managers to create extra value by taking advantage of certain situations in the marketplace. It is a moderately active strategy since managers return to the portfolio's original asset mix once reaching the desired short-term profits.


   Tactical Asset Allocation (TAA) Basics  

To understand tactical asset allocation, one must first understand strategic asset allocation. A portfolio manager may create an investor policy statement (IPS) to set the strategic mix of assets for inclusion in the client's holdings. The manager will look at many factors such as the required rate of return, acceptable risk levels, legal and liquidity requirements, taxes, time horizon, and unique investor circumstances.



The percentage of weighting that each asset class has over the long term is known as the strategic asset allocation. This allocation is the mix of assets and weights that help an investor reach their specific goals. The following is a simple example of typical portfolio allocation and the weight of each asset class.



Cash = 10%Bonds = 35%Stocks = 45%Commodities = 10%


   The Usefulness of Tactical Asset Allocation  

Tactical asset allocation is the process of taking an active stance on the strategic asset allocation itself and adjusting long-term target weights for a short period to capitalize on the market or economic opportunities. For example, assume that data suggests that there will be a substantial increase in demand for commodities over the next 18 months. It may be prudent for an investor to shift more capital into that asset class to take advantage of the opportunity. While the portfolio's strategic allocation will remain the same, the tactical allocation may then become:



Cash = 5%Bonds = 35%Stocks = 45%Commodities = 15%



Tactical shifts may also come within an asset class. Assume the 45% strategic allocation of stocks consists of 30% large-cap and 15% small-cap holdings. If the outlook for small-cap stocks does not look favorable, it may be a wise tactical decision to shift the allocation within stocks to 40% large-cap and 5% small-cap for a short time until conditions change.



Usually, tactical shifts range from 5% to 10%, though they may be lower. In practice, it is unusual to adjust any asset class by more than 10% tactically. This large adjustment would show a fundamental problem with the construction of the strategic asset allocation.



Tactical asset allocation is different from rebalancing a portfolio. During rebalancing, trades are made to bring the portfolio back to its desired strategic asset allocation. Tactical asset allocation adjusts the strategic asset allocation for a short time, with the intention of reverting to the strategic allocation once the short-term opportunities disappear.





Key Takeaways

Tactical asset allocation involves taking an active stance on the strategic asset allocation itself and adjusting long-term target weights for a short period to capitalize on the market or economic opportunities.Tactical shifts may also come within an asset class.In a discretionary TAA, an investor adjusts asset allocation, according to market valuations of the changes in the same market as the investment. 


   Types of Tactical Asset Allocation  

TAA strategies may be either discretionary or systematic. In a discretionary TAA, an investor adjusts asset allocation, according to market valuations of the changes in the same market as the investment. An investor, with substantial stock holdings, for instance, may want to reduce these holdings if bonds are expected to outperform stocks for a period. Unlike stock picking, tactical asset allocation involves judgments on entire markets or sectors. Consequently, some investors perceive TAA as supplemental to mutual fund investing.



Conversely, a systematic tactical asset allocation strategy uses a quantitative investment model to take advantage of inefficiencies or temporary imbalances among different asset classes. These shifts use a basis of known financial market anomalies, or inefficiencies, backed by academic and practitioner research.


   Real World Example  

Forty-six percent of respondents in a survey of smaller hedge funds, endowments, and foundations were found to use tactical asset allocation techniques to beat the market by riding market trends.
What Is the Taft-Hartley Act?  

The Taft-Hartley Act is a 1947 U.S. federal law that extended and modified the 1935 Wagner Act. It prohibits certain union practices and requires disclosure of certain financial and political activities by unions. The bill was initially vetoed by President Truman, but Congress overrode the veto.





Key Takeaways

The Taft-Hartley Act was introduced after several major strikes in 1945 and 1946. The Act of 1947 prohibits certain union practices and requires that they disclose their financial and political activities.Though the legislation was vetoed by Harry S. Truman, the vote was overridden by both the House and Senate and became law.This act is also known as the Labor Management Relations Act (LMRA) and is an amendment to the 1935 Wagner Act.The Taft-Hartley Act has had six amendments including more recent updates to right-to-work laws.


   Understanding the Taft-Hartley Act  

The Labor Management Relations Act (LMRA), commonly known as the Taft-Hartley Act, amended the 1935 National Labor Relations Act (NLRA), or Wagner Act. Congress passed the Taft-Hartley Act in 1947, overriding President Harry Truman's veto.



Union critics at the time called it the "slave-labor bill," but the Republican-controlled Congress—encouraged by the business lobby—saw it as necessary to counter union abuses, to end a string of large-scale strikes that broke out after the end of World War II, and to suppress Communist influence in the labor movement.






The Taft-Hartley Act, like the Wagner Act before it, does not cover domestic help or farmworkers.


   The Taft-Hartley Act Key Amendments and Changes  

Taft-Hartley outlined six unfair practices by labor unions and provided remedies, in the form of amendments, for protecting employees from harm resulting from these practices.



Previously the Wagner Act had only addressed unfair labor practices perpetrated by employers. In 1947, President Harry Truman amended parts of the NLRA when he passed the Taft-Hartley Act. This Act created current right-to-work laws, which allow states to prohibit compulsory membership in a union as a condition for employment in the public and private sectors of the country.



One amendment protected employees' rights under Section 7 of the Wagner Act, giving them the right to form unions and engage in collective bargaining with employers. This amendment protected employees from unfair coercion by unions that could result in discrimination against employees.
A second amendment said that an employer cannot refuse to hire prospective employees because they won't join a union. However, an employer has the right to sign an agreement with a union that requires an employee to join the union on or before the employee's 30th day of employment.
A third amendment stipulated that unions have a requirement to bargain in good faith with employers. This amendment balanced the provisions of the Wagner Act, which required good faith bargaining by employers.
A fourth amendment prohibited secondary boycotts by unions. For example, if a union has a dispute with an employer, the union cannot, under the law, coerce or urge another entity to stop doing business with that employer.
A fifth amendment prohibited unions from taking advantage of their members or employers. Unions were prohibited from charging their members excessive initiation fees or membership dues. Also, unions were prohibited from causing employers to pay for work that its members did not perform.
A sixth amendment added a free speech clause for employers. Employers have the right to express their views and opinions about labor issues, and these views do not constitute unfair labor practices, provided the employer is not threatening to withhold benefits or engage in other retribution against employees.



In February 2021, Congress re-introduced the National Right to Work Act, giving employees nationwide a choice to opt out of joining or paying dues to unions. The Act was also introduced in 2019 and 2017 but stalled.



In March 2021, the United States House of Representatives passed the Protecting the Right to Organize Act (PRO Act). The pro-union legislation overrides right-to-work laws and would make it easier to form unions. As of November 2022, the PRO Act of 2021 has not been voted upon in Congress.






The following states have right-to-work laws: Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, Kansas, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, Mississippi, Nebraska, Nevada, North Carolina, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia, West Virginia, Wisconsin, and Wyoming. The most recent state to enact legislation was Wisconsin in 2015.


  Changes to Union Elections  

The Taft-Hartley Act also made changes to union election rules. These changes excluded supervisors from bargaining groups and gave special treatment to certain professional employees.



The Taft-Hartley Act also created four new types of elections. One gave employers the right to vote on union demands. The other three gave employees the right to hold elections on the status of incumbent unions, to determine whether a union has the power to enter into agreements for employees, and to withdraw union representation after it's granted. In 1951, Congress repealed the provisions governing union shop elections.




Why Was Taft-Hartley Act Passed?
The Taft-Hartley Act's purpose was to regulate labor unions and restrict what unions can do during periods of national emergency, The act prohibits unions from engaging in several unfair practices.




What Did the Taft-Hartley Act Make Illegal?
The Taft-Hartley Act made a number of different union practices prohibited. These practices include jurisdictional strikes, wildcat strikes, political strikes, solidarity strikes, and secondary boycotts. It also outlawed discrimination against nonunion members by union hiring halls and closed shops.




Is the Taft-Hartley Act Still In Effect?
The Taft-Hartley Act was vetoed by President Harry S. Truman in 1947. Still, the act was enacted by the 80th U.S. Congress after receiving support from both congressional representatives from both the Democrat and Republican parties. The act continues to be strongly opposed by many, though the act remains in effect.


   The Bottom Line  

Enacted in 1947, the Taft-Hartley Act was intended to protect employee rights by unfair practices by unions. The act prohibits unions from performing certain practices and requires disclosure of certain activities. The act has many detractors who feel the act has hurt labor laws and decrease worker rights.
What Are Tag-Along Rights?  

Tag-along rights also referred to as "co-sale rights," are contractual obligations used to protect a minority shareholder, usually in a venture capital deal. If a majority shareholder sells his stake, it gives the minority shareholder the right to join the transaction and sell their minority stake in the company. Tag-alongs effectively oblige the majority shareholder to include the holdings of the minority holder in the negotiations so that the tag-along right is exercised.





Key Takeaways

Tag-along rights are contractual obligations to protect a minority investor in a startup or company.Tag-along rights are mainly used to ensure that the stake of minority stakeholders is considered during a company sale.Tag-along rights also provide greater liquidity to minority shareholders.The minority investors are entitled to the same price and conditions as the majority investor when the shares are sold.Tag-along rights can sometimes make it more difficult for a sale to be completed.


   Understanding Tag-Along Rights  

Tag-along rights are pre-negotiated rights that a minority shareholder includes in their initial issuance of a company's stock. These rights allow a minority shareholder to sell their share if a majority shareholder is negotiating a sale for their stake. Tag-along rights are prevalent in startup companies and other private firms with considerable upside potential.



Tag-along rights give minority shareholders the ability to capitalize on a deal that a larger shareholder — often a financial institution with considerable pull — puts together. Large shareholders, such as venture capital firms, often have a greater ability to source buyers and negotiate payment terms. Tag-along rights, therefore, provide minority shareholders with greater liquidity. Private equity shares are incredibly hard to sell, but majority shareholders can often facilitate purchases and sales on the secondary market.






Under most states' laws regarding corporations, majority shareholders owe a fiduciary duty to minority shareholders, meaning they must deal with minority shareholders honestly and in good faith.


   Advantages and Disadvantages of Tag-Along Rights  

One of the most basic advantages of using tag-along rights is that it gives the business' minority shareholders (including, sometimes, employees given stock ownership) financial and legal protection when the company is being sold. When a sale is proposed, minority shareholders typically don't possess enough bargaining power and legal knowledge to properly negotiate for a better deal. Tag-along rights benefit minority shareholders because they're able to receive the same benefits the majority shareholders bargain for.



The flip side of this coin is that tag-along rights may discourage majority shareholders from investing in the company. After all, tag-along rights force the company's management and large shareholders to make concessions that will only benefit the minority shareholders. In other words, some investors will simply not select a company that makes less-than-favorable obligations of them.


   Example of Tag-Along Rights  

Co-founders, angel investors, and venture capital firms often rely on tag-along rights. For example, let's assume that three co-founders launch a tech company. The business is going well, and the co-founders believe that they have proved the concept enough to scale. The co-founders then seek outside investment in the form of a seed round. A private equity angel investor sees the value of the company and offers to purchase 60% of it, requiring a large amount of equity to compensate for the risk of investing in the small company. The co-founders accept the investment, making the angel investor the largest shareholder.



The investor is tech-focused and has significant relationships with some of the larger, public technology companies. The startup co-founders know this and, therefore, negotiate tag-along rights in their investment agreement. The business grows consistently over the next three years, and the angel investor, happy with their investment return on paper, looks for a buyer of their equity among the major tech companies.



The investor finds a buyer who wants to purchase the entire 60% stake for $30 a share. The tag-along rights negotiated by the three co-founders give them the ability to include their equity shares in the sale. The minority investors are entitled to the same price and terms as the majority investor. Thus, the three co-founders, using their rights, effectively sell their shares for $30 each.


   Tag-Along Rights FAQs  
  What Is the Difference Between Tag-Along Rights and Drag-Along Rights?  

Tag-along or co-sale rights are essentially the opposite of drag-along rights. Whereas tag-along rights give minority shareholders negotiating rights in the event of a sale, drag-along rights force the minority shareholders to accept whatever deal is negotiated by majority shareholders.


  Do Tag-Along Rights Make it Easier or Harder to Sell Shares in a Company?  

In some instances, tag-along rights can make the selling process more difficult. It becomes harder to complete the sale when the potential buyer doesn't want to increase or change the terms of their offer in order to please minority shareholders.


  What Is a Come-Along Clause?  

A come-along clause, also referred to as drag-along rights, force minority shareholders to sell their shares when majority shareholders decide to sell theirs. A come-along clause is essentially the opposite of tag-along rights.
What Is the Taguchi Method of Quality Control?  

The Taguchi method of quality control is an approach to engineering that emphasizes the roles of research and development (R&D), and product design and development in reducing the occurrence of defects and failures in manufactured goods.



This method, developed by Japanese engineer and statistician Genichi Taguchi, considers design to be more important than the manufacturing process in quality control and aims to eliminate variances in production before they can occur.





Key Takeaways

In engineering, the Taguchi method of quality control focuses on design and development to create efficient, reliable products.Its founder, Genichi Taguchi, considers design to be more important than the manufacturing process in quality control and seeks to eliminate variances in production before they can occur.Companies such as Toyota, Ford, Boeing, and Xerox have adopted this method.


   Understanding the Taguchi Method of Quality Control  

The Taguchi method gauges quality as a calculation of loss to society associated with a product. In particular, loss in a product is defined by variations and deviations in its function as well as detrimental side effects that result from the product.



Loss from variation in function is a comparison of how much each unit of the product differs in the way it operates. The greater that variance, the more significant the loss in function and quality. This could be represented as a monetary figure denoting how usage has been impacted by defects in the product.


   Example of the Taguchi Method of Quality Control  

If the product is a precision drill that must consistently drill holes of an exact size in all materials it is used on, then part of its quality is determined by how much the units of the product differ from those standards. With the Taguchi method of quality control, the focus is to use research and design to ensure that every unit of the product will closely match those design specifications and perform exactly as designed.



Loss from detrimental side effects on society speaks to whether or not the design of the product could inherently lead to an adverse impact. For example, if operating the precision drill could cause injury to the operator because of how it is designed, there is a loss of quality in the product. Under the Taguchi method, work done during the design stage of creation would aim to minimize the possibility that the drill is crafted in a way that could cause injuries to the operator.



From a higher perspective, the Taguchi method would also strive to reduce the cost to society to use the product, such as by designing goods to be more efficient in their operation rather than generate waste. For instance, the drill could be designed to minimize the need for regular maintenance. 


   History of the Taguchi Method of Quality Control  

Genichi Taguchi, a Japanese engineer and statistician, began formulating the Taguchi method while developing a telephone-switching system for Electrical Communication Laboratory, a Japanese company, in the 1950s. Using statistics, he aimed to improve the quality of manufactured goods.



By the 1980s, Taguchi's ideas began gaining prominence in the Western world, leading him to become well-known in the United States, having already enjoyed success in his native Japan. Big-name global companies such as Toyota Motor Corp., Ford Motor Co., Boeing Co., and Xerox Holdings Corp. have adopted his methods.


   Criticism of the Taguchi Method of Quality Control  

Taguchi’s methods have not always been well received by Western statisticians. One of the biggest accusations against his quality control methodology is that it is unnecessarily complicated. In fact, some skeptics even claim that a doctorate in mathematics is required to understand it.
What Is Tail Risk?  

Tail risk is a form of portfolio risk that arises when the possibility that an investment will move more than three standard deviations from the mean is greater than what is shown by a normal distribution.



Tail risks include events that have a small probability of occurring and occur at both ends of a normal distribution curve.





Key Takeaways

Tail risk is the chance of a loss occurring due to a rare event, as predicted by a probability distribution.Colloquially, a short-term move of more than three standard deviations is considered to instantiate tail risk.While tail risk technically refers to both the left and right tails, people are most concerned with losses (the left tail).Tail events have had experts questions the true probability distribution of returns for investable assets.


   Understanding Tail Risk  

Traditional portfolio strategies typically follow the idea that market returns follow a normal distribution. However, the concept of tail risk suggests that the distribution of returns is not normal, but skewed, and has fatter tails.



The fat tails indicate that there is a probability, which may be larger than otherwise anticipated, that an investment will move beyond three standard deviations. Distributions that are characterized by fat tails are often seen when looking at hedge fund returns, for example.



The chart below depicts three curves of increasing right-skewness, with fat tails to the downside—and which differ from the symmetrical bell curve shape of the normal distribution.















Right skewness.


   Normal Distributions and Asset Returns  

When a portfolio of investments is put together, it is assumed that the distribution of returns will follow a normal distribution. Under this assumption, the probability that returns will move between the mean and three standard deviations, either positive or negative, is approximately 99.7%. This means that the probability of returns moving more than three standard deviations beyond the mean is 0.3%.



The assumption that market returns follow a normal distribution is key to many financial models, such as Harry Markowitz's modern portfolio theory (MPT) and the Black-Scholes-Merton option pricing model. However, this assumption does not properly reflect market returns, and tail events have a large effect on market returns.






Tail risk is highlighted in Nassim Taleb's bestselling financial book The Black Swan.


   Other Distributions and Their Tails  

Stock market returns tend to follow a normal distribution that has excess kurtosis. Kurtosis is a statistical measure that indicates whether observed data follow a heavy- or light-tailed distribution in relation to the normal distribution. The normal distribution curve has a kurtosis equal to three and, therefore, if a security follows a distribution with kurtosis greater than three, it is said to have fat tails.



A leptokurtic distribution, or heavy/fat-tailed distribution, depicts situations in which extreme outcomes have occurred more than expected. Compared to the normal distribution, these curves have excess kurtosis. Therefore, securities that follow this distribution have experienced returns that have exceeded three standard deviations beyond the mean more than 0.3% of the observed outcomes.



The graph below depicts the normal distribution (in green) as well as increasingly leptokurtic curves (in red and blue), which exhibit fat tails.

   Hedging Against Tail Risk  

Although tail events that negatively impact portfolios are rare, they may have large negative returns. Therefore, investors should hedge against these events. Hedging against tail risk aims to enhance returns over the long term, but investors must assume short-term costs. Investors may look to diversify their portfolios to hedge against tail risk.



For example, if an investor is long exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that track the Standard & Poor's 500 Index (S&P 500), the investor could hedge against tail risk by purchasing derivatives on the Cboe Volatility Index, which is inversely correlated to the S&P 500.
What Is Takaful?  

Takaful is a type of Islamic insurance wherein members contribute money into a pool system to guarantee each other against loss or damage. Takaful-branded insurance is based on sharia or Islamic religious law, which explains how individuals are responsible to cooperate and protect one another. Takaful policies cover health, life, and general insurance needs.



Takaful insurance companies were introduced as an alternative to those in the commercial insurance industry, which are believed to go against Islamic restrictions on riba (interest), al-maisir (gambling), and al-gharar (uncertainty) principles—all of which are outlawed in sharia.





Key Takeaways

Takaful is a type of Islamic insurance wherein members contribute money into a pool system to guarantee each other.Takaful-branded insurance is based on sharia or Islamic religious law and covers health, life, and general insurance needs. Any claims made by participants are paid out of the takaful fund.


   Understanding Takaful  

All parties or policyholders in a takaful arrangement agree to guarantee each other and make contributions to a pool or mutual fund instead of paying premiums. The pool of collected contributions creates the takaful fund. Each participant's contribution is based on the type of coverage they require and their personal circumstances. A takaful contract specifies the nature of the risk and the length of the coverage, similar to that of a conventional insurance policy.



The takaful fund is managed and administered on behalf of the participants by a takaful operator, who charges an agreed-upon fee to cover costs. Much like a conventional insurance company, costs include sales and marketing, underwriting, and claims management.



Any claims made by participants are paid out of the takaful fund and any remaining surpluses, after making provisions for the likely cost of future claims and other reserves, belong to the participants in the fund—not the takaful operator. Those funds may be distributed to the participants as cash dividends or distributions, or via a reduction in future contributions. 



An Islamic insurance company operating a takaful fund must operate under the following principles:



It must operate according to Islamic cooperative principles.A reinsurance commission may only be received from or paid out to Islamic insurance and reinsurance companies.The insurance company must maintain two separate funds: a participant and policyholder fund, and a shareholder fund.


   Special Considerations  

According to Allied Market Research, the global takaful insurance market was valued at $24.85 billion in 2020 and is projected to reach $97.17 billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 14.6% from 2021 to 2030. 






Since 60% of the global Muslim population is comprised of young Muslims—less than 25 years of age—this demographic can represent a sizeable customer base as their wealth grows over time.



Some of the largest names in the takaful market, according to a Research and Markets report, were believed to be the following:

   Takaful vs. Conventional Insurance   

Most Islamic jurists conclude that conventional insurance is unacceptable in Islam because it does not conform with sharia for the following reasons:



Conventional insurance includes an element of al-gharar or uncertainty.Conventional insurance is based on the concept and practice of charging interest. Islamic insurance, on the other hand, is based on tabarru, where a portion of the contributions made by participants is treated as a donation. This is why policyholders in takaful are usually referred to as participants.Conventional insurance is considered a form of gambling.
Take-home pay is the net amount of income received after the deduction of taxes, benefits, and voluntary contributions from a paycheck. It is the difference resulting from the subtraction of all deductions from gross income. Deductions include federal, state and local income tax, Social Security and Medicare contributions, retirement account contributions, and medical, dental and other insurance premiums. The net amount or take-home pay is what the employee receives. 


   The Basics of Take-Home Pay  

The net pay amount listed on a paycheck is the take-home pay. Paychecks or pay statements report the income attributable to a given pay period. Pay statements list both earnings and deductions. Common deductions are income tax, Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA) and Medicare tax withholdings. There may also be less common deductions such as court-ordered child support or alimony, and uniform upkeep cost. The net pay is the amount remaining after all deductions are taken. Many paychecks also have cumulative fields that show the year-to-date earnings, withholdings, and deduction amounts.  



Gross pay is often shown as a line item on a pay statement. If it is not shown, you may calculate it either by dividing the annual salary by the number of pay periods, or by multiplying the hourly wage by the number of hours worked in a pay period.



For example, an employee earning an annual salary of $50,000 which is paid every two weeks will have gross pay of $1,923.08 ($50,000/26 pay periods) per paycheck.  


   Significance of Take-Home Pay vs. Gross Pay  

Take-home pay can differ significantly from gross pay. As an example, an employee paid an hourly wage of $15/hour who works 80 hours per pay period has a gross pay of $1,200 (15 x 80 =1200). But, if after deductions the employee's take-home pay is $900, the employee is earning $11.25/hour as a take-home rate ($900/80=$11.25).



As seen, this employee's take-home pay rate differs significantly from the gross pay rate. Many credit rating and lending agencies will consider take-home pay when lending money for large purchases, such as vehicles, and property.
What Is Take or Pay?  

Take or pay is a provision in a contract stating that a buyer has the obligation of either taking delivery of goods from a seller or paying a specified penalty amount to the seller for not taking them. Take-or-pay provisions benefit both parties by sharing risk, and they benefit society by facilitating trade and reducing transactions costs.





Key Takeaways

Take or pay is a type of provision in a purchase contract that guarantees the seller a minimum portion of the agreed-on payment if the buyer does not follow through with actually buying the full amount of goods.Take-or-pay provisions can commonly be found in the energy sector, where overhead costs are high.Take-or-pay provisions benefit buyers, sellers, and the economy as a whole by sharing the risk of overhead investment and facilitating commerce that might otherwise not occur. 


   Understanding Take or Pay  

A take-or-pay provision is generally included between a company and its supplier. It requires the purchasing firm to take a stipulated amount of goods from the supplier by a certain date, at the risk of paying a fine to the supplier if it doesn’t.



This sort of agreement benefits the supplier by reducing the risk of losing money on any capital spent to produce whatever product it is trying to sell. It benefits the buyer by allowing it to ask for a lower negotiated price elsewhere. The provision can be an overall net gain to the economy, because the sharing of risk by the buyer and supplier facilitates both a transaction that might otherwise not occur and the accompanying gains from trade for both parties. 



Take-or-pay provisions are very common in the energy sector. This is because of the substantial overhead costs for suppliers to provide energy units, such as natural gas or crude oil, and the volatility of energy prices. The overhead costs of providing crude oil as compared with giving a haircut, for example, are very high. Take-or-pay contracts provide energy suppliers an incentive to invest capital up front, because they have a measure of assurance that they’ll be able to sell their products. Without a take-or-pay provision, the supplier bears all the risk that the buyer’s ongoing need for the energy might dry up or that a price swing might induce the buyer to break the contract.



The supplier could also be subject to what is termed a “holdup” by the buyer if it has made overhead investments that will lose value if the buyer does not buy the output as agreed. Holdups are a type of transaction cost, identified by economist Oliver Williamson, that occurs with these kind of relationship-specific assets.


   Examples of Take or Pay  

Firm A contracts to purchase 200 million cubic feet of natural gas from Firm B over 10 years at an agreed amount of 20 million per year. Firm A finds, however, that this year it will only need 18 million. Firm A does not purchase the full 20 million and is instead subjected to a fee that was agreed to in the original contract. The fee is defined in the contract and is usually less than the full purchase price. In this case a reasonable fee might be 50% of the contract price of those two million cubic feet. 



Alternatively, with world gas prices having fallen significantly during the course of the contract, Firm A decides to decline the delivery entirely and instead purchase gas from another supplier, Firm C, at a new, lower price. Instead, it pays the agreed penalty to Firm B. It is in Firm A’s interest to do this if the total cost of the gas from Firm C plus 50% of the original negotiated price with Firm B is still less than the originally negotiated price to take Firm B’s gas.



In both cases each party benefits from the take-or-pay provision. Firm A gets only the amount of gas it needs at a lower total cost than it would have paid Firm B, while Firm B at least receives the penalty price from Firm A, rather than, in the first instance, losing the full cost of two million cubic feet of gas or, in the latter case, getting nothing at all when Firm A switched suppliers.




What Is Take or Pay?
A take-or-pay clause in a contract stipulates that a buyer will take an agreed-upon amount of a commodity from a seller on a certain date or pay a set penalty fee if it does not. The fee is generally less than the full purchase price of the commodity.




Who Benefits From Take or Pay?
Everyone benefits. The supplier has its risk in spending capital to produce its commodity reduced because it knows it will get at least a certain amount of money for it. The buyer benefits because it is free to search for a lower price for the commodity elsewhere. The economy benefits because the provision facilitates trade and reduces transaction costs.




What Is a Holdup?
A holdup occurs when a buyer has information on the capital costs of its supplier for making the commodity being purchased. The supplier’s investment may in part be based on its relationship with the buyer, customizing it particularly for the buyer. In effect, the buyer shares in the supplier’s gross return on the investment. The supplier may be said to be held up if the buyer makes the decision not to purchase the commodity because it does not like the price after the investment is already made.


   The Bottom Line  

Take or pay allows buyers and sellers to share risk in a transaction. If the buyer does not buy the goods—or does not buy all the goods the contract stipulated—the seller receives a penalty fee. This also allows the buyer additional flexibility if economic conditions change between the time of the agreement and the date when the purchase is due to be made.
What Is a Take-Out Loan?  

A take-out loan is a type of long-term financing that replaces short-term interim financing. Such loans are usually mortgages that are collateralized with assets and have fixed payments that are amortizing.



Take-out lenders who underwrite these loans are normally large financial conglomerates, such as insurance or investment companies, while banks or savings and loan companies usually issue short-term loans, such as a construction loan.





Key Takeaways

A take-out loan provides a long-term mortgage or loan on a property that "takes out" an existing loan.The take-out loan will replace interim financing, such as replacing a construction loan with a fixed-term mortgage.If the take-out loan is used to finance a rental or income-generating property, the take-out lender may be entitled to a portion of the rents earned.


   Understanding Take-Out Loans  

A borrower must complete a full credit application to obtain approval for a take-out loan, which is used to replace a previous loan, often one with a shorter duration and higher interest rate. All types of borrowers can get a take-out loan from a credit issuer to pay off past debts. Take-out loans can be used as a long-term personal loan to pay off previous outstanding balances with other creditors. They are most commonly used in real estate construction to help a borrower replace a short-term construction loan and obtain more-favorable financing terms. The take-out loan's terms can include monthly payments or a one-time balloon payment at maturity.






Take-out loans are an important way of stabilizing your financing by replacing a short-term, higher-interest-rate loan with a long-term, lower-interest-rate one.


   How Do Businesses Use Take-Out Loans?  

Construction projects on all types of real estate property require a high initial investment, yet they are not backed by a fully completed piece of property. Therefore, construction companies typically must obtain high-interest short-term loans to complete the initial phases of property development. Construction companies may choose to obtain a delayed draw term loan, which can be based on various construction milestones being met before principal balances are dispersed. They also have the option of obtaining a short-term loan.



Many short-term loans will provide the borrower with a principal payout that requires payment at a future time. Often the borrowing terms allow the borrower to make a one-time payoff at the loan’s maturity. This provides an optimal opportunity for a borrower to obtain a take-out loan with more-favorable terms.


   Example of a Take-Out Loan  

Assume XYZ company has received approval for plans to build a commercial real estate office building over 12 to 18 months. It may obtain a short-term loan for the financing it needs to build the property, with full repayment required in 18 months. The property plans are achieved ahead of schedule and the building is completed in 12 months. XYZ now has more negotiating power, because the fully complete property is able to be used as collateral. Thus, it decides to obtain a take-out loan, which provides it with the principal to pay off the previous loan six months early.



The new loan allows XYZ to make monthly payments over 15 years at an interest rate that is half of that of the short-term loan. With the take-out loan, it can repay its short-term loan six months early, saving on interest costs. XYZ now has 15 years to pay its new take-out loan at a much lower rate of interest, using the completed property as collateral.
What is a Take-Profit Order (T/P)  

A take-profit order (T/P) is a type of limit order that specifies the exact price at which to close out an open position for a profit. If the price of the security does not reach the limit price, the take-profit order does not get filled.





Key Takeaways

Take-profit (T/P) orders are limit orders that are closed when a specified profit level is reached.Limit prices for T/P orders are placed using either fundamental or technical analysis.Take-profit orders are beneficial for short-term traders interested in profiting from a quick bump in the security costs.


   Basics of a Take-Profit Order  

Most traders use take-profit orders in conjunction with stop-loss orders (S/L) to manage their open positions. If the security rises to the take-profit point, the T/P order is executed and the position is closed for a gain. If the security falls to the stop-loss point, the S/L order is executed and the position is closed for a loss. The difference between the market price and these two points helps define the trade's risk-to-reward ratio.



The benefit of using a take-profit order is that the trader doesn't have to worry about manually executing a trade or second-guessing themselves. On the other hand, take-profit orders are executed at the best possible price regardless of the underlying security's behavior. The stock could start to breakout higher, but the T/P order might execute at the very beginning of the breakout, resulting in high opportunity costs.



Take-profit orders are best used by short-term traders interested in managing their risk. This is because they can get out of a trade as soon as their planned profit target is reached and not risk a possible future downturn in the market. Traders with a long-term strategy do not favor such orders because it cuts into their profits.



Take-profit orders are often placed at levels that are defined by other forms of technical analysis, including chart pattern analysis and support and resistance levels, or using money management techniques, such as the Kelly Criterion. Many trading system developers also use take-profit orders when placing automated trades since they can be well-defined and serve as a great risk management technique.


   Take-Profit Order Example  

Suppose that a trader spots an ascending triangle chart pattern and opens a new long position. If the stock has a breakout, the trader expects that it will rise to 15 percent from its current levels. If the stock doesn't breakout, the trader wants to quickly exit the position and move on to the next opportunity. The trader might create a take-profit order that is 15 percent higher than the market price in order to automatically sell when the stock reaches that level. At the same time, they may place a stop-loss order that's five percent below the current market price.



The combination of the take-profit and stop-loss order creates a 5:15 risk-to-reward ratio, which is favorable assuming that the odds of reaching each outcome are equal, or if the odds are skewed toward the breakout scenario. 



By placing the take-profit order, the trader doesn't have to worry about diligently tracking the stock throughout the day or second-guessing themselves with regards to how high the stock may go after the breakout. There is a well-defined risk-to-reward ratio and the trader knows what to expect before the trade even occurs.
What Is a Takeover?  

A takeover occurs when one company makes a successful bid to assume control of or acquire another. Takeovers can be done by purchasing a majority stake in the target firm. Takeovers are also commonly done through the merger and acquisition process. In a takeover, the company making the bid is the acquirer and the company it wishes to take control of is called the target.



Takeovers are typically initiated by a larger company seeking to take over a smaller one. They can be voluntary, meaning they are the result of a mutual decision between the two companies. In other cases, they may be unwelcome, in which case the acquirer goes after the target without its knowledge or some times without its full agreement.



In corporate finance, there can be a variety of ways for structuring a takeover. An acquirer may choose to take over controlling interest of the company’s outstanding shares, buy the entire company outright, merge an acquired company to create new synergies, or acquire the company as a subsidiary.





Key Takeaways

A takeover occurs when an acquiring company successfully closes on a bid to assume control of or acquire a target company.Takeovers are typically initiated by a larger company seeking to take over a smaller one.Takeovers can be welcome and friendly, or they may be unwelcome and hostile.Companies may initiate takeovers because they find value in a target company, they want to initiate change, or they may want to eliminate the competition.


   Understanding Takeovers  

Takeovers are fairly common in the business world. However, they may be structured in a multitude of ways. Whether both parties are in agreement or not, will often influence the structuring of a takeover. 



Keep in mind, if a company owns more than 50% of the shares of a company, it is considered controlling interest. Controlling interest requires a company to account for the owned company as a subsidiary in its financial reporting, and this requires consolidated financial statements.﻿﻿ A 20% to 50% ownership stake is accounted for more simply through the equity method.﻿﻿ If a full-on merger or acquisition occurs, shares will often be combined under one symbol. 


   Types of Takeovers  

Takeovers can take many different forms. A welcome or friendly takeover will usually be structured as a merger or acquisition. These generally go smoothly because the boards of directors for both companies usually consider it a positive situation. Voting must still take place in a friendly takeover. However, when the board of directors and key shareholders are in favor of the takeover, takeover voting can more easily be achieved. 



Usually, in these cases of mergers or acquisitions, shares will be combined under one symbol. This can be done by exchanging shares from the target’s shareholders to shares of the combined entity.



An unwelcome or hostile takeover can be quite aggressive as one party is not a willing participant. The acquiring firm can use unfavorable tactics such as a dawn raid, where it buys a substantial stake in the target company as soon as the markets open, causing the target to lose control before it realizes what is happening.



The target firm’s management and board of directors may strongly resist takeover attempts by implementing tactics such as a poison pill, which allows the target’s shareholders to purchase more shares at a discount to dilute the potential acquirer’s holdings and voting rights.



A reverse takeover happens when a private company takes over a public one. The acquiring company must have enough capital to fund the takeover. Reverse takeovers provide a way for a private company to go public without having to take on the risk or added expense of going through an initial public offering (IPO).



A creeping takeover occurs when one company slowly increases its share ownership in another. Once the share ownership gets to 50% or more, the acquiring company is required to account for the target’s business through consolidated financial statement reporting.﻿﻿ The 50% level can thus be a significant threshold, particularly since some companies may not want the responsibilities of controlling ownership. After the 50% threshold has been breached, the target company should be considered a subsidiary.



Creeping takeovers may also involve activists who increasingly buy shares of a company with the intent of creating value through management changes. An activist takeover would likely happen gradually over time.

   Reasons for a Takeover  

There are many reasons why companies may initiate a takeover. An acquiring company may pursue an opportunistic takeover, where it believes the target is well priced. By buying the target, the acquirer may feel there is long-term value. With these takeovers, the acquiring company usually increases its market share, achieves economies of scale, reduces costs, and increases profits through synergies.



Some companies may opt for a strategic takeover. This allows the acquirer to enter a new market without taking on any extra time, money, or risk. The acquirer may also be able to eliminate competition by going through a strategic takeover.



There can also be activist takeovers. With these takeovers, a shareholder seeks controlling interest ownership to initiate change or acquire controlling voting rights.



Companies that make attractive takeover targets include:



Those with a unique niche in a particular product or service
Small companies with viable products or services but insufficient financing
Similar companies in close geographic proximity where combining forces could improve efficiency
Otherwise viable companies that pay too much for debt that could be refinanced at a lower cost if a larger company with better credit took over
Companies with good potential value but management challenges


   Funding Takeovers  

Financing takeovers can come in many different forms. When the target is a publicly-traded company, the acquiring company can buy shares of the business in the secondary market. In a friendly merger or acquisition, the acquirer makes an offer for all of the target’s outstanding shares. A friendly merger or acquisition will usually be funded through cash, debt, or new stock issuance of the combined entity. 



When a company uses debt, it's known as a leveraged buyout. Debt capital for the acquirer may come from new funding lines or the issuance of new corporate bonds.


   Example of a Takeover  

ConAgra initially attempted a friendly acquisition of Ralcorp in 2011. When initial advances were rebuffed, ConAgra intended to work a hostile takeover. Ralcorp responded by using the poison pill strategy. ConAgra responded by offering $94 per share, which was significantly higher than the $65 per share Ralcorp was trading at when the takeover attempt began. Ralcorp denied the attempt, though both companies returned to the bargaining table the following year.﻿﻿



The deal was ultimately made as part of a friendly takeover with a per-share price of $90.﻿﻿ By this time, Ralcorp had completed the spinoff of its Post cereal division, resulting in approximately the same offering price by ConAgra for a slightly smaller total business.﻿﻿
What Is a Tangible Asset?  

A tangible asset is an asset that has a finite monetary value and usually a physical form. Tangible assets can typically always be transacted for some monetary value though the liquidity of different markets will vary. Tangible assets are the opposite of intangible assets which have a theorized value rather than a transactional exchange value.





Key Takeaways

Tangible assets are items with a real physical form that may depreciate in value over time.Tangible assets are recorded on the balance sheet, usually as a long-term asset.Tangible assets are usually less liquid than intangible assets, items that you can't touch.Though tangible assets usually have real world value, they are also associated with potentially higher expenses or risks such as storage, insurance, and obsolescence.Examples of tangible assets include land, buildings, machinery, or inventory.












Investopedia / Candra Huff


   Understanding Tangible Assets  

A business’s net worth and core operations are highly dependent on its assets. Management of assets and asset implications is one key reason why companies maintain a balance sheet. Assets are recorded on the balance sheet and must balance in the simple equations assets minus liabilities equals shareholders’ equity which governs the balance sheet.



Companies have two types of assets: tangible and intangible. Tangible assets are assets with a finite or discrete value and usually a physical form. These are items a company uses in its operations that it can touch and utilize in the real world. There are several common characteristics that most tangible assets have:



Tangible assets have a physical form that can be touched, altered, or seen.Tangible assets are used to drive future economic benefits for a company.Tangible assets may depreciate over time as their physical form begins to deteriorate.Tangible assets can often be used as collateral for securing loans and debt.Tangible assets may hold residual value after their useful life has been fully depleted.


   Types of Tangible Assets  

Tangible assets can be either current assets or long-term assets. Current assets may or may not have a physical onsite presence but they will have a finite transaction value.



Long-term assets, sometimes called fixed assets, comprise the second portion of the asset section on the balance sheet. These long-term assets have less liquidity and are often more capital-intensive in nature. Long-term assets are usually tangible assets much larger in size.



Tangible assets are recorded on the balance sheet at the cost incurred to acquire them. Long-term tangible assets are reduced in value over time through depreciation. Depreciation is a noncash balance sheet notation that reduces the value of assets by a scheduled amount over time. Current assets are converted to cash within one year and therefore do not need to be devalued over time. For example, inventory is a current asset that is usually sold within one year.


  Inventory  

If you can physically touch a product, it is tangible. Therefore, many types of inventory are tangible assets. Be mindful that very similar products may have different characteristics. For example, a CD from your favorite artist could be physical inventory, though digital mp3 files of the same songs are intangible.



Tangible inventory assets cover the entire spectrum of manufacturing. This begins with sourced raw materials and continues to goods in process that the company has begun manufacturing. Last, tangible assets also includes finish products that the company has not yet sold that are being reported as inventory.


  Equipment/Machinery  

When considering a manufacturing company, all of the pieces of heavy equipment used to process inventory items are tangible assets. This includes any part of the production line that works physically interact with during the preparation, manufacturing, assembly, or quality control.  


  Furnishing and Fixtures  

When looking around an office, essentially everything in view is a tangible asset. Whether its desks, cubicles, computer set-ups, office furniture for visitors, components of meeting rooms, supplies, or other furnishings, almost every aspect of a workplace can be touched and interacted with.


  Land  

Regardless of how it is intended to be used, land is a tangible asset. This is true whether the land is being held for speculative growth, future redevelopment, or the long-term plans are not yet known. This is also true of all types of land; whether rural or city, physical land is a tangible asset. This is counter to digital plots of ownership emerging in metaverse platforms. Because the section of real estate can not be touched, digital land is not a tangible asset.


  Buildings  

Physical structures are often the largest and most obvious type of tangible asset. This may include offices, warehouses, manufacturing plants or other types of commercial real estate. Whether or not a company has shifted to remote work, any existing office (even not being utilized) is a tangible asset. Improvements to that building are often tangible assets as well.






"Tangible assets" is not a category reported on financial statements. Instead, these assets are spread across current and long-term assets.


   How to Value Tangible Assets  

There's three primary ways a tangible asset can be valued. the uniqueness, location, and condition of the tangible asset will drive the ideal valuation method mentioned below.


  Specific Appraisal  

When the most precise tangible asset value is needed, a company often hires an external, independent appraiser. The appraiser is often an expert in a given field (i.e. an expert in a specific type of collectible or an expert in real estate). The appraiser evaluates the condition of the tangible asset as well as incorporating external factors impacting the value.



At the end of an appraisal, the appraiser often issues an appraisal report. That report outlines the conditions of the asset; for properties, specific sections will often exist for the interior and exterior conditions. The report will note modernization efforts, construction quality, market conditions, and any notable impairments to recognize for the asset.


  Liquidation Price  

One could argue that the value of a tangible is the money it is able to fetch for it in the open market. With this reasoning, the value of a tangible asset is the liquidation price it would receive should it brought to market. Regardless of an external appraisal or insurance report, a company may treat a tangible asset only worth whatever they can immediately sell it for.



Liquidation price will often be less than an appraiser's value for several reasons. First, there are usually significant costs that a company may incorporate into the liquidation price. Second, some tangible assets are illiquid and may be difficult to move. For this reason, a company may be forced to incentivize buyers with substantial pricing discounts that do not property reflect the true value of the building when sold in a normal, careful sale process.


  Replacement Cost  

The third type of valuation method is primarily used by insurance carriers as part of a policy. Insurers generally use replacement cost as the basis for determining what a building is worth. For this reason, the insurance company will set the policy so in case there is a claim, the claimant may receive proceeds to replace their asset, not necessarily receiving compensation for the actual full value.


   Advantages and Disadvantages of Tangible Assets  

Tangible assets hold "real" value; buildings can be occupied, land can be utilized, and machinery can be used. As opposed to investments or intangible assets, real assets hold a purpose beyond their means as an investment.



For this reason, some argue tangible assets make more sense in specific investment climates. For example, farmland is always in demand as the world continually needs agriculture and food. During uncertain investment periods, some advisors may claim that this type of tangible asset makes sense to invest in due to the stable use of such an asset. In addition, the asset class may move entirely differently than the stock market due to being a completely different type of asset.



By extension, tangible assets usually have dual investment opportunity: valuation appreciation and operating cash flow. Consider a commercial office in a favorable downtown location. Not only is the property value likely increasing, the building owner is receiving rent from tenants. Because tangible property can be used, it can generate operating income on top of increasing in value.






Government agencies often have guidance and limitations to what may be considered tangible assets. It may also choose to segregate tangible assets by category such as California's State Administrative Manual.



Not everything is perfect for tangible assets, though. Consider the risks to farmland such inclement weather or improper tilling techniques that deplete the arability of the land. In addition, consider the risk of obsolescence for the building; during COVID-19, as workers shifted to remote work, such offices were left vacated and not needed by companies.



Smaller tangible assets may be an easier target for theft as well. The theft of digital assets may require technical knowledge, and your actions may still be traceable back to your personal accounts. For tangible assets such as inventory, illegal ownership is a function of physically possession; if a thief can walk out of a store with new headphones, they claim ownership of the tangible asset even if it is not rightfully theirs. Therefore, it may cost more to protect, store, and oversee tangible assets.




Tangible Assets

Pros

May be more stable investment due to consistent underlying use
Often has real world application that increases its value
May generate cashflow if rented out for use
May have low correlation to other asset classes due to difference in underlying asset profile



Cons

May be subject to physical damage (via nature or intentional human destruction)
May become obsolete if more advanced tangible assets are introduced
May be more subject to theft due to potentially easier access
Often requires additional expenses to store, manage, and protect goods





   Tangible vs. Intangible Assets  

Asset values are important for managing shareholders’ equity and the return on equity ratio metric. Tangible and intangible assets are the two types of assets that makeup the full list of assets comprehensively for a firm. As such, both values are recorded on the balance sheet and analyzed in total performance management.



Intangible assets include non-physical assets that usually have a theoretical value generated by a firm’s own valuation. These assets include things like copyrights, trademarks, patents, licenses, and brand equity value. Intangible assets are recorded on a balance sheet as long-term assets.



There are some itemized values associated with intangible assets that can help form the basis of their balance sheet value such as their registration and renewal costs. Generally though, expenses associated with intangible assets will fall under general and much of intangible value must be determined by the firm itself.



Intangible assets such as goodwill cannot usually be sold individually in an open market but in some cases they may be acquired from other companies. They may also be paid for and transferred as part of an acquisition or merger deal. Intangible assets do contribute to a firm’s net worth and total value if they are recorded on the balance sheet but it is up to the firm to decide on any carrying value.




Types of Assets

Tangible Assets

Can be physically touched
May have "real world" use such as consumption or physical utilization
Are usually more difficult to store, manage, and insure
May have more stable value due to underlying need in society
May be difficult to transfer ownership if physical possession is required (i.e. shipping a delicate, rare collectible)



Intangible Assets

Can not be physically touched
Often does not have "real world" use such as consumption or physical utilization
Are usually easier to store, manage, and insure
May have less stable value due to lack of need in society
Usually easier to transfer ownership of as physical possession is not a consideration







What Is an Example of a Tangible Asset?
Consider the example of a car manufacturer preparing the assembly and distribution of a vehicle. The raw materials acquire are tangible assets, and the warehouse in which the raw materials are stored is also a tangible asset. The manufacturing building and equipment are tangible assets, and the finished vehicle to be sold is tangible inventory.




What Makes an Asset Tangible?
An item is tangible if it can be touched and has a real, physical presence. Some definitions of tangible may include the description that the asset can be seen, but this description could also be used to describe items you can’t touch (i.e. digital currency balances can be seen on a monitor).  




What Is the Difference Between a Tangible Asset and Intangible Asset?
Tangible assets can be touched, while intangible assets can’t. Many intangible assets are conceptual (i.e. goodwill), while tangible assets are items that actually have a physical presence and use in the real world (i.e. a company car). While it may be easier to store, protect, and transfer intangible assets, tangible assets may have a real world application and need.




What Is the Main Benefit of Tangible Assets?
Tangible assets have inherent value because of their usefulness in life. For example, land has value because it can be used for buildings, parks, agriculture, schools, community centers, parking lots, or homes for animals.The same can’t be said about intangible assets. The value of a single share of stock is the ownership property it represents. Although you may receive a piece of paper that states the ownership, the asset can’t be used for anything beyond its vehicle as an investment.


   The Bottom Line  

Companies own many different assets, and one type of asset a company may own is a tangible asset. Tangible assets are things that can be touched that also provide future economic benefit to the company. Though tangible assets have the benefit of having actual use in the real world, they also necessitate additional care for physical safeguarding and preservation.
What Is Tangible Book Value Per Share (TBVPS)?  

Tangible book value per share (TBVPS) is a method by which a company’s value is determined on a per-share basis by measuring its equity without the inclusion of any intangible assets. Intangible assets are those that lack physical substance, thus making their valuation a more difficult undertaking than the valuation of tangible assets.



TBVPS is similar to price-to-tangible book value (PTBV).





Key Takeaways

Tangible book value per share (TBVPS) is the value of a company’s tangible assets divided by its current outstanding shares.TBVPS determines the potential value per share of a company in the event that it must liquidate its assets. Assets such as property and equipment are considered tangible assets. Intangible assets, such as goodwill, are not included in the calculation of TBVPS. One of the criticisms of TBVPS’s validity is the lack of accuracy in the accounting of a company’s tangible assets.

   Understanding Tangible Book Value Per Share  

Tangible book value (TBV) of a company is what common shareholders can expect to receive if a firm goes bankrupt—thereby forcing the liquidation of its assets at the book value price. Intangible assets, such as goodwill, are not included in tangible book value because they cannot be sold during liquidation. However, companies with high tangible book values tend to offer shareholders more downside protection in the case of bankruptcy.



Tangible book value per share thus focuses solely on the value of an organization's tangible assets, such as buildings and equipment. Once the value of the tangible assets is determined, that amount is divided by the number of the company’s current outstanding shares. The amount determined in this process is recognized as the company’s TBVPS. 



TBV provides an estimate regarding the value of the company if it goes bankrupt and is forced to liquidate the entirety of its assets. Since certain intrinsic characteristics such as goodwill or employee knowledge cannot be liquidated for a price, TBV does not include intangible assets. The TBV applies only to physical items that can be handled and sold at an easily determined market value.






Certain online databases and websites allow potential investors to examine the progress of a company’s TBVPS over time. 


   Requirements for Tangible Book Value Per Share  

An organization's tangible assets can include any physical products the company produces, as well as any materials used to produce them. Should an organization be in the business of producing bicycles, for instance, any completed bicycles, unused bicycle parts, or raw materials used during the process of fabricating bicycles would qualify as tangible assets. The value of these assets is determined based on what price they would draw should the company be forced to liquidate, most commonly in the event of a bankruptcy.



Aside from assets related to the production of a product, any equipment used to create the product can be included as well. This can include any tools or machinery required to complete production, as well as any real estate owned and used for the purposes of production. Additional business equipment, such as computers and filing cabinets, may also be considered tangible assets for the purpose of valuation.


   Criticism of TBVPS  

Book value refers to the ratio of stockholder equity to the number of shares outstanding. It takes into account only the accounting valuation, which is not always an accurate reflection of the current market valuation, or of what could be received during a sale.
What Is Tangible Common Equity (TCE)?  

Tangible common equity (TCE) is a measure of a company's physical capital, which is used to evaluate a financial institution's ability to deal with potential losses. It is often used when analyzing financial firms that do not normally have a relatively large amount of tangible assets.



Tangible common equity is calculated by subtracting intangible assets (including goodwill) and preferred equity from the company's book value.





Key Takeaways

Tangible common equity (TCE) is a measure of a company's physical capital, which is used to evaluate a financial institution's ability to deal with potential losses.Measuring a company's TCE is particularly useful for evaluating companies that have large amounts of preferred stock, such as U.S. banks that received federal bailout money in the 2008 financial crisis.The TCE ratio (TCE divided by tangible assets) is a measure of capital adequacy at a bank. This ratio measures a firm's tangible common equity in terms of the firm's tangible assets.


   Understanding Tangible Common Equity  

Companies own both tangible (physical) and intangible assets. A building is tangible, for instance, while a patent is intangible. The same can be said about a firm's equity. Financial companies are most often evaluated using TCE.



Measuring a company's TCE is particularly useful for evaluating companies that have large amounts of preferred stock, such as U.S. banks that received federal bailout money in the 2008 financial crisis. In exchange for bailout funds, those banks issued large amounts of preferred stock to the federal government. A bank can boost TCE by converting preferred shares to common shares.



Using tangible common equity can also be used to calculate a capital adequacy ratio as one way of evaluating a bank's solvency and is considered a conservative measure of its stability.






TCE is not required by GAAP or bank regulations and is typically used internally as one of many capital adequacy indicators.


   Special Considerations  

The TCE ratio (TCE divided by tangible assets) is a measure of capital adequacy at a bank. The TCE ratio measures a firm's tangible common equity in terms of the firm's tangible assets. It can be used to estimate a bank's sustainable losses before shareholder equity is wiped out.



Depending on the firm's circumstances, patents might be excluded from intangible assets for the purposes of this equation since they, at times, can have a liquidation value.



Another way to evaluate a bank's solvency is to look at its tier 1 capital, which consists of common shares, preferred shares, retained earnings, and deferred tax assets. Banks and regulators track tier 1 capital levels to assess the stability of a bank.



Notably, lower risk assets held by a bank, such as U.S. Treasury notes, carry more safety than low-grade securities. Regulators do not require regular submissions of tier 1 capital levels, but they come into play when the Federal Reserve conducts stress tests on banks.


   Example of Tangible Common Equity  

Say that XYZ Bank had for the fiscal year 2021 a book value of $273.8 billion. Its goodwill was $69.01 billion, intangible assets $2.2 billion, and preferred stock $24 billion. Thus, XYZ Bank's tangible common equity at the end of 2021 was $178.59 billion ($273.8 billion - $69.01 billion - $2.2 billion - $24 billion).






Many banks break out tangible common equity in the supplemental documents on their financial statements.




What Does Tangible Common Equity Measure?
Tangible common equity is an estimation of the liquidation value of a firm, or what might be left over for distribution to shareholders if the firm were liquidated.




What Is the Tangible Common Equity Ratio Used For?
The tangible common equity ratio (TCE divided by tangible assets) can be used as a measure of leverage. High ratio values indicate less leverage and a larger amount of tangible equity compared to tangible assets.




When Is Tangible Common Equity Useful?
Tangible common equity is most often used when evaluating the position of financial companies like banks. It looks only at a firm's physical capital to evaluate a financial institution's ability to use them as collateral be able to cover potential losses.
What Is Tangible Net Worth?  

Tangible net worth is most commonly a calculation of the value of a company that excludes any value derived from intangible assets such as copyrights, patents, and intellectual property.



For an individual, the tangible net worth calculation includes home equity, any other real estate holdings, bank and investment accounts, and major personal assets such as an automobile or jewelry. Relatively insignificant personal assets are not ordinarily included in the calculation for an individual.

Tangible net worth is calculated as follows:



Locate the company's total assets, total liabilities, and intangible assets, which are all listed on the balance sheet.
Take total assets and subtract total liabilities.
Take the result and subtract intangible assets.



Tangible net worth can also be calculated for individuals, using the same formula of total tangible assets minus total debt liabilities.





Key Takeaways

Tangible net worth is typically the net worth of a company excluding intangible assets such as copyrights, patents, and intellectual property.The tangible net worth calculation for a company is total assets minus total liabilities minus intangible assets.Tangible net worth can also be calculated for individuals, using the same formula of total tangible assets minus total debt liabilities.


   What Tangible Net Worth Can Tell You  

Tangible net worth for a company is essentially the total value of a company's physical assets. These assets can include:



Cash
Accounts receivables or money owed to a company from its customers for sales
Inventory, such as finished goods
Equipment, such as machinery and computers
Buildings
Real estate
Investments



The tangible net worth calculation is designed to represent the total value of a company's physical assets net of its outstanding liabilities, as based on figures shown in the company's balance sheet. In effect, it indicates an approximation of the liquidation value of the company in the event of bankruptcy or sale.



The primary positive of the tangible net worth calculation is that it is simpler to do than a total net worth calculation, as it is easier to place an accurate value on physical assets than it is to evaluate intangible assets such as customer goodwill or intellectual property. Intellectual property includes things such as proprietary technology or designs.



Tangible net worth is a factor often considered by a lender from whom a company or individual is seeking financing. Typically, banks and creditors will use physical assets of a company to secure a borrowing facility. If the company fails to make payments or defaults, the bank can legally seize the assets. The tangible net worth calculation helps creditors determine the size and terms of the borrowing facility so that they don't lend more than the company's assets are worth.

   Limitations of Using Tangible Net Worth  

A drawback of using tangible net worth is that it may fall substantially short as a representation of actual net worth in cases where a company or an individual has intangible assets of considerable value. For example, a major computer software firm such as Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT) may possess a wealth of intellectual property rights and other intangible assets that are worth billions of dollars, which would be excluded from the tangible net worth calculation.



One item that can complicate the tangible net worth calculation is subordinated debt, debt that in the event of a default or liquidation is only repaid after all debt obligations to senior debt holders have been satisfied. A simple example of subordinated debt is a secondary mortgage held on real estate.



The secondary mortgage is only repaid after the debt represented by the primary mortgage is paid off. If the value of the property on which a company or individual holds subordinated debt is not sufficient to retire that debt in addition to the debt owed to senior and primary debt holders, then the subordinated debt should not be included in the calculation of tangible net worth.
What is Tangible Personal Property?  

Tangible personal property is a tax term describing personal property that can be physically relocated, such as furniture and office equipment. Tangible personal property is always depreciated over either a five- or seven-year period using straight-line depreciation but is eligible for accelerated depreciation as well.



Tangible personal property is anything other than real property (land and building) that is used in the operations of a business or rental property.


   Understanding Tangible Personal Property  

Tangible personal property is the opposite of real property, in a sense, as real property is immovable. In comparison to intangible personal property, tangible property can be touched. Consider property such as furniture, machinery, cell phones, computers, and collectibles which can be felt compared to intangibles such as patents, copyrights, and non-compete agreements that cannot be seen or touched.





Key Takeaways

Tangible personal property includes a wide variety of equipment, from small office fixtures to light trucks and buses.Tangible property also includes all miscellaneous assets that do not inherently qualify for any other class life, such as jewelry, toys, and sports equipment.Tangible personal property represents anything that may be used like a desk, bed, lamps, or other furnishing for a rented home or business.



Tangible personal property is subject to ad valorem taxes. In most states, a business that owned tangible property on January 1 must file a tax return form with the property appraisal office no later than April 1 in the same year. The property appraiser places a value on the property, and the tax amount due is calculated by multiplying the property value by the tax rate set by the tax authorities in the state.






Property owners who lease or rent tangible personal property must also file this return for tax purposes.



Some counties and cities require the filer to list all property on the tax form and to provide the fair market value and cost for each tangible property. In these cases, the county will also provide a valuation table that can be used to estimate the value of the property based on its age and useful life. Some states only apply a tax on tangible property in the year the property was purchased.


   Example of Taxes and Tangible Personal Property  

Any new business-owning tangible property on January 1 must file an initial tax return on the property. After the initial year of filing, if the assessed value of the personal property exceeds $25,000 in any given year, the business is required to file a tax return. A letter from the property appraisal office will usually be sent by mail to the company notifying it to file taxes on its property. If the company or landlord believes the letter is not applicable, the letter may be returned to the office with another letter explaining why taxes on tangible personal property does not apply to the business.



Tangible personal property tax is paid by a landlord or company to its local government, but landlords or company owners can claim a deduction on federal income tax returns. To claim the deduction, the tax must only apply to personal property owned and bought for the business’ operation, be based on its fair market value, and be charged on an annual basis (as opposed to a one-time basis).
What Is Tape Reading?  

Tape reading is an old technique that day traders used to analyze the price and volume of a given stock. From roughly the 1860s through the 1960s, stock prices were transmitted over telegraph lines on ticker tape that included a ticker symbol, price, and volume. These technologies were phased out in the 1960s with the rise of personal computers and electronic communication networks (ECNs).





Key Takeaways

Tape reading was the way that day traders used to analyze the price and volume of a given stock before the technology was replaced.A stock's ticker symbol, price, and volume were sent over telegraph lines via ticker tape.While tape reading was phased out in the 1960s, similar strategies are used by electronic traders, and many of the terms originating from the time are still widely used.


   Understanding Tape Reading  

Ticker tapes were invented in 1867 by Edward A. Calahan for the Gold and Stock Telegraph Company. Thomas Edison developed the first practical stock ticker in 1871 that helped the market became more efficient.﻿﻿ These machines were soon installed across all major brokerages as the primary means of price and volume dissemination.



Many famous traders made a name for themselves by tape reading, including Jesse Livermore who pioneered momentum trading. Several books were also published about tape reading, including Tape Reading and Market Tactics and Reminiscences of a Stock Operator. Many terms also remain in common use since then, including ticker symbol, stock ticker, and phrases like “don’t fight the tape” (meaning don’t trade against the trend).



Tape reading eventually became obsolete in the 1960s and 1970s with the rise of television and computers, but the terms ticker symbol and stock tickers remain in use and traders employ many of the same techniques with more modern technology.






While the rise of personal computers made old-fashioned tape reading obsolete, much of the terminology of that time remains in today's trading vernacular, such as "ticker symbol," "stock ticker," and "don't fight the tape."


   Modern Tape Reading  

Modern tape reading involves looking at electronic order books to analyze where a stock price may be headed. Unlike stock tickers, these order books include non-executed trades, which provides a higher level of detail into the market at any given time.



For example, a trader may look at a security’s order book and see that there are large limit sell orders at a certain price level across multiple exchanges. This may indicate that the stock will experience significant resistance at these levels. The opposite may be true if there are large limit buy orders below the current price, which could indicate strong support at a given price point and give a trader the confidence to buy knowing there’s a price floor.



Many brokers provide access to these order books in the form of Level II quotes. In advanced cases, programmatic traders may use the information when building trading algorithms. Interactive Brokers, for example, provides a function called “reqMktDepth” that lets traders stream order book data for analysis.﻿﻿ These insights can prove extremely helpful when developing modern trading algorithms.
What Is the Taper Tantrum?  

The phrase, taper tantrum, describes the 2013 surge in U.S. Treasury yields, resulting from the Federal Reserve's (Fed) announcement of future tapering of its policy of quantitative easing. The Fed announced that it would be reducing the pace of its purchases of Treasury bonds, to reduce the amount of money it was feeding into the economy. The ensuing rise in bond yields in reaction to the announcement was referred to as a taper tantrum in financial media.  





Key Takeaways

Taper tantrum refers to the 2013 collective reactionary panic that triggered a spike in U.S. Treasury yields, after investors learned that the Federal Reserve was slowly putting the brakes on its quantitative easing (QE) program.The main worry behind the taper tantrum stemmed from fears that the market would crumble, as the result of the cessation of QE.In the end, the taper tantrum panic was unjustified, as the market continued to recover after the tapering program began.


   Understanding Taper Tantrum  

In reaction to the 2008 financial crisis and ensuing recession, the Federal Reserve executed a policy known as quantitative easing (QE), which involves large purchases of bonds and other securities. In theory, this increases liquidity in the financial sector to maintain stability and promote economic growth. Stabilizing the financial sector encouraged lending, to allow consumers to spend and businesses to invest. 



Historically, quantitative easing, the monetary policy designed to infuse more dollars into the circulation of the economy, has been considered only usable as a short-term fix because of the danger that could arise from falling dollar values leading to hyperinflation. Traditional economists would insist that when the Federal Reserve feeds the economy for too long, there are unavoidable consequences. Tapering, which gradually reduces the amount of money the Fed pumps into the economy, should theoretically incrementally reduce the economy's reliance on that money and allow the Fed to remove itself as the economy's crutch.



However, since 2015, the Fed has found a variety of ways to infuse cash into the economy without lowering the value of the dollar. These new policy tools, such as the repurchase window, may have ushered in a new chapter in the future study of macroeconomic policy, though it will be several years before economists and academics, in hindsight, will be willing to declare such tools effective or dangerous.However, investor behavior always involves not just current conditions, but expectations of future economic performance and Fed policy. If the public gets word that the Fed is planning to engage in tapering, panic can still ensue, because people worry that the lack of money will trigger market instability. This is particularly a problem the more dependent the market has become on continued Fed support. 


   What Caused the 2013 Taper Tantrum?  

In 2013, Federal Reserve Chair Ben Bernanke announced that the Fed would, at some future date, reduce the volume of its bond purchases. In the period since the 2008 financial crisis the Fed had tripled the size of its balance sheet from around $1 trillion to around $3 trillion by purchasing almost $2 trillion in Treasury bonds and other financial assets to prop up the market. Investors had come to depend on ongoing massive Fed support for asset prices through its ongoing purchases. 



This prospective policy of reducing the rate of Fed asset purchases represented a massive negative shock to investor expectations, as the Fed had become one of the worlds biggest buyers. As with any reduction in demand, with reduced Fed purchases (bond) prices would fall. Bond investors responded immediately to the prospect of future decline in bond prices by selling bonds, depressing the price of bonds as a result. Of course, falling bond prices always mean higher yields, so yields on U.S. Treasuries shot up. 



It is important to note that no actual sell-off of Fed assets or tapering of the Fed’s quantitative easing policy had occurred at this point. Chair Bernanke’s comments referred only to the possibility that at some future date the Fed might do so. The extreme bond market reaction at the time to a mere possibility of less support in the future underscored the degree to which bond markets had become addicted to Fed stimulus. 



Many pundits believed that the stock market could follow suit, since the money flowing into the economy from the Fed through bond purchases was also widely understood to be supporting stock prices. If so, this market reaction to the prospect for Fed tapering could potentially sink the economy. Instead, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) made only temporary declines in mid-2013.












Investopedia / Laura Porter


   Why Didn’t the Stock Market Fall During the Taper Tantrum?  

There were many reasons for the stock market's continued health. For one, following Chair Bernanke’s comments, the Fed did not actually slow its QE purchasing, but instead launched into a 3rd round of massive bond purchases, totaling another $1.5 trillion by 2015. Secondly, the Fed professed a strong faith in market recovery, boosting investor sentiment and actively managing investor expectations through regular policy announcements. Once investors realized that there was no reason to panic, the stock market leveled out.
What Is Tapering?  

Tapering modifies a central bank's monetary expansion policies initiated to stimulate an economy. During a program of quantitative easing, a nation's central bank may buy asset-backed securities from its member banks, injecting money into the economy, to boost recovery.



Tapering is initiated after the quantitative easing policies have stabilized an economy and may include changing the discount rate or reserve requirements. In the United States, the Federal Reserve will also reduce its asset holdings.





Key Takeaways

Tapering is the reversal of quantitative easing policies, implemented by a central bank and intended to stimulate economic growth.Tapering refers specifically to the reduction of central bank assets.Financial markets may experience a downturn in response to tapering, known as a "taper tantrum."

   How Tapering Affects Financial Markets  

When central banks pursue an expansionary policy to stimulate an economy in a recession, they promise to reverse their stimulatory policies once the economy has recovered. Continuing to stimulate an economy with easy money once a recession has eased can lead to inflation and monetary policy-driven asset price bubbles.



Tapering is the first step in the process of either winding down or withdrawing from a monetary stimulus program that has already been executed and deemed successful. Communicating openly with investors regarding the direction of central bank policy and future activities helps to set market expectations and reduce market uncertainty.



In the case of quantitative easing, the central bank would announce its plans to slow asset purchases and either sell off or allow assets to mature, thus reducing the amount of total central bank assets and the money supply.



Central banks can hesitate to pull back on their QE policies due to "taper tantrums," where investors and financial markets overreact to a reduction in stimulus from the central bank.



For example, announcements of impending central bank tapering have typically been met with sharp rises in government bond yields and drops in equity markets, creating an incentive for monetary policymakers to delay plans to unwind their balance sheets to avoid harming the interests of their constituents in the financial sector.


   Federal Reserve Tapering and Financial Assets  

As the COVID-19 pandemic emerged in March 2020, the Fed implemented an aggressive quantitative easing strategy, injecting more than $700 billion in asset purchases, and by June 2020 established a QE program to purchase $80 billion in Treasury securities and $40 billion in mortgage-backed securities per month.



The Fed started tapering its purchases in December 2021 and by the spring of 2021, the economy showed significant strength and a cost-of-living surge.



In June 2022, the Federal Reserve changed its monetary policy direction to manage the threat of rising costs. The Fed revised its position after two years of an “easy money” policy, ending its policy of low-interest rates and significant intervention in the bond market.



The Fed also put in place a plan to reduce its balance sheet of nearly $9 trillion in asset holdings it accumulated in recent years, mostly Treasury and mortgage-backed securities the beginning of the Fed’s money-tightening measures.




When Does Tapering Begin?
The Fed implements quantitative easing as one of its tools to stimulate the economy. Like all economic stimulus programs, QE policies are not intended to be permanent and after the desired results of an economic stimulus program have been achieved, those policies must be gradually rescinded. If a central bank changes its operations too fast, it can push the economy into a recession. If a central bank never eases its economic stimulus policies, there may be an increase in inflation. Tapering is the period where the stimulus has worked and before an accelerated expansion toward inflation.




What Is the Difference Between Tapering and Tightening?
Tight, or contractionary policy is a course of action by a central bank to slow down economic growth, constrict spending in an economy that is seen to be accelerating too quickly, or curb inflation when it is rising too fast. The Fed tightens monetary policy by raising short-term interest rates through policy changes to the discount rate, also known as the federal funds rate. The Fed may also sell assets on the central bank's balance sheet to the market through open market operations (OMO). Tapering refers to the period of reversal between expansionary policy and contractionary monetary policy.




Where Was Tapering Evident in Response to the 2007-2008 Financial Crisis?
Tapering by the Fed followed the massive QE program implemented in reaction to the 2007-08 financial crisis. Tapering was evident in June 2013 when the former Chair of the Fed, Ben Bernanke, announced that the Fed would reduce the number of assets purchased every month as long as economic conditions, such as inflation and unemployment, were favorable.As 2013 drew to a close, the Federal Reserve Board concluded that QE, which had increased the Fed's balance sheet to $4.5 trillion, had achieved its intended goal, and it was time for tapering to commence. The process of tapering would involve making smaller bond purchases through October 2014.


   The Bottom Line  

Tapering is withdrawing from a monetary stimulus program that has been executed and quantitative easing policies have stabilized the economy. Tapering may include changing the discount rate or reserve requirements and the Federal Reserve will also reduce its asset holdings.
What Is a Target-Date Fund?  

Target-date funds are structured to maximize the investor's returns by a specific date. Generally, the funds are designed to build gains in the early years by focusing on riskier growth stocks, then they aim to retain those gains by weighting towards safer, more conservative choices as the target date approaches.



Target-date mutual funds are often selected by investors saving towards retirement but are also used by people working towards a future big expense such as a child's college tuition.





Key Takeaways

A target-date fund is a class of mutual funds or ETFs that periodically rebalances asset class weights to optimize risk and returns for a predetermined time frame.The asset allocation of a target-date fund is typically designed to gradually shift to a more conservative profile so as to minimize risk when the target date approaches.The appeal of target-date funds is that they offer investors the convenience of putting their investing activities on autopilot in one vehicle.Target-date funds usually mature in 5-year intervals, such as 2035, 2040, and 2045.While relatively more expensive than other types of mutual fund, expense ratios on target-date funds have come down significantly in recent years.


   How a Target-Date Fund Works  

Target date funds use a traditional portfolio management methodology to target asset allocation over the term of the fund to meet the investment return objective. Named by the year in which the investor plans to begin utilizing the assets, target-date funds are considered to be extremely long-term investments. For example, in July 2017, Vanguard launched its Target Retirement 2065 products. Given that the funds have a targeted utilization date of 2065 that gives them a time horizon of 48 years.



A fund's portfolio managers use this predetermined time horizon to fashion their investment strategy, generally based on traditional asset allocation models. The fund managers also use the target date to determine the degree of risk the fund is willing to undertake. Target-date portfolio managers typically readjust portfolio risk levels annually.


   Special Considerations  

Following the initial launch, a target-date fund has a high tolerance for risk and therefore is more heavily weighted toward high-performing but speculative assets. At the annual adjustment, portfolio managers will reset the allocation of investment categories.



A target-date fund’s portfolio mix of assets and degree of risk become more conservative as it approaches its objective target date. Higher-risk portfolio investments typically include domestic and global equities. Lower risk portions of a target-date portfolio typically include fixed-income investments such as bonds and cash equivalents.



Most fund marketing materials show the allocation glide path—that is, the shift of assets—across the entire investment time horizon. The funds structure their glide rate to achieve the most conservative allocation right at the specified target date.



Some target-date funds, known as (To funds) will also manage funds to a specified asset allocation past the target date. In the years beyond the target date, allocations are more heavily weighted toward low-risk, fixed-income investments. Some target-date funds, known as “through” funds, will also manage funds to a specified asset allocation past the target date. This is in contrast to other target-date funds, known as "to funds," which will cease any modifications to asset allocation once the target date is reached.






Today, target-date funds are only offered as mutual funds. There are no equivalent ETFs listed at the moment.


   Advantages and Disadvantages of Target-Date Funds  
  Advantages  

Target-date funds are popular with 401(k) plan investors. Instead of having to choose several investments to create a portfolio that will help them reach their retirement goals, investors choose a single target-date fund to match their time horizon. For example, a younger worker hoping to retire in 2065 would choose a target-date 2065 fund, while an older worker hoping to retire in 2025 would choose a target-date 2025 fund.



These funds mitigate the need for other assets. Some financial professionals advise that if you invest in one, it should be the only investment in your plan. This one-and-done approach is because additional investments could skew your overall portfolio allocation. However, after you've picked a fund, you have the ultimate set-it-and-forget-it investment.


  Disadvantages  

Of course, the autopilot nature of target-date funds can cut both ways. The predetermined shifting of the portfolio assets may not suit an individual's changing goals and needs. People grow and change, and so do their needs.



What if you have to retire substantially earlier than the target date—or decide you want to keep working longer? Also, there is no guarantee that the fund's earnings will keep up with inflation. In fact, there are no guarantees that the fund will generate a certain amount of income or gains at all. A target-date fund is an investment, not an annuity. As with all investments, these funds are subject to risk and underperformance.



Furthermore, as investments go, target-date funds can be expensive. They are technically a fund of funds (FoF)—a fund that invests in other mutual funds or exchange-traded funds—which means you have to pay the expense ratios of those underlying assets, as well as the fees of the target-date fund.



Of course, an increasing number of funds are no-load, and overall, fee rates have been decreasing. Still, it is something to watch out for, especially if your fund invests in a lot of passively managed vehicles. Why pay double fees on index funds, when you could buy and hold them on your own?



Also, it's worth bearing in mind that similarly named target-date funds are not the same—or, more specifically, their assets are not the same. Yes, all 2045 target-date funds will be heavily weighted toward equities, but some might opt for domestic stocks, while others look to international stocks. Some might go for investment-grade bonds, and others choose high-yield, lower-grade debt instruments. Make sure the fund's portfolio of assets fits your comfort level and own appetite for risk.





Pros

The ultimate autopilot way to invest
All-in-one vehicle—no need for other assets
A diversified portfolio



Cons

Higher expenses than other passive investments
Income not guaranteed
Possibly insufficient inflation hedge
Little room for changing investor goals, needs





   Example of Target-Date Funds  

Vanguard is one investment manager offering a comprehensive series of target-date funds. Below we compare the characteristics of the Vanguard 2065 (VLXVX) fund to the characteristics of the Vanguard 2025 fund (VTTVX).



The Vanguard Target Retirement 2065 Fund (VLXVX) has an expense ratio of 0.15%. As of Q2 2022, the portfolio allocation was 90.5% in stocks and 9.5% in bonds. It holds other Vanguard mutual funds to achieve its goals. It had 53.8% invested in the Vanguard Total Stock Market Index, 36.6% invested in the Vanguard Total International Stock Index Fund, 6.7% invested in the Vanguard Total Bond Market II Index Fund, and 2.9% invested in the Vanguard Total International Bond Index Fund.



The Vanguard Target Retirement 2025 Fund (VTTVX) has an expense ratio of 0.08%. Because it matures 20 years in advance of the 2065 fund, it is more conservative. As of Q2 2022, its portfolio is weighted 57.5% in stocks and 42.5% in bonds. It has allocated 34.7% of assets to the Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund, 27.6% to the Vanguard Total Bond Market II Index Fund, 22.7% to the Vanguard Total International Stock Index Fund, 12.2% to the Vanguard Total International Bond Index Fund, and 2.80% to the Vanguard Short-Term Inflation-Protected Securities Index Fund.



Both funds invest in the same assets. However, the 2065 Fund is more heavily weighted toward stocks, with a relatively smaller percentage of bonds and cash equivalents. The 2025 Fund has greater weight in fixed income and fewer stocks, so it is less volatile and more likely to contain the assets the investor needs to begin making withdrawals in 2025.



In the years beyond the target date, both Vanguard target-date funds will preserve an asset allocation mix of approximately 20% in U.S. equities, 10% in international equities, 40% in U.S. bonds, 10% in international bonds, and about 20% in short-term TIPS.




Can I Hold Onto a Target-Date Fund After the Target Date?
Yes. However, it may behave differently depending on the type of target-date fund you have. A "through fund" will continue adjusting its asset allocation toward more conservative holdings as time passes; a "to-fund" will retain its final asset allocation as of its maturation date indefinitely.




Are Target-Date Funds Expensive?
In general, a target-date fund will have somewhat higher expense ratios compared to a standard mutual fund. This is because the target-date fund, even if it is an index target-date fund, is essentially a fund-of-funds that invests in other mutual funds. Moreover, the fund has to rebalance its portfolio regularly to match the glide path so it is more active than a standard index fund. That said, many target-date index funds available today have low expense ratios of 0.10% or lower.




Can I Use a Target-Date Fund in My 401(k) or Individual Retirement Account?
Yes. Most plan providers today offer access to target-date funds. However, for these to work properly be careful to only use a target-date fund for nearly all of your allocations. This is because if you allocate money to other investments it may defeat the purpose of the glide path provided in the target-date fund.




What Target-Date Fund Should I Pick If I Plan to Retire in a Year Not Ending in -5 or -0?
Most target-date funds are established in 5-year intervals (e.g., maturing in 2030, 2035, 2040, 2045, and so on). There is no set rule if you plan to retire in say, 2033. You can round up to the 2035 fund, or if you have a lower risk tolerance, use the nearer-term 2030 one. You can also choose to put something like 60% of your allocation in 2035 fund and 40% in the 2030 fund.
What Is a Target Market?  

A target market is a group of people that have been identified as the most likely potential customers for a product because of their shared characteristics, such as age, income, and lifestyle.



Identifying the target market is a key part of the decision-making process when a company designs, packages, and advertises its product.





Key Takeaways

A target market is a group of customers with shared demographics who have been identified as the most likely buyers of a company's product or service.Identifying the target market is important in the development and implementation of a successful marketing plan for any new product.The target market also can inform a product's specifications, packaging, and distribution.


   How Do I Define My Product's Target Market?  

Part of creating a new product is envisioning the consumers who will want it.



A new product must satisfy a need or solve a problem, or both. That need or problem is probably not universal unless it reaches the level of indoor plumbing. More likely, it is needed by a subset of consumers, such as environmentally-conscious vegetarians, or science nerds, or outdoor enthusiasts. It may appeal to a teenager or a middle-aged professional, a bargain-hunter or a snob.



Envisioning your likely target market is part of the process of creating and refining a product, and informs decisions about its packaging, marketing, and placement.


   What Are the 4 Target Markets?  

Marketing professionals divide consumers into four major segments:



Demographic: These are the main characteristics that define your target market. Everyone can be identified as belonging to a specific age group, income level, gender, occupation, and education level.



Geographic: This segment is increasingly relevant in the era of globalization. Regional preferences need to be taken into account.



Psychographic: This segment goes beyond the basics of demographics to consider lifestyle, attitudes, interests, and values.



Behavioral: This is the one segment that relies on research into the decisions of a company's current customers. New products may be introduced based on research into the proven appeal of past products.


   What Is an Example of a Target Market?  

Each of the four target markets can be used to consider who the customer for a new product is.



For example, there are an estimated 100,000 Italian restaurants in the U.S. Clearly, they have enormous appeal.



But a corner pizza joint might appeal mostly, although by no means entirely, to a younger and more budget-conscious consumer, while an old-fashioned white tablecloth place might be dominated by older folks and families who live in the neighborhood. Meanwhile, a newer place down the street might cater to an upscale and trend-conscious crowd who will travel a good distance for the restaurant's innovative menu and fancy wine list.



In each successful case, a savvy business person has consciously considered the ideal target market for the restaurant and has tweaked the menu, decor, and advertising strategy to appeal to that market.


   Why Are Target Markets Important?  

Few products today are designed to appeal to absolutely everyone. The Aveda Rosemary Mint Bath Bar, available for $23 a bar at Aveda beauty stores, is marketed to the upscale and eco-conscious woman who will pay extra for quality. Cle de Peau Beaute Synactif Soap retails for $110 a bar and is marketed to wealthy, fashion-conscious women who are willing to pay a premium for a luxury product. An eight-pack of Dial soap costs under $5 on Amazon, and it is known to get the job done.



Part of the success of selling a good or service is knowing to whom it will appeal and who will ultimately buy it. Its user base can grow over time through additional marketing, advertising, and word of mouth.



That's why businesses spend a lot of time and money in defining their initial target markets, and why they follow through with special offers, social media campaigns, and specialized advertising.


   What Are Market Segments?  

Dividing a target market into segments means grouping the population according to the key characteristics that drive their spending decisions. Some of these are gender, age, income level, race, education level, religion, marital status, and geographic location.



Consumers with the same demographics tend to value the same products and services, which is why narrowing down the segments is one of the most important factors in determining target markets.



For example, people who fall into a higher income bracket may be more likely to buy specialty coffee from Starbucks instead of Dunkin' Donuts. The parent companies of both of these brands need to know that in order to decide where to locate their stores, where to stock their products, and where to advertise their brand.






A business may have more than one target market—a primary target market, which is the main focus, and a secondary target market, which is smaller but has growth potential. Toy commercials are targeted directly to children. Their parents are the secondary market.


   Target Market and Product Sales  

Identifying the target market is an essential part of a product development plan, along with manufacturing, distribution, price, and promotion planning. The target market determines significant factors about the product itself. A company may tweak certain aspects of a product, such as the amount of sugar in a soft drink or the style of the packaging, so that it appeals more to consumers in its target group.



As a company’s product sales grow, it may expand its target market internationally. International expansion allows a company to reach a broader subset of its target market in other regions of the world.



In addition to international expansion, a company may find its domestic target market expands as its products gain more traction in the marketplace. Expanding a product's target market is a revenue opportunity worth pursuing.




How Detailed Should a Target Market Be?
It depends. Broadly speaking, a product may be designed for a mass market or a niche market, and a niche market can be a very small group indeed, especially in a product's early introductory phase.Some carbonated beverages aim for a practically universal market. Coca-Cola had to branch out to 200 markets abroad to continue growing its customer base. Gatorade is owned by Pepsi Cola, but the brand is positioned as a drink for athletes. The soda brand Poppi, which is branded as a "Healthy, Sparkling, Prebiotic Soda with Real Fruit Juice, Gut Health, and Immunity Benefits," is clearly aimed at a younger, healthier, and more trend-conscious target market.




What Is an Example of a Target Market?
Consider a casual apparel company that is working to build its distribution channels abroad. In order to determine where its apparel will be most successful, it conducts some research to identify its primary target market. It discovers that the people most likely to buy their products are middle-class women between the ages of 35 and 55 who live in cold climates.It's reasonable for the company to focus its advertising efforts on northern European websites that have a strong female audience.But first, the company may consider how its apparel can be most attractive to that target market. It may revise its styles and colors and tweak its advertising strategy to optimize its appeal to this new prospective market.




What Is the Purpose of a Target Market?
A target market defines a product as well as vice versa.Once a target market is identified, it can influence a product's design, packaging, price, promotion, and distribution.A product aimed at men won't be packaged in pink plastic. A luxury cosmetic won't be sold in a pharmacy. An expensive pair of shoes comes with a branded cloth drawstring bag as well as a shoebox. All of those factors are signals to the target audience that they have found the right product.


   The Bottom Line  

Identifying the target market is part of the process of creating and refining a new product.



A target market can be translated into a profile of the consumer to whom a product is most likely to appeal. The profile considers four main characteristics of that person: demographic, geographic, psychographic, and behavioral.
What Is a Targeted Accrual Redemption Note?  

A targeted accrual redemption note (TARN) is an exotic derivative that terminates when a limit on coupon payments to the holder is reached.



Target accrual redemption notes (TARN) have the distinguishing feature of being subject to early termination. If the accumulation of coupons reaches a predetermined amount before the settlement date, the holder of the note receives a final payment of the par value and the contract ends.





Key Takeaways

A targeted accrual redemption note (TARN) is an index-linked derivative containing a target cap.The cap refers to the maximum amount of accumulated coupon payments received.Once the cap has been reached, the note automatically terminates.FX-TARNS are linked to an index of currencies rather than equities.


   Understanding Targeted Accrual Redemption Notes (TARNs)  

A targeted accrual redemption note is essentially an index-linked note that has a set amount of coupons that represent the target cap. After the target cap is reached, the note will be terminated with the par of the note being paid. So there is usually an attractive initial coupon combined with the possibility of getting back the par value relatively fast. An index-linked note an investment product that combines a fixed-income investment with additional potential returns that are tied to the performance of an equity index such as the S&P 500 index. 



Aside from these index-linked features, TARNs are similar to inverse floating-rate notes where the benchmark may be LIBOR, Euribor, or a similar rate. TARNs can also be conceptualized as path-dependent options: the end-user in effect buys a strip of call options while selling a strip of put options with a notional value that is double the calls'. The contract may include a knock-out provision that terminates it if the benchmark reaches a certain level. 



Foreign exchange TARNs or FX-TARNs are a common form of TARN in which counterparties exchange currencies at a pre-determined rate on pre-determined dates. The amount of currency exchanged varies depending on whether the rate is above or below a set forward price. 


   Valuation of Targeted Accrual Redemption Notes (TARNs)  

The valuation of targeted accrual redemption notes can be challenging because the redemption timelines are dependent on the coupons received to date. Once the knock-out level is reached, the investment is ended and the principal is repaid. From an investor's perspective, a great initial coupon rate for a time and an early return of capital is an ideal outcome. However, depending on how the indexed rates perform, an investor may be stuck in the investment and see the time value of money erode what was once an attractive shorter-term investment.



Generally speaking, the value of a note is the present value of the par and coupon payments. However, there is uncertainty with targeted accrual redemption notes because not all coupon payments will necessarily be received. So instead of a linear calculation on present value, a TARN requires a simulation of interest rate volatility to assess the probability of triggering the knock-out level given the terms of the note. TARNs tied to volatile benchmarks will necessarily be more difficult to accurately value.
What Is a Tariff?  

Most countries are limited by their natural resources and ability to produce certain goods and services. They trade with other countries to get what their population needs and demands. However, trade isn't always conducted in an amenable manner between trading partners. Policies, geopolitics, competition, and many other factors can make trading partners unhappy.



One of the ways governments deal with trading partners they disagree with is through tariffs. A tariff is a tax imposed by one country on the goods and services imported from another country to influence it, raise revenues, or protect competitive advantages.





Key Takeaways

Governments impose tariffs to raise revenue, protect domestic industries, or exert political leverage over another country.Tariffs often result in unwanted side effects, such as higher consumer prices.Tariffs have a long and contentious history, and the debate over whether they represent good or bad policy still rages.

   Understanding Tariffs  

Tariffs are used to restrict imports. Simply put, they increase the price of goods and services purchased from another country, making them less attractive to domestic consumers.



A key point to understand is that a tariff affects the exporting country because consumers in the country that imposed the tariff might shy away from imports due to the price increase. However, if the consumer still chooses the imported product, then the tariff has essentially raised the cost to the consumer in another country.



There are two types of tariffs:



A specific tariff is levied as a fixed fee based on the type of item, such as a $500 tariff on a car.
An ad-valorem tariff is levied based on the item's value, such as 5% of an import's value.


   Why Governments Impose Tariffs  

Governments may impose tariffs for several reasons:



Raise revenuesProtect domestic industriesProtect domestic consumersProtect national interests


  Raise Revenues  

Tariffs can be used to raise revenues for governments. This kind of tariff is called a revenue tariff and is not designed to restrict imports. For instance, in 2018 and 2019, President Donald Trump and his administration imposed tariffs on many items to rebalance the trade deficit. In the fiscal year 2019, customs duties received were $18 billion. In FY 2020, duties received were $21 billion.


  Protect Domestic Industries  

Governments can use tariffs to benefit particular industries, often doing so to protect companies and jobs. For example, in May 2022, President Joe Biden proposed a 25% ad valorem tariff on steel articles from all countries except Canada, Mexico, and the United Kingdom (the U.K. has a quota of an aggregate of 500,000 metric tons it can trade with the U.S.).



This proclamation reopens the trade of specific items with the U.K. while taking measures to protect domestic U.S. steel manufacturing and production jobs.


  Protect Domestic Consumers  

By making foreign-produced goods more expensive, tariffs can make domestically produced alternatives seem more attractive. Some products made in countries with fewer regulations can harm consumers, such as a product coated in lead-based paint. Tariffs can make these products so expensive that consumers won't buy them.


  Protect National Interests  

Tariffs can also be used as an extension of foreign policy as their imposition on a trading partner's main exports may be used to exert economic leverage. For example, when Russia invaded Ukraine, much of the world protested by boycotting Russian goods or imposing sanctions. In April 2022, President Joe Biden suspended normal trade with Russia. In June, he raised the tariff on Russian imports not prohibited by the April suspension to 35%.


   Unintended Side Effects of Tariffs  

Tariffs can have unintended side effects:



They can make domestic industries less efficient and innovative by reducing competition.
They can hurt domestic consumers since a lack of competition tends to push up prices.
They can generate tensions by favoring specific industries or geographic regions over others. For example, tariffs designed to help manufacturers in cities may hurt consumers in rural areas who do not benefit from the policy and are likely to pay more for manufactured goods.
Finally, an attempt to pressure a rival country by using tariffs can devolve into an unproductive cycle of retaliation, commonly known as a trade war.


   Advantages and Disadvantages of Tariffs  



Pros

Produce revenues
Open negotiations
Support a nation's goals
Make a market predictable



Cons

Created issues between goverments
Initiates trade wars





  Advantages Explained  

Produce revenues: As discussed, tariffs provide a government a chance to bring in more money. This can relieve some of the tax burdens felt by a county's citizens and help the government to reduce deficits.Open negotiations: Tariffs can be used by countries to open negotiations for trade or other issues. Each side can use tariffs to help them create economic policies and talk with trade partners.Support a nation's goals: One of the most popular uses for tariffs is to use them to ensure domestic products receive preference within a country to support businesses and the economy.Make a market predictable: Tariffs can help stablize a market and make prices predictable.


  Disadvantages Explained  

Create issues between governments: Many nations use tariffs to punish or discourage actions they disapprove of. Unfortunately, doing this can create tensions between two countries and lead to more problems.Initiate trade wars: A typical response for a country with tariffs imposed on it is to respond similarly, creating a trade war in which neither country benefits from the other.


   History of Tariffs  
  Pre-Modern Europe  

In pre-modern Europe, a nation's wealth was believed to consist of fixed, tangible assets, such as gold, silver, land, and other physical resources. Trade was seen as a zero-sum game that resulted in either a clear net loss or a clear net gain of wealth. If a country imported more than it exported, a resource, mainly gold, would flow abroad, thereby draining its wealth. Cross-border trade was viewed with suspicion, and countries preferred to acquire colonies with which they could establish exclusive trading relationships rather than trading with each other. 



This system, known as mercantilism, relied heavily on tariffs and even outright bans on trade. The colonizing country, which saw itself as competing with other colonizers, would import raw materials from its colonies, which were generally barred from selling their raw materials elsewhere. The colonizing country would convert the materials into manufactured wares, which it would sell back to the colonies. High tariffs and other barriers were implemented to ensure that colonies only purchased manufactured goods from their home countries. 


  New Economic Theories  

The Scottish economist Adam Smith was one of the first to question the wisdom of this arrangement. His Wealth of Nations was published in 1776, the same year Britain's American colonies declared independence in response to high taxes and restrictive trade arrangements.



Later writers, such as David Ricardo, further developed Smith's ideas, leading to the theory of comparative advantage. It maintains that if one country is better at producing a specific product while another country is better at producing another, each should devote its resources to the activity at which it excels. The countries should trade with one another rather than erect barriers that force them to divert resources toward activities they do not perform well. According to this theory, tariffs drag economic growth, even if they can be deployed to benefit specific narrow sectors under some circumstances.






These two approaches—free trade based on the idea of comparative advantage, on the one hand, and restricted trade based on the idea of a zero-sum game, on the other—have experienced ebbs and flows in popularity.


  Late 19th and Early 20th Centuries  

Relatively free trade enjoyed a heyday in the late 19th and early 20th centuries when the idea took hold that international commerce had made large-scale wars between nations so expensive and counterproductive that they were obsolete. World War I proved that idea wrong, and nationalist approaches to trade, including high tariffs, dominated until the end of World War II.



From that point on, free trade enjoyed a 50-year resurgence, culminating in the creation in 1995 of the World Trade Organization (WTO), which acts as an international forum for settling disputes and laying down ground rules. Free trade agreements, such as the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA)—now known as the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA)—and the European Union (EU), also proliferated.


  The 2010s  

Skepticism of this model—sometimes labeled neoliberalism by critics who tie it to 19th-century liberal arguments in favor of free trade—grew, however, and Britain in 2016 voted to leave the European Union. That same year Donald Trump won the U.S. presidential election on a platform that included a call for tariffs on Chinese and Mexican imports, which he implemented when he took office.



Critics of tariff-free multilateral trade deals, who come from both ends of the political spectrum, argue that they erode national sovereignty and encourage a race to the bottom regarding wages, worker protections, and product quality and standards. Meanwhile, the defenders of such deals counter that tariffs lead to trade wars, hurt consumers, and hamper innovation.




What Is the Simple Definition of a Tariff?
A tariff is an extra fee charged on an item by a country that imports that item.




What Is a Tariff Example?
One of the best-known tariff examples in the U.S. is the tea tax implemented by the British on the American colonies that led to the Boston Tea Party.




How Does a Tariff Work?
As an additional charge on an import, a tariff works to reroute a buyer's intentions and money away from the country exporting the good.


   The Bottom Line  

Tariffs have existed in one form or another for centuries. Trading partners implement them to politically influence a partner, protect domestic industries and consumers, and further national goals and interests.



Tariffs are not always negative, regardless of what you might see on the news. They can be a means to open negotiations again between trading partners, provide each a chance to voice concerns, and even help to stablize a country's market.
What Is Tax Accounting?  

Tax accounting is a structure of accounting methods focused on taxes rather than the appearance of public financial statements. In short, tax accounting is the means of accounting for tax purposes.



Tax accounting is governed by the Internal Revenue Code, which dictates the specific rules that companies and individuals must follow when preparing their tax returns. Tax accounting applies to everyone—individuals, businesses, corporations, and other entities. Even those who are exempt from paying taxes must participate in tax accounting. The purpose of tax accounting is to be able to track funds (funds coming in as well as funds going out) associated with individuals and entities.





Key Takeaways

Tax accounting is the subsector of accounting that deals with the preparations of tax returns and tax payments.Tax accounting is used by individuals, businesses, corporations and other entities.Tax accounting for an individual focuses on income, qualifying deductions, donations, and any investment gains or losses.For a business, tax accounting is more complex, with greater scrutiny regarding how funds are spent and what is or isn't taxable.


   Tax Accounting Principles vs. Financial Accounting (GAAP)  

In the United States, there are two sets of principles that are used when it comes to accounting. The first is tax accounting principles and the second is financial accounting, or generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).



Under GAAP, companies must follow a common set of accounting principles, standards, and procedures when they compile their financial statements by accounting for any and all financial transactions. Balance sheet items can be accounted for differently when preparing financial statements and tax payables. For example, companies can prepare their financial statements implementing the first-in-first-out (FIFO) method to record their inventory for financial purposes, yet they can implement the last-in-first-out (LIFO) approach for tax purposes. The latter procedure reduces the current year's taxes payable.



While accounting encompasses all financial transactions to some degree, tax accounting focuses solely on those transactions that affect an entity's tax burden, and how those items relate to proper tax calculation and tax document preparation. Tax accounting is regulated by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to ensure that all associated tax laws are adhered to by tax accounting professionals and individual taxpayers. The IRS also requires the use of specific documents and forms to properly submit tax information as required by law.






Hiring a professional tax accountant is optional for an individual, but often necessary for a corporation, as business taxes are more complicated than personal taxes.


   Types of Tax Accounting  
  Tax Accounting for Individuals  

For an individual taxpayer, tax accounting focuses solely on items such as income, qualifying deductions, investment gains or losses, and other transactions that affect the individual’s tax burden. This limits the amount of information that is necessary for an individual to manage an annual tax return, and while a tax accountant can be used by an individual, it is not a legal requirement.



Meanwhile, general accounting would involve the tracking of all funds coming in and out of the persons' possession regardless of the purpose, including personal expenses that have no tax implications.


  Tax Accounting for Businesses  

From a business perspective, more information must be analyzed as part of the tax accounting process. While the company’s earnings, or incoming funds, must be tracked just as they are for the individual, there is an additional level of complexity regarding any outgoing funds directed towards certain business obligations. This can include funds directed towards specific business expenses as well as funds directed towards shareholders.



While it is also not required that a business use a tax accountant to perform these duties, it is fairly common in larger organizations due to the complexity of the records involved.






Even legally tax-exempt organizations use tax accounting as they are required to file annual returns.


  Tax Accounting for Tax-Exempt Organizations  

Even in instances where an organization is tax-exempt, tax accounting is necessary. This is due to the fact that most organizations must file annual returns. They must provide information regarding any incoming funds, such as grants or donations, as well as how the funds are used during the organization’s operation. This helps ensure that the organization adheres to all laws and regulations governing the proper operation of a tax-exempt entity.




What Is the Main Purpose of Tax Accounting?
Tax accounting is used by companies to help them make the proper tax calculations and prepare tax documents in time for filing season.




What Is the Difference Between a Tax Accountant and a Management Accountant?
A management accountant is an internal party who can not work with external clients, while a tax accountant is an external party who can work with other businesses and individuals. Management accountants assist their own companies with the financial implications of business decisions or provide strategic advice. Tax accountants help companies and individuals comply with taxation requirements.




How Can You Start a Career in Tax Accounting?
Tax accountants need a CPA licensure. This usually requires a bachelor's degree in an accounting-related field. Also and although it's not required by every company hiring tax accountants, CPA candidates should complete a master's program in accounting.Once the CPA licensure is obtained, tax accountants often require continuing education (CE) courses to maintain their credentials. The CE requirements and length vary by state.


   The Bottom Line  

Tax accounting is a set of methods for accounting and a useful tool that companies use to understand their tax liability and avoid penalties. Tax accounting is key not only for businesses but also for individuals to declare the correct income, pay appropriate taxes, and avoid penalties or IRS audits.
What Is Tax-Advantaged?  

The term tax-advantaged refers to any type of investment, financial account, or savings plan that is either exempt from taxation, tax-deferred, or that offers other types of tax benefits. Examples of tax-advantaged investments are municipal bonds, partnerships, UITs, and annuities. Tax-advantaged plans include IRAs and qualified retirement plans such as 401(k)s.





Key Takeaways

Tax-advantaged refers to favorable tax status held by certain qualified investments, accounts, or other financial vehicles.Investors of different financial situations can benefit from tax-advantaged investments and accounts.Common examples include municipal bonds, 401(k) or 403(b) accounts, 529 plans, and certain types of partnerships.Tax-deferred status means that pre-tax income is used to fund an investment where taxes will be paid at a later date and at tax rates at that time.Tax-exempt status uses after-tax money to fund investments where gains or income produced by them are not subject to ordinary income tax.


   Understanding Tax-Advantaged  

Tax-advantaged investments and accounts are used by a wide variety of investors and employees in various financial situations. High-income taxpayers seek tax-free municipal-bond income, while employees save for retirement with IRAs and employer-sponsored retirement plans.



The two common methods that allow people to minimize their tax bills are tax-deferred and tax-exempt status. The key to deciding which, or if a combination of both, makes sense for you comes down to when the tax advantages are realized.


  Tax-Deferred Accounts  

Tax-deferred accounts allow you to realize immediate tax deductions on the full amount of your contribution, but future withdrawals from the account will be taxed at your ordinary-income rate. The most common tax-deferred retirement accounts in the U.S. are traditional IRAs and 401(k) plans. In Canada, the most common is a Registered Retirement Savings Plan (RRSP).



Essentially, as the name of the account implies, taxes on income are deferred to a later date.



For example, if your taxable income this year is $50,000 and you contributed $3,000 to a tax-deferred account, you would pay tax on only $47,000. In 30 years, once you retire, if your taxable income is initially $40,000, but you decide to withdraw $4,000 from the account, taxable income would be bumped up to $44,000.






The SECURE Act makes alterations to many of the rules related to tax-advantaged retirement plans and savings vehicles, like traditional IRAs and 529 accounts.


  Tax-Exempt Accounts  

Tax-exempt accounts, on the other hand, provide future tax benefits because withdrawals at retirement are not subject to taxes. Since contributions to the account are made with after-tax dollars, there is no immediate tax advantage.



The primary advantage of this type of structure is that investment returns grow tax-free. Popular tax-exempt accounts in the U.S. are the Roth IRA and Roth 401(k). In Canada, the most common is a Tax-Free Savings Account (TFSA).



If you contributed $1,000 into a tax-exempt account today and the funds were invested in a mutual fund, which provided a yearly 3% return, in 30 years the account would be valued at $2,427. By contrast, in a regular taxable investment portfolio where one would pay capital gains taxes on $1,427, if this investment were made through a tax-exempt account, growth would not be taxed.



With a tax-deferred account, taxes are paid in the future but with a tax-exempt account, taxes are paid right now. However, by shifting the period when you pay taxes and realizing tax-free investment growth, major advantages can be realized.


   Tax-Advantaged Investments  

Tax-advantaged investments shelter some or all of an investor’s income from taxation, allowing them to minimize their tax burden. Municipal bond investors, for example, receive interest on their bonds for the duration of the bond’s life.



The proceeds from issuing these bonds to investors are used by municipal authorities to fund capital projects in the community. To incentivize more investors to purchase these bonds, the interest income received by investors is not taxed at the federal level. In many cases, if the bondholder resides in the same state where the bonds were issued, their interest income will also be exempt from state and local taxes.



Depreciation also yields tax advantages for individuals and businesses that invest in real estate. Depreciation is an income tax deduction that allows a taxpayer to recover the cost basis of certain property. In the U.S., the cost of acquiring a land or building is capitalized over a specified number of useful years by annual depreciation deductions.



For example, assume an investor purchases a property for $5 million (the cost basis). After five years, the investor has depreciation deductions of $500,000 and their new cost basis is $4.5 million. If they sell the property for $5.75 million, the investor's realized gain will be $5.75 million - $4.5 million = $1.25 million. The $500,000 deduction will be taxed at the depreciation recapture rate and the remaining $750,000 will be taxed as a capital gain. Without the tax advantage of the depreciation allowance, the entire gain realized from the sale of the property will be taxed as a capital gain.


   Tax-Advantaged Accounts  

With regular brokerage accounts, the IRS taxes investors on any capital gains realized from selling profitable investments. However, tax-advantaged accounts allow an individual’s investing activities to be tax-deferred and, in some cases, tax-free. Traditional individual retirement accounts (IRAs) and 401(k) plans are examples of tax-deferred accounts in which earnings on investments are not taxed every year.



Instead, tax is deferred until the individual retires, at which point s/he can start making withdrawals from the account. Withdrawing from these accounts without penalty is allowed once the account holder turns 59½ years old.



Prior to the passage of the Setting Every Community Up for Retirement Enhancement (SECURE) Act, which was signed into law on December 20, 2019, once an account holder turned 70½ years, they were obligated to begin taking required minimum distributions (RMDs) from their tax-deferred retirement accounts. Under SECURE, seniors have until age 72 before the required minimum distributions kick in. In addition, the age limit for contributing to a traditional IRA was removed, allowing working account holders to invest indefinitely, similar to a Roth IRA.



The threshold to begin receiving distributions was changed once again when Congress approved and passed the SECURE Act 2.0 in December 2022. Individuals must begin taking RMDs when they turn 73 on or after Jan. 1, 2023.






Taxpayers should be aware that special tax provisions enacted as part of the CARES Act, applied only for 2020.


   The Bottom Line  

Roth IRAs and FSAs offer even more tax savings for investors than tax-deferred accounts, as activities in these accounts are exempt from tax. Withdrawals and earnings in these accounts are tax-free, providing a perfect example of a tax advantage.



Governments establish tax advantages to encourage private individuals to contribute money when it is considered to be in the public interest. Selecting the proper type of tax-advantaged accounts or investments depends on an investor's financial situation.
What Is Tax Avoidance?  

The term tax avoidance refers to the use of legal methods to minimize the amount of income tax owed by an individual or a business. This is generally accomplished by claiming as many deductions and credits as are allowable. It may also be achieved by prioritizing investments that have tax advantages, such as buying tax-free municipal bonds. Tax avoidance is not the same as tax evasion, which relies on illegal methods such as underreporting income and falsifying deductions.





Key Takeaways

Tax avoidance is any legal method used by a taxpayer to minimize the amount of income tax owed.Individual taxpayers and corporations can use forms of tax avoidance to lower their tax bills.Tax credits, deductions, income exclusion, and loopholes are forms of tax avoidance.These are legal tax breaks offered to encourage certain behaviors, such as saving for retirement or buying a home.Tax avoidance is unlike tax evasion, which relies on illegal methods such as underreporting income.


   Understanding Tax Avoidance  

Tax avoidance is a legal strategy that many taxpayers can use to avoid paying taxes or at least lower their tax bills. In fact, millions of individuals and businesses use some form of tax avoidance to cut down how much they owe to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) legally and legitimately. When used in this context, tax avoidance is also referred to as a tax shelter.



Taxpayers can take advantage of tax avoidance through various credits, deductions, exclusions, and loopholes, such as:



Claiming the child tax credit
Investing in a retirement account and maxing out your annual contributions
Taking the mortgage tax deduction
Putting money into a health savings account (HSA)



Credits and deductions (and, therefore, tax avoidance) must first be approved by U.S. Congress and signed into law by the president before it becomes part of the U.S. Tax Code. Once done, these provisions can be used for the benefit or relief of some or all taxpayers.



Tax avoidance is built into the Internal Revenue Code (IRC). Lawmakers use the Tax Code to manipulate citizen behavior by offering tax credits, deductions, or exemptions. By doing so, they indirectly subsidize certain essential services such as health insurance, retirement saving, and higher education. Or, they may use the Tax Code to advance national goals, such as greater energy efficiency.


   Special Considerations  

The expanding use of tax avoidance in the U.S. Tax Code has made it one of the most complex tax codes in the world. In fact, its sheer complexity causes many taxpayers to miss out on certain tax breaks. Taxpayers end up spending billions of hours each year filing tax returns, with much of that time used looking for ways to avoid paying higher taxes.



Families often have a difficult time making decisions about retirement, savings, and education because the tax code changes every year. Businesses especially suffer the consequences of a tax code that constantly evolves, which can affect hiring decisions and growth strategies.



Eliminating or reducing tax avoidance is at the core of most proposals seeking to change the Tax Code. Newer proposals often seek to simplify the process by flattening tax rates and removing most tax avoidance provisions. Proponents of establishing a flat tax rate argue that it would eliminate the need to pursue tax avoidance strategies. Opponents, however, call the flat tax concept regressive.



There are some tax policies, though, that disproportionately advantage citizens with higher incomes. For instance:



Federal estate taxes are abolished on estates valued at less than $12.92 million in 2023
Capital gains are taxed at a lower rate than most earned income
Mortgage interest is deductible on both a first home and a second (but not a third) home






Make sure you save every receipt that may be useful for legal tax avoidance if you're a business owner, freelancer, or investor.


   Types of Tax Avoidance  

As noted above, there are several ways that taxpaying entities can avoid paying taxes. This includes certain credits and deductions, exclusions, and loopholes that make up the U.S. Tax Code. The following are just a few of the tools taxpayers have at their disposal to take advantage of tax avoidance.


  The Standard Deduction  

The Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center estimates that about 90% of households will use the standard deduction rather than itemizing their deductions. The standard deduction is $13,850 for single filers and $27,700 for married couples filing jointly in 2023.



For most Americans, that negates the usefulness even of the mortgage interest deduction—especially now that the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), which was signed in 2017, increased the standard deduction capped deductions for state and local taxes at $10,000.



But there are plenty of small business owners, freelancers, investors, and others who save every business expense receipt that may be eligible for a deduction. Others leap to the IRS challenge and angle for every tax deduction and credit they can get.


  Retirement Savings  

Saving money for your retirement means you're probably engaging in tax avoidance. And that's a good thing. Every individual who contributes to an employer-sponsored retirement plan or invests in an individual retirement account (IRA) is engaging in tax avoidance.



If the account is a so-called traditional plan, the investor gets an immediate tax break equalling the amount they contribute each year, up to a limit that is revised annually. Income taxes on the money is owed when it is withdrawn after the saver retires. The retiree's taxable income will probably be lower as well as the taxes owed. That's tax avoidance.



Roth plans allow investors to save after-tax money and the tax break will come after retirement, in the form of tax-free savings. In this case, the entire balance of the account is tax-free. Roths allow the saver to permanently avoid income taxes on the money their contributions earn over the year.


  Workplace Expenses  

You can use deductions through your workplace to avoid taxes. You may be able to claim certain expenses that are not reimbursed through your employer on your annual tax return. These costs are considered necessary in order to do your job. Workplace expenses include mileage on a personal vehicle, union dues, or tools you may need.


  Offshoring  

There are loopholes in the U.S. Tax Code that allow corporations and high-net-worth individuals (HNWIs) to move their money to offshore tax havens. These are locations that have looser regulations, more favorable tax laws, lower financial risks, and confidentiality. Going offshore by setting up subsidiaries or bank accounts allows these taxpaying entities to avoid paying (higher) taxes in their home countries.


   Tax Avoidance vs. Tax Evasion  

People often confuse tax avoidance with tax evasion. While both are ways to avoid having to pay taxes, they are very different. Tax avoidance is very legal while tax evasion is completely illegal.



Tax evasion happens when people underreport or fail to report income or revenue earned to a taxing authority like the IRS. You are guilty of tax evasion if you don't report all of your income, such as tips or bonuses paid by your employer. Claiming credits to which you aren't entitled is also considered tax evasion. Some taxpayers are guilty of tax evasion by not filing their taxes or not paying their taxes even if they've filed returns.



Tax evasion is a serious offense. Entities that are found liable can be fined, jailed, or both.




Is Tax Avoidance Legal?
The simple answer to this question is yes. Tax avoidance can be a legal way to avoid paying taxes. For instance, you can avoid paying taxes by using tax credits, deductions, exclusions, and loopholes to your advantage. For instance, corporations often use different legal strategies to avoid paying taxes. These include offshoring their profits, using accelerated depreciation, and taking deductions for employee stock options.Tax avoidance can be illegal, though, when taxpayers make it a point to ignore tax laws as they apply to them deliberately. Doing so can result in fines, penalties, levies, and even legal action.




What's the Difference Between Tax Avoidance and Tax Evasion?
Tax avoidance is generally a legal way that taxpayers can avoid paying taxes. They can do so by using tax credits, deductions, exclusions, and loopholes that are part of the tax code to their advantage. Using these strategies can help them either avoid paying taxes altogether or lower their tax liability. Tax avoidance can be illegal if a taxpayer abuses these strategies and doesn't follow tax laws.Tax evasion, on the other hand, is the deliberate failure to comply with tax laws. By doing this, taxpayers evade tax assessment and payment of their taxes. Tax evasion can entail hiding income, offshoring income in areas that don't comply with a taxpayer's home country, falsifying tax records, and inflating expenses. Tax evasion can result in fines, penalties, levies, and even prosecution.




What Are the Types of Tax Avoidance?
There are many strategies that taxpayers can use to avoid paying taxes. These are very legal and legitimate options. They include taking the standard deduction, contributing to a qualified retirement account, claiming work-related expenses, and offshoring profits.


   The Bottom Line  

Contrary to what most people think, tax avoidance is a very legal way to avoid paying too much in taxes. There are different strategies in place that you can use to completely avoid paying or lower your tax liability. For instance, you can use the standard deduction to avoid paying excess taxes on your annual income. And if you save for retirement in an IRA, the amount is also considered a tax avoidance strategy. But don't confuse it with tax evasion. which is illegal. When in doubt, consult a tax or financial professional about how to ensure that.you're following the law.
What Is a Tax Base?  

A tax base is the total value of all of the assets, income, and economic activity that can be taxed by a taxing authority, usually a government. It is used to calculate tax liabilities.



Tax liabilities come in many forms, including income, property, capital gains, and sales taxes.





Key Takeaways

Individual income taxes are the main source of revenue for the U.S. government.Additional revenue comes from business and corporate taxes, excise taxes, customs duties, and even fees paid for entrance to national parks.All of those sources combined add up to the tax base of the United States.In 2022, the federal government collected $4.90 trillion from its tax base. 


   Understanding the Tax Base  

A tax base is the total value of all assets, properties, individual income, and corporate income in a certain area or jurisdiction. 



To calculate the total tax liability, you must multiply the tax base by the tax rate: 



Tax Liability = Tax Base x Tax Rate



The rate of tax imposed varies depending on the type of tax and the tax base total. Income tax, gift tax, and estate tax are each calculated using a different tax rate schedule.


   Income As a Tax Base  

Let's take personal or corporate income as an example. In this case, the tax base is the minimum amount of yearly income that can be taxed. This is taxable income. Income tax is assessed on both personal income and the net income generated by businesses. 



For example, using the formula above, we can calculate a person's tax liability. Say Margaret earned $10,000 last year and the minimum amount of income that was subject to tax was $5,000 at a tax rate of 10%. Her total tax liability would be $500—calculated using her tax base multiplied by her tax rate:



$5,000 x 10% = $500



In real life, you would use federal Form 1040 for personal income. The return starts with total income and then deductions and other expenses are subtracted to arrive at adjusted gross income (AGI). Itemized deductions and expenses reduce AGI to calculate the tax base, and the personal tax rates are based on the total taxable income.



An individual taxpayer’s tax base can change as a result of the alternative minimum tax (AMT) calculation. Under AMT, the taxpayer is required to make adjustments to the initial tax calculation so additional items are added to the return. The tax base and the related tax liability both increase.



As an example, interest on some tax-exempt municipal bonds is added to the AMT calculation as taxable bond income. If AMT generates a higher tax liability than the initial calculation, the taxpayer pays the higher amount.


   Factoring in Capital Gains  

Taxpayers are taxed on realized gains when assets such as real property or stock investments are sold. If an investor owns an asset and does not sell it, that investor has an unrealized capital gain, and there is no taxable event.



Assume, for example, an investor holds a stock for five years and sells the shares for a $20,000 gain. Since the stock was held for more than one year, the gain is considered long term and any capital losses reduce the tax base of the gain. After deducting losses, the tax base of the capital gain is multiplied by capital gain tax rates.


   Examples of Tax Jurisdictions  

In addition to paying federal taxes, taxpayers are assessed taxes at the state and local levels in several forms.



Most investors are assessed income tax at the state level, and homeowners pay property tax at the local level. The tax base for owning property is the home or building's assessed valuation.



All but five states also assess sales tax, which is imposed on most purchases. The tax base for sales tax in this case is the retail price of goods purchased by the consumer.




What Are the 3 Tax Bases?
The Internal Revenue Service defines these 3 tax bases:A progressive tax takes a larger percentage of income from high-income groups than from low-income groups.A proportional tax takes the same percentage of income from all income groups.A regressive tax takes a larger percentage of income from low-income groups than from high-income groups.By these definitions, the U.S. has a progressive federal income tax system. Its Social Security tax and property tax systems are regressive.Sales taxes are also regressive, since everyone pays the same percentage of tax for purchases, regardless of income.




What Does It Mean to 'Broaden the Tax Base?'
When a government seeks to "broaden the tax base," it usually means increasing tax revenues by expanding the type or level of income or assets that are subject to taxation, rather than raising the tax rates overall. For example, the federal government might repeal the favorable treatment of long-term capital gains, or eliminate the deduction for interest on student loans. The tax base is broadened, but the tax rates remain the same.




What Is a 'Broad' or 'Narrow' Tax Base?
A tax base may be broad or narrow depending on the number of people within a tax jurisdiction who are subject to a tax. A luxury tax, for example, may be levied only on those who buy yachts or high-end cars.Most state sales taxes are narrow base. They omit necessities like food and medicine in order to avoid over-taxing the poorest residents, who pay a disproportionately high sales tax on other goods as a percentage of income.


   The Bottom Line  

A single individual may have assets or participate in activities in several distinct tax bases. For example, all workers pay income taxes, placing them within the tax base of the United States. Homeowners land in the local tax base as well, and are subject to property taxes. A person who smokes or drinks may be in a narrower tax base of people who pay a "sin tax" on top of regular state sales taxes.
What Is a Tax Benefit?  

The term tax benefit refers to any tax law that helps you reduce your tax liability. Benefits range from deductions and tax credits to exclusions and exemptions. They cover various areas, including programs for families, education, employees, and natural disasters.



Some tax benefits are related to the ability to pay taxes. For example, the child tax credit and the earned income tax credit (EITC) recognize the cost of raising a family. Other tax benefits, including mortgage interest and charitable donation deductions, are incentives designed to further social policy goals.





Key Takeaways

Tax benefits create savings for individual and business taxpayers.Common tax benefits include deductions, credits, exclusions, and shelters.You can take standard or itemized deductions plus any available above-the-line deductions.To qualify for tax benefits, you must meet specific requirements, such as income limits, filing status, and dependent status.Be sure to stay abreast of any tax benefits you may be eligible for so you don't miss out on tax savings.


   Understanding Tax Benefits  

Tax benefits help individuals and corporations reduce their overall tax bills. These benefits are a significant part of the tax regulations and legislation set by local, state, and federal governments.



Tax benefits like deductions, credits, exemptions, and exclusions reduce the amount you owe annually to federal and state governments. On the other hand, tax shelters help lower taxes through particular investments. These are legal vehicles that provide favorable tax treatment. Common examples of tax shelters include municipal bonds and employer-sponsored 401(k) plans.



You must be eligible for tax benefits to claim them. For instance, to qualify for head of household status, you must be unmarried, have a qualifying dependent who lives with you, and pay more than half of the household expenses for the year. And tax benefits for educational expenses can only be claimed by those who spend money on tuition and other related costs during the tax year.



It makes financial sense to learn about any tax benefits you might be eligible for. Without the proper knowledge, you could end up paying more in taxes than you owe. It can be helpful to consult a tax professional, such as an accountant, to maximize your tax savings.


   Types of Tax Benefits  

As noted above, tax benefits come in all shapes and sizes. We've highlighted some of the more common ones below.


  Tax Deductions  

A tax deduction reduces your taxable income. When you file your annual income tax return, you have the option to take the standard deduction or itemize your deductions:



Standard Deduction: The standard deduction is a fixed dollar amount that reduces taxable income. For 2022, the standard deduction is $12,950 for single filers and married taxpayers filing separately, $19,400 for heads of household, and $25,900 for married couples filing jointly and surviving spouses. For 2023, these figures increase to $13,850, $20,800, and $27,700, respectively.
Itemized Deductions: Itemized deductions are qualified expenses allowed by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to decrease your taxable income by listing them on Schedule A of your tax return. The sum of your itemized deductions reduces your adjusted gross income (AGI). There is no limit on itemized deductions for tax years between 2018 to 2023 due to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.



Itemizing your deductions makes sense if the sum of your qualified expenses is greater than your standard deduction. For example, if a single taxpayer's itemized expenses total $13,000, they would likely itemize rather than take the $12,550 standard deduction. However, if the same filer's qualified expenses total just $8,000, they would save money by taking the standard deduction.



Even if you don't itemize, you can take certain above-the-line deductions with the standard deduction. These include student loan interest, traditional individual retirement account (IRA) contributions, contributions to health savings accounts, and more. All these deductions lower taxes by reducing taxable income and possibly lowering your tax bracket.



Say, for example, a single filer has $42,000 of taxable income for the 2022 tax year, landing them in the 22% marginal tax bracket. Therefore, they pay 22% on any income over $40,525 (the beginning of the 22% tax bracket). However, if they qualify for $2,000 in above-the-line tax deductions, they will be taxed on $42,000 - $2,000 = $40,000, giving them a marginal tax rate of 12%.






Tax deductions often reduce the total amount of income earned for businesses. Most companies use a standard income statement to calculate their taxable obligations, with taxation falling on the last line.


  Tax Credits  

Tax credits also save you money, but they work differently than deductions. A tax credit is applied to the amount of tax you owe after all tax calculations are made. For example, if you owe $3,000 after taking deductions and calculating taxes with your marginal tax rate, a $1,000 credit would reduce your tax bill to $2,000.



There are many types of tax credits available for individuals and businesses. For individuals, some of the most common tax credits include the child tax credit, the EITC, and the premium tax credit.



Tax credits are either refundable or non-refundable. A refundable tax credit results in a refund check if the tax credit exceeds your tax bill. For example, say you apply a $3,400 tax credit to your $3,000 tax bill. Your bill would be reduced to zero, and you would receive the remaining portion of the credit as a refund. In this case, it would be $400.



A non-refundable tax credit does not result in a refund because it only reduces the tax owed to zero. Using the example above, if the $3,400 tax credit were non-refundable, you would owe nothing to the government but would forfeit the $400 that remains after the credit is applied. Some examples of non-refundable tax credits include the saver’s credit, adoption credit, child care credit, and mortgage interest tax credits.






Tax credits do not impact your taxable income or marginal tax bracket. They are subtracted from your tax bill to directly reduce the amount of tax you owe.


  Exemptions and Exclusions  

The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) suspended the personal tax exemption for 2018 through 2025, but some tax exclusions still apply. Tax exclusions usually arise in pretax payments that help you lower your taxable bottom line. Income excluded for tax purposes usually does not show up on your tax return at all.



One of the most common exclusions is the employer-based health insurance payment program. If an employer takes healthcare payments on a pretax basis, an employee’s taxable income is lowered at the end of the pay period, which reduces the amount of tax owed.






The annual gift tax exclusion is $16,000 for 2022 and increases to $17,000 for 2023. You can gift up to that amount tax-free to as many people as you wish without using up any of your lifetime gift and estate tax exemption.


  Tax Shelters  

A tax shelter provides a variety of tax advantages. It is generally a vehicle with lower or no tax requirements if you abide by the contracted terms. One of the most popular tax shelters is the 401(k). That's because investors are sheltered from paying a higher tax rate during their higher-earning years than they are likely to pay in retirement when their income (and tax rate) is lower.



Tax havens can also be a type of tax shelter. These are often used by businesses. Companies may incorporate in certain regions to lower their business tax bill. Some of the most popular tax havens include Bermuda, the Bahamas, and the Cayman Islands.






Not all tax shelters are legal and legitimate. The IRS treats illegal tax shelters as fraudulent activities. Taxpayers who use illegal tax schemes may face penalties, criminal prosecution, and prison time.



Certain investment products may offer a tax shelter or tax exemption in and of themselves. Municipal bonds, for example, are exempt from federal and state taxes if aligned with the state in which the bondholder lives. Other tax-advantaged investments include tax-free savings accounts, municipal mutual funds or exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and some life insurance policies.




What Is the Difference Between a Tax Credit and a Tax Deduction?
Tax credits and tax deductions both reduce the amount of tax you owe, but they work in different ways. Tax credits directly lower the amount of tax you owe, while tax deductions decrease your taxable income.Say you're eligible for a $1,000 tax credit and a $1,000 tax deduction. The tax credit reduces your tax bill by that same $1,000. So, if you owed $1,500 in taxes and then took a $1,000 credit, your tax bill would be $500 ($1,500 - $1,000). On the other hand, the tax deduction reduces your taxable income by $1,000. So, if you fall into the 22% tax bracket, the $1,000 deduction would save you $220 ($1,000 × 22%). Tax credits are more favorable because they save you more money than tax deductions.




What Is the Estate Tax Exemption for 2022?
The estate tax is the amount below which a decedent's estate is not subject to taxes. For 2022, the exemption is $12.06 million. For 2023, it increases to $12.920 million.




How Much Is the Earned Income Tax Credit for 2022?
The earned income tax credit is a refundable tax credit for low- and moderate-income households. If you're eligible for the EITC, the amount you receive depends on your filing status, income, and the number of dependents you can claim. For 2022, the maximum earned income tax credit is $560 if you have no dependents, $3,733 for one dependent, $6,164 for two dependents, and $6,935 for three or more dependents. These amounts increase to $600, $3,995, $6,604, and $7,430, respectively, for 2023.


   The Bottom Line  

It's important to know where you stand with respect to your tax bill even if it isn't tax season. Keeping on top of the tax benefits that apply to you can spell the difference between a refund and a huge tax bill—or at least breaking even when it comes time to file. These benefits range from tax credits and deductions to exclusions and exemptions. Be sure to speak to a tax professional if you're unsure about how they may work for you.
What Is a Tax Bracket?  

A tax bracket refers to a range of incomes subject to a certain income tax rate. Tax brackets are part of a progressive tax system, in which the level of tax rates progressively increases as an individual’s income grows. Low incomes fall into tax brackets with relatively low income tax rates, while higher earnings fall into brackets with higher rates.



For tax years 2022 and 2023, there are seven federal tax brackets, with rates ranging from 10% to 37%. Read on to learn the details.





Key Takeaways

There are currently seven federal tax brackets in the United States, with rates ranging from 10% to 37%.The U.S. tax system is progressive, with people in lower brackets taxed at lower rates and those in higher brackets taxed at higher ones.Unless your total income fits in just the lowest tax bracket, you are charged at multiple rates, according to the additional brackets into which your income flows.You are not simply taxed at the rate of the bracket into which your total income falls; therefore, you effectively pay less than that rate.Typically, the IRS adjusts tax brackets for inflation every year.


   Understanding Tax Brackets  

The United States uses a progressive tax system, meaning that it uses a marginal tax rate to determine taxes owed. A marginal tax rate determines the tax paid on an additional dollar of income that takes a taxpayer into a higher tax bracket.



The marginal tax rate increases as a taxpayer’s income increases. There are different tax rates for various levels of income. In other words, taxpayers will pay the lowest tax rate on the first “bracket” or level of taxable income, a higher rate on the next level, and so on.



The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) announces any changes to tax brackets and rates annually. For tax years 2022 and 2023, there are seven federal tax brackets. Each is assigned a different rate, ranging from 10% to 37%, and range of taxable income per bracket. The dollar ranges in each bracket vary for single filers, married joint filers (and qualifying widow[er]s), married filing separately filers, and head of household filers.



When determining which tax bracket to use, a taxpayer should first calculate their taxable income, including earned and investment income minus adjustments and deductions.


   Tax Rates vs. Tax Brackets  

Tax brackets and tax rates are both used to calculate the total taxes owed. However, while they might sound similar, they are, in fact, distinctly different from each other.



A tax rate is a percentage at which income is taxed, while each tax bracket is a range of income with a different tax rate. These rates are 10%, 12%, or 22% and higher, and are referred to as the marginal rate.



Most taxpayers—all except those who fall squarely into only the minimum bracket—have income that is taxed progressively. This means that their income is subject to multiple rates beyond the nominal rate of their tax bracket.



For example, an annual income of $100,000 fits the 24% tax bracket for tax years 2022 and 2023. However, the entire $100,000 isn't taxed at 24%. It's taxed at the different rates aligned with the various brackets of income that cover the segments of income up to $100,000. So, ultimately a taxpayer pays less than they would if the total income were taxed at 24%.



Thus, a taxpayer’s tax bracket does not necessarily reflect the percentage of their income that they will pay in taxes. The term for this is the effective tax rate.






Tax brackets are adjusted each year for inflation, using the Consumer Price Index (CPI).

   Example of Tax Brackets  

Below is an example of marginal tax rates for a single filer based on 2022 tax rates.



Single filers with less than $10,275 in taxable income are subject to a 10% income tax rate (the lowest bracket).Single filers who earn more than $10,275 will have the first $10,275 taxed at 10%, but earnings beyond the first bracket and up to $41,775 will be taxed at a 12% rate (the next bracket).Earnings from $41,776 to $89,075 are taxed at 22%, the third bracket.



Consider the following tax responsibility for a single filer with a taxable income of $50,000 in 2022:



The first $10,275 is taxed at 10%: $10,275 × 0.10 = $1,027.50Then $10,276 to $41,775, or $31,499, is taxed at 12%: $31,499 × 0.12 = $3,779.88Finally, the remaining $8,225 (what’s left of the $50,000 income) is taxed at 22%: $8,225 × 0.22 = $1,809.50



Add the taxes owed in each of the brackets:



Total taxes: $1,027.50 + $3,779.88 + $1,809.50 = $6,616.88



The individual’s effective tax rate is approximately 13% of income:



Divide total taxes by annual earnings: $6,616.88 ÷ $50,000 = 0.13Multiply 0.13 by 100 to convert to a percentage, which is 13%.






Taxes that you pay on 401(k) withdrawals are also based on tax brackets.


   Pros and Cons of Tax Brackets  

Tax brackets—and the progressive tax system that they create—contrast with a flat tax structure, in which all individuals are taxed at the same rate, regardless of their income levels.





Pros

Higher-income individuals are more able to pay income taxes and keep a good living standard.
Low-income individuals pay less, leaving them more to support themselves.
Tax deductions and credits give high-income individuals tax relief, while rewarding useful behavior, such as donating to charity.



Cons

Wealthy people end up paying a disproportionate amount of taxes.
Brackets make the wealthy focus on finding tax loopholes that result in many underpaying their taxes, depriving the government of revenue.
Progressive taxation leads to reduced personal savings.





  Positives  

Proponents of tax brackets and progressive tax systems contend that individuals with high incomes are better able to pay income taxes while maintaining a relatively high standard of living. In contrast, low-income individuals who struggle to meet their basic needs should be subject to less taxation.



Proponents stress that it is only fair that wealthy taxpayers pay more in taxes than the poor and the middle class, offsetting the inequality of income distribution. That makes the progressive taxation system progressive in both senses of the word: It rises in stages, and it is designed with help for lower-income taxpayers in mind.



Supporters maintain that this system can generate higher revenues for governments and still be fair by letting taxpayers lower their tax bill through adjustments, such as tax deductions or tax credits for outlays such as charitable contributions.



The higher income that taxpayers realize can then be funneled back into the economy. Furthermore, tax brackets have an automatic stabilizing effect on an individual’s after-tax income, as a decrease in funds is counteracted by a decrease in the tax rate, leaving the individual with a less substantial decrease.


  Negatives  

Opponents of tax brackets and progressive tax schedules argue that everyone is equal under the law regardless of income or economic status and that there should be no discrimination between rich and poor.



They also point out that progressive taxation can lead to a substantial discrepancy between the amount of tax that wealthy people pay and the amount of government representation that they receive. Some even point out that citizens get only one vote per person regardless of the personal or even national percentage of tax that they pay.



Opponents also claim that higher taxation at higher income levels leads some wealthier individuals to exploit tax law loopholes to find creative ways to shelter earnings and assets. They can actually end up paying less in taxes than the less well-off, depriving the government of revenue. For example, some American companies have relocated their headquarters abroad to avoid or reduce their U.S. corporate taxes.


   History of Federal Tax Brackets  

Tax brackets have existed in the U.S. tax code since the inception of the very first income tax, when the Union government passed the Revenue Act of 1861 to help fund its war against the Confederacy. A second revenue act in 1862 established the first two tax brackets: 3% for annual incomes from $600 to $10,000, and 5% on incomes above $10,000. The original four filing statuses were single, married filing jointly, married filing separately, and head of household, though rates were the same regardless of tax status.



In 1872, Congress rescinded the income tax. It didn’t reappear until the ratification of the 16th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution in 1913 established Congress’ right to levy a federal income tax. That same year, Congress enacted a 1% income tax for individuals earning more than $3,000 a year and couples earning more than $4,000, with a graduated surtax of 1% to 7% on incomes from $20,000 and up.



Over the years, the number of tax brackets has fluctuated. When the federal income tax began in 1913, there were seven tax brackets. In 1918, the number mushroomed to 56 brackets, ranging from 6% to 77%. In 1944, the top rate hit 91%. But it was brought back down to 70% in 1964 by then-President Lyndon B. Johnson. In 1981, then-President Ronald Reagan initially brought the top rate down to 50%.



Then, in the Tax Reform Act of 1986, brackets were simplified, and the rates were reduced so that, in 1988, there were only two brackets: 15% and 28%. This system lasted only until 1991, when the third bracket of 31% was added. Since then, additional brackets have been implemented, and we have come full circle and are back to seven brackets.


   State Tax Brackets  

Some states have no income tax: Alaska, Florida, Nevada, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Washington, and Wyoming. New Hampshire doesn’t tax earned wages, but it does tax investment income and interest. However, it is set to phase out those taxes starting in 2023, bringing the number of states with no income tax to nine by 2027.



In 2022, nine states had a flat rate structure, with a single rate applying to a resident’s income: Colorado (4.55%), Illinois (4.95%), Indiana (3.23%), Kentucky (5.0%), Massachusetts (5.0%), Michigan (4.25%), North Carolina (5.25%), Pennsylvania (3.07%), and Utah (4.95%).



In other states, the number of tax brackets varies from three to as many as nine (in California, Iowa, and Missouri) and even 12 (in Hawaii). The marginal tax rates in these brackets also vary considerably. California has the highest, maxing out at 12.3%.



State income tax regulations may or may not mirror federal rules. For example, some states allow residents to use the federal personal exemption and standard deduction amounts for figuring state income tax. In contrast, others have their own exemption and standard deduction amounts.


   How to Find Your Own Tax Bracket  

There are numerous online sources to find your specific federal income tax bracket. The IRS makes available a variety of information, including annual tax tables that provide highly detailed tax filing statuses in increments of $50 of taxable income up to $100,000.



Other websites provide tax bracket calculators that do the math for you, as long as you know your filing status and taxable income. Your tax bracket can shift from year to year, depending on inflation adjustments and changes in your income and status, so it’s worth checking on an annual basis.




What Are the Federal Tax Brackets for 2022?
The top tax rate is 37% for individual single taxpayers with incomes greater than $539,900 (or more than $647,850 for married couples filing jointly). The other rates are:35%, for incomes over $215,950 ($431,900 for married couples filing jointly)32% for incomes over $170,050 ($340,100 for married couples filing jointly)24% for incomes over $89,075 ($178,150 for married couples filing jointly)22% for incomes over $41,775 ($83,550 for married couples filing jointly)12% for incomes over $10,275 ($20,550 for married couples filing jointly)The lowest rate for the 2022 tax year is 10% for single individuals with incomes of $10,275 or less ($20,550 for married couples filing jointly).




How Much Can I Earn Before I Pay 40% Tax?
Currently, there is no 40% tax bracket. For 2022, the highest earners in the United States pay a top rate of 37% federal tax on all income made beyond $539,900 (single filers) and $647,850 (married couples filing jointly).




How Do I Calculate My Tax Bracket?
To estimate which tax brackets your earnings will fall under, you could do the math yourself by using the tables shown above or by visiting the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) website, which provides highly detailed tax filing statuses in increments of $50 of taxable income up to $100,000.


   The Bottom Line  

The federal tax system in the U.S. is progressive. Taxpayers who fall into lower brackets pay lower rates than taxpayers in higher brackets. In 2022 and 2023, there are seven federal tax brackets, with rates ranging from 10% to 37%.



Unless your taxable income lands you in the lowest tax bracket, you are charged at multiple rates as your income rises. Your entire income is not subject to the rate of the bracket classified for your total income level.
What Is a Tax Break?  

The term tax break refers to a benefit the government offers that reduces your total tax liability. Tax breaks are made possible by tax laws and typically come in the form of credits and deductions. Other tax breaks include exemptions and excluding certain types of income from your state or federal tax return.



Tax breaks also refer to the favorable tax treatment certain groups receive. Churches and religious organizations, for example, are generally exempt from federal, state, and local income and property taxes, among other tax perks. Likewise, people affected by natural disasters receive tax breaks in the form of filing and payment extensions, penalty and interest waivers, and deductions for casualty and theft losses.





Key Takeaways

Tax breaks such as credits and deductions lower your total tax liability.Tax breaks are the product of tax laws designed to strengthen the economy or promote specific policy goals.Tax breaks are also specifically designed to promote specific economic activity (i.e. there are tax incentives for getting a secondary education).A tax credit offsets your tax liability on a dollar-for-dollar basis, and some refundable tax credits may reduce your liability below $0 and into a refund. A tax deduction reduces the amount of gross income that is subject to taxes.


   How Tax Breaks Work  

The government provides tax breaks to individual and corporate taxpayers, greatly reducing their tax liabilities. Tax credits, deductions, exemptions, and tax exclusions may enable these savings.



In some cases, you don't have to take any action to get a tax break. For example, life insurance proceeds you receive are generally excluded from your taxable income—and you don't have to report them. However, to take advantage of most tax breaks, you must claim them (e.g., tax credits or deductions) on your income tax return and meet specific eligibility requirements.






The personal exemption was a federal tax break up until 2017. Under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the personal exemption deduction is suspended (reduced to $0) for tax years 2018 through 2025.



Tax breaks can stimulate the economy by increasing the amount taxpayers have to spend and boosting what businesses can invest in their growth. Moreover, tax breaks can promote certain behaviors that benefit society, such as replacing gas-guzzling cars with modern fuel-efficient vehicles.



As noted above, tax breaks are implemented because of state and federal tax laws. Regulations outline how tax breaks work, who qualifies, and (in some cases) how long the tax break lasts. The U.S. Congress and the president are responsible for approving federal income tax laws. For instance, Congress approved the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), which made significant changes to the U.S. tax code and was signed into law in 2017 by then-President Donald Trump.






Charitable organizations and religious institutions are generally tax exempt. This means they are not required to pay federal income taxes.


   Types of Tax Breaks  
  Tax Credits  

A tax credit reduces your tax liability on a dollar-for-dollar basis. This has a greater impact than a deduction, which merely reduces the amount of income subject to taxes. A tax credit is applied to the amount of tax you owe after all deductions are taken from your taxable income. For example, if you owe $3,000 in taxes and are eligible for a $1,100 tax credit, the amount you owe decreases to $1,900 ($3,000 - $1,100) after the tax break is applied.






Tax credits lower your tax bill on a dollar-for-dollar basis. On the other hand, tax deductions reduce your taxable income—or the amount of income on which your taxes are calculated. Tax credits are worth more than deductions because they directly reduce your tax bill.



Corporations can also take advantage of tax credits to lower their tax bills. The government permits these to benefit workers and the national economy. Certain credits are implemented regardless of the industry or sector, such as business tax credits, investment credits, and credits for child care for workers. They can also be more industry-specific, such as those in the agricultural, energy, and mining sectors.


  Tax Deductions  

Tax deductions are expenses that can be subtracted from your gross income to reduce your taxable income—and therefore, your tax bill. For example, a $1,000 tax deduction would lower your taxable income by that same amount. The value of the deduction depends on your tax bracket. So, if you are in the 22% tax bracket, that $1,000 tax deduction would save you $220 ($1,000 × 22%) on your tax bill.



Most taxpayers have the option to take the standard deduction (a fixed dollar amount based on your filing status) or itemize their deductions on Schedule A of Form 1040 or 1040-SR. Here's a rundown of the standard deduction amounts for 2022 and 2023:










Standard Deductions for 2022 and 2023


 Filing Status
2022 Standard Deduction
2023 Standard Deduction




Single
$12,950
$13,850


Married Filing Separately
$12,950
$13,850


Heads of Household
$19,400
$20,800


Married Filing Jointly
$25,900
$27,700


Surviving Spouses
$25,900
$27,700






Deductions you can itemize include:



Mortgage interest on the first $750,000 of secured mortgage debt (or $1 million if you bought the home before Dec. 16, 2017)
Unreimbursed medical and dental expenses that total more than 7.5% of your adjusted gross income (AGI)
Up to $10,000 in state and local taxes
Charitable contributions
Casualty and theft losses
Gambling losses



If the sum of the deductions you can itemize exceeds your standard deduction, it makes financial sense to itemize.


  Tax Exclusions  

A tax exclusion shelters a certain portion of income or type of income from taxation. For example, you can generally exclude child support payments, life insurance proceeds, and municipal bond income from your taxable income. Likewise, health insurance premiums your employer pays are exempt from federal income and payroll taxes, and the portion of premiums you pay is generally excluded from your taxable income.



Another common tax exclusion pertains to home sales. If you have a capital gain from selling your main home, you can exclude up to $250,000 ($500,000 if married filing jointly) of that gain from your income. To qualify, you must:



Have owned and lived in the home for at least two out of the previous five yearsNot have excluded the gain from the sale of another home within the past two years



Also, if you earn income in a foreign country, you may be eligible for a tax break through the foreign earned income exclusion. The total for an individual is $112,000 for the 2022 tax year and $120,000 for the 2023 tax year.




What Is the Difference Between Tax Credits and Tax Deductions?
Tax credits and tax deductions both save you money at tax time, but credits are more favorable. Tax credits lower the amount of tax you owe—dollar for dollar—while tax deductions reduce your taxable income. For instance, a $1,000 tax credit cuts $1,000 off your tax bill, and a $1,000 tax deduction lowers your taxable income by $1,000. So, if you fall into the 22% tax bracket, a $1,000 deduction would reduce your tax bill by $220.




Are Tax Credits Better Than Tax Deductions?
Many tax credits may yield better favorable results compared to tax deductions, especially if those tax credits are refundable. Refundable tax credits can reduce a taxpayer's liability below $0 and result in a refund. While tax deductions can only limit the taxability of an individual's income, some tax credits actually return a refund.




What Is the Annual Gift Exclusion for 2022?
The annual exclusion for gifts is $16,000 for 2022 and $17,000 in 2023. That means you can give up to $16,000 or $17,000 tax-free to as many people as you wish without using any of your lifetime gift and estate tax exemption.




Who Qualifies for Tax Breaks?
Broadly speaking, many tax breaks favor individuals with lower income. Many tax deductions and credits phase-out as an individuals income increases, meaning a person may only receive a partial amount of a tax break. Eventually, taxpayers with income "too high" will not quality for certain tax breaks.In addition, many tax breaks are designed for specific economic activity. For example, to incentive workers to contribute to their retirement accounts, certain contributions may receive favorable tax treatment. These types of tax breaks can be obtained by simply engaging in the qualification requirement.


   The Bottom Line  

The ultimate goal of many is to reduce their tax liability owed to the federal government. Individuals, corporations, and nonprofit entities all leverage tax breaks that exclude some income from being taxable, allow for parts of net income to be deductible, and permit certain credits to directly reduce taxes owed. In general, it's advisable to pursue tax breaks to limit your tax exposure.
What Is a Tax Credit?  

The term “tax credit” refers to an amount of money that taxpayers can subtract directly from the taxes they owe. This is different from tax deductions, which lower the amount of an individual’s taxable income.



The value of a tax credit depends on the nature of the credit. Certain types of tax credits are granted to individuals or businesses in specific locations, classifications, or industries.





Key Takeaways

A tax credit is an amount of money that taxpayers can subtract, dollar for dollar, from the income taxes they owe.Tax credits are more favorable than tax deductions because they reduce the tax due, not just the amount of taxable income.There are three basic types of tax credits: nonrefundable, refundable, and partially refundable.Nonrefundable tax credits can reduce the tax you owe to zero, but they don’t provide refunds.Refundable credits are paid out in full, providing a refund for any remaining tax credit amount beyond zero tax due.

   Understanding Tax Credits  

Federal and state governments may grant tax credits to promote specific behaviors that benefit the economy, the environment, or anything else that the government deems important.



For example, a tax credit is available that rewards people for installing solar panels for home use. Other tax credits help offset the costs of child and dependent care, education, and adoption.



Tax credits are more favorable than tax deductions because tax credits reduce tax liability dollar for dollar. While a deduction still reduces the final tax liability, it only does so within an individual’s marginal tax rate.



An individual in a 22% tax bracket, for example, would save $0.22 for every marginal tax dollar deducted. However, a credit would reduce the tax liability by the full $1.


   Types of Tax Credits  

There are three categories of tax credits: nonrefundable, refundable, and partially refundable.


  Nonrefundable Tax Credits  

Nonrefundable tax credits are amounts directly deducted from an individual’s tax liability until the tax due equals $0. Any amount greater than the tax owed, which normally results in a refund for the taxpayer, is not paid out as a refund. Hence the term “nonrefundable.” In effect, the remaining part of a nonrefundable tax credit that can’t be utilized is lost.



Nonrefundable tax credits are valid in the year of reporting only, expire after the return is filed, and may not be carried over to future years. Because of this, nonrefundable tax credits can negatively impact low-income taxpayers, as they are often unable to use the entire amount of the credit.



For the 2022 tax year, specific examples of nonrefundable tax credits include the:



Adoption credit
Lifetime Learning Credit
Residential energy credit
Work opportunity credit
Child and Dependent Care Credit
Other dependents credit
Retirement Savings Contributions Credit
Child Tax Credit (CTC)
Mortgage interest credit (helps lower-income taxpayers afford a home)


  Refundable Tax Credits  

Refundable tax credits are the most beneficial credit because they’re paid out in full. This means that a taxpayer (regardless of their income or tax liability) is entitled to the entire amount of the credit, beyond a zero amount of tax due. So, for example, if the refundable tax credit reduces the tax liability to below $0, then the taxpayer is due a refund of that specific amount.



One of the most popular refundable tax credits is probably the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC). The EITC is for low- to moderate-income taxpayers who earn income through an employer or by working as a self-employed individual and meet certain criteria based on income and number of family members.



The premium tax credit is also refundable. It helps individuals and families cover the cost of premiums for health insurance purchased through the health insurance marketplace.


  Partially Refundable Tax Credits  

Some tax credits are only partially refundable. One example is the American Opportunity Tax Credit (AOTC) for postsecondary education students.



If a taxpayer reduces their tax liability to $0 before using the entire portion of the $2,500 tax deduction, the remainder may be taken as a refundable credit up to the lesser of 40% of the remaining credit or $1,000. 



The Child Tax Credit was a partially refundable credit but became refundable (up to $1,500 in 2022 and $1,600 in 2023) as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA). If a taxpayer had a large enough tax liability, the full amount of the Child Tax Credit was $2,000.



This credit increased and became fully refundable as part of the American Rescue Plan for tax years 2020 and 2021.


   2021 American Rescue Plan Changes  

In March 2021, Congress passed the American Rescue Plan, which was signed into law by President Biden. Under the plan, eligible individuals received up to $1,400 in stimulus checks.



In addition, certain temporary changes were made to the Child Tax Credit for married couples filing jointly with a modified adjusted gross income (MAGI) up to $150,000, heads of household with MAGI up to $112,500, or single filers with MAGI up to $75,000:



Originally capped at $2,000 per eligible dependent child, the Child Tax Credit was increased to $3,000 for children ages 6 to 17 and $3,600 for children younger than 6.
The credit became fully refundable (previously, only $1,400 was refundable). The refundable amount was increased for 2022 and 2023 to $1,500 and $1,600, respectively.
In some cases, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) issued up to half of an eligible household’s credit as an advance disbursed between July and December 2021, using 2020 returns (or 2019 if 2020 was unavailable) to determine eligibility.
The bill eliminated the minimum income requirement. Previously, families earning less than $2,500 a year were ineligible and credits were calculated based on distance from that minimum at a rate of 15 cents per child for every dollar of income above $2,500.



Changes were also made to the EITC. Originally capped at $543 for childless households, the maximum Earned Income Tax Credit for those same households was $560 for 2022 and $600 for 2023. The bill also expanded eligibility for childless households. Previously, people under the age of 25 and over the age of 65 could not claim the credit. The upper limit was eliminated, and the lower limit was reduced to 19 (i.e., anyone 19 or older without a child who meets income requirements can claim the EITC).



Note a few exceptions: Students ages 19 to 24 with at least half a full-time course load are ineligible. Former foster children or youths experiencing homelessness can claim the credit as 18-year-olds. The phaseout percentage was increased to 15.3% for single filers, and phaseout amounts were increased to $11,610. 



The two EITC changes below are permanent:



People who otherwise would be eligible for the EITC but whose children do not have Social Security numbers will be permitted to claim the version of the credit meant for childless households.The investment income limit for 2021 was raised from $3,650 or less to $10,000 or less. This $10,000 figure will be pegged to inflation and adjusted accordingly every year going forward.






Except where noted, the American Rescue Plan measures above (including Child and Child/Dependent Care credits) were temporary and applied only to 2021. They revert to their previous forms for 2022 and beyond. 


   Example of a Tax Credit  

Let’s say that you’ve done your calculations and find that you owe the government a $2,000 tax payment for the year. But your tax advisor calls with good news: You’re eligible for a $2,500 refundable tax credit. This means that not only will your tax liability be eliminated, but you’ll also receive a $500 refund.



Should that tax credit have been nonrefundable, your financial benefit would have been limited to zero taxes owed. You wouldn’t receive a refund for the remaining $500 of tax credit.


   Common Tax Credits  

Here are some details about several of the common tax credits mentioned earlier.


  Child and Dependent Care Credit  

For 2022, the Child and Dependent Care Credit for expenses is nonrefundable. This credit helps individuals and couples reduce the costs of care for children younger than 13. It’s available to those who have to arrange for this care so that they can work or look for employment.



You may also receive the credit if you care for a spouse or a dependent of any age who cannot care for themselves.



For 2022, you may claim up to $3,000 for the care of one dependent or up to $6,000 for two or more. The credit ranges from 20% to 35% based on your income.



To qualify for this tax credit, your filing status must be single, married filing jointly, head of household, or qualifying widow or widower with a qualifying child.


  Lifetime Learning Credit  

The Lifetime Learning Credit can help offset the costs of any years of postsecondary education and whether or not you’re earning a degree.



The tax credit can be 20% of up to $10,000 in qualifying expenses related to education, or $2,000, for an eligible taxpayer, their spouse, or their dependent. For 2022, the full credit can be claimed if annual income is $80,000 or less for single filers or $160,000 or less for married couples filing jointly.


  Retirement Savings Contributions Credit  

The Retirement Savings Contributions Credit was created to encourage low- and moderate-income taxpayers to save for retirement. It can offset part of the first $2,000 that workers contribute to individual retirement accounts (IRAs), 401(k) plans, and certain other workplace retirement programs.



It applies to eligible contributions to retirement plans. You must be at least 18 years old and not a full-time student during the year. Also, you may not be claimed as a dependent on someone else’s tax return.



For 2022, the credit is available to those with maximum annual incomes of $34,000 for single filers, $51,000 for heads of household, and $68,000 for married couples filing jointly. The maximum credit is $1,000 for individuals or $2,000 for couples.


   Tax Credit vs. Tax Deduction  

Both tax credits and tax deductions are a welcome feature of tax time for any taxpayer. They both reduce money owed to the government in a given year. However, they differ in how they do so.


  Tax Credit  

A tax credit reduces the specific amount of the tax that an individual owes. For example, say that you have a $500 tax credit and a $3,500 tax bill. The tax credit would reduce your bill to $3,000.



You won’t be able to make the most of nonrefundable tax credits that reduce the amount of taxes you owe to zero and still have dollars left over. That amount isn’t refundable.



Refundable tax credits do provide you with a refund if they have money left over after reducing your tax bill to zero. As a result, they’re considered more valuable than nonrefundable tax credits.



There are also certain tax credits that result in a refund even if you had no tax liability.



You must meet certain criteria for tax credits, so be sure to check with a tax advisor or the information provided by the IRS.


  Tax Deduction  

A tax deduction reduces the amount of your income that is subject to taxation. For example, the contributions that you make to a 401(k) in a particular year reduce your taxable income by the total amount contributed.



You can choose to take the standard deduction offered to every taxpayer (for a single filer, it’s $12,950 for 2022 and $13,850 in 2023), or you can itemize your deductions. It’s one or the other, so be sure to consider whether individual deductions could save you more than the standard deduction before preparing your taxes.



Bear in mind that you’ll have to provide documentation for the deductions you itemize, whereas the standard deduction is automatic.



Here’s a quick comparison of the financial benefit offered by a tax credit vs. a tax deduction:

What are the 3 types of tax credits?
Tax credits can be nonrefundable, refundable, or partially refundable. Refundable tax credits are the most beneficial because once they reduce tax liability to $0, the taxpayer receives a refund for any remaining amount of the tax credit.




How much is a tax credit worth?
The amount of the credit depends on the type of credit you qualify for and other factors like your filing status and income. Tax credits reduce the amount of tax you owe, dollar for dollar.




What is the difference between a tax credit and a tax deduction?
Tax credits directly reduce the amount of tax you owe, while tax deductions reduce your taxable income. For example, a tax credit of $1,000 lowers your tax bill by that same $1,000. On the other hand, a $1,000 tax deduction lowers your taxable income (the amount of income on which you owe taxes) by $1,000. So, for example, if you fall into the 22% tax bracket, a $1,000 deduction would save you $220.


   The Bottom Line  

A tax credit is a financial benefit provided by the government. It is an amount of money that reduces the dollar amount of taxes owed. Refundable tax credits provide a refund of the amount of the credit that still exists after reducing taxes owed to zero. Nonrefundable tax credits allow for no such refund. Their benefit only extends to a reduced tax liability.



Tax deductions differ from tax credits in that they reduce taxable income, not the amount of an individual’s tax liability.
What Is Tax-Deductible Interest?  

Tax-deductible interest is a borrowing expense that a taxpayer can claim on a federal or state tax return to reduce their taxable income. Several types of interest are tax-deductible, including mortgage interest on a primary or second home, student loan interest, and interest on some business loans, including business credit cards.





Key Takeaways


Interest is the amount of money you pay a lender to borrow money.
The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) allows taxpayers to deduct several interest expenses, including home mortgage interest and student loan interest.
You can itemize investment interest and qualified mortgage interest (including points if you’re the buyer) on Schedule A of Form 1040 or 1040-SR.
The student loan interest deduction is an adjustment to income on your tax return, so you don’t need to itemize to take it.



   Understanding Tax-Deductible Interest  

Interest is the amount of money you pay a lender for the privilege of borrowing money or delaying the repayment of a debt. All loans incur interest, which the lender may roll into your monthly payment. For example, you pay back a portion of the principal (i.e., the amount you borrowed) plus interest every month with most mortgages. On the other hand, revolving loans—like credit cards—accrue interest only on unpaid balances.



To make certain loans more affordable, the IRS allows you to deduct several types of interest expenses, including:



Investment interestQualified mortgage interest (including points if you’re the buyer)Student loan interestNonfarm business interestFarm business interestInterest related to income-producing activities



Of course, not all types of interest are deductible. Specifically, the IRS does not allow you to deduct personal interest, such as:



The interest you pay on a loan to buy a car for personal use
Credit card and installment loan interest on personal expenses
Mortgage points (for sellers), service charges, credit investigation fees, and interest associated with tax-exempt income


   Student Loan Interest Tax Deduction  

While you can’t deduct your student loans, you can get a tax break for the interest you pay by claiming the student loan interest deduction. You can generally deduct the smaller of $2,500 or the interest you actually paid during the year; however, the deduction may be gradually reduced or eventually eliminated depending on your filing status and modified adjusted gross income (MAGI):

To claim the deduction, you must meet all of the following conditions:



You paid interest on a qualified student loan during the tax yearYou’re legally obligated to pay interest on a qualified student loanYour filing status is not married filing separatelyYour MAGI is less than the annual limitNobody else can claim you or your spouse (if you file jointly) as a dependent on their tax return






A qualified student loan is a loan you took out to pay qualified higher education expenses for you, your spouse, or your dependent. The loan can’t be from a related person or made under a qualified employer plan.



Additionally, the loan must pay for qualified educational expenses for you, your spouse, or your dependent during an academic period in which the student is enrolled at least part time in a degree program. Quarters, trimesters, semesters, and summer school sessions count as academic periods. Qualified expenses include:



Tuition and feesRoom and board included in the cost of attendanceBooks, supplies, and equipmentOther necessary expenses (e.g., transportation)



If you paid at least $600 in student loan interest, you should receive Form 1098-E from your student loan servicer. The student loan interest deduction is taken as an income adjustment, so you don’t need to itemize your deductions. Instead, you can enter the allowable amount directly on Form 1040 or 1040-SR.


   Mortgage Interest Tax Deduction  

You can deduct the mortgage interest you pay on the first $750,000 ($375,000 if married filing separately) of mortgage debt. If you bought the home before Dec. 16, 2017, the higher $1 million ($500,000 if married filing separately) limit applies. The loan must be secured by your main home or a second home.



According to the IRS, your main home is where you live most of the time, whether that’s a house, co-operative apartment, condominium, mobile home, house trailer, or houseboat. A second home can include any other residence you own and treat as a second home, even if you don’t use it during the year; however, if you rent out the property, you must use it for 14 days or at least 10% of the number of days you rent it—whichever is greater—for the interest to count as qualified residence interest. All homes must have sleeping, cooking, and toilet facilities.






You can deduct home equity loan interest, but only if you use the funds to buy, build, or substantially improve the home that secures the loan.



Your lender will send you Form 1098 to report qualified mortgage interest and points. To claim the tax break, you must itemize your deductions on Schedule A of your 1040 or 1040-SR form. You can also deduct the mortgage interest you pay on a rental property, but you report it on Schedule E since it counts as a business expense.


   Watch for Changes in What’s Deductible  

Interest deductions are subject to limitations and exclusions, which can change from year to year. For example, taxpayers used to be able to claim the mortgage interest deduction on the first $1 million of mortgage debt; however, the allowable amount is now just $750,000, thanks to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. Be sure that you understand the rules and confirm your eligibility before claiming any deductions. When in doubt, consult with a qualified tax professional.




What Is the Difference Between a Tax Credit and a Tax Deduction?
Tax credits and tax deductions reduce the amount of tax you owe, but they work differently. Tax credits come straight off your tax bill, while tax deductions decrease your taxable income.Say you’re eligible for a $1,000 tax credit and a $1,000 tax deduction. The tax credit lowers your tax bill by $1,000, while the tax deduction reduces your taxable income—the amount of income on which you owe taxes—by $1,000. Of the two, tax credits save you more money.




What Interest Is Tax-Deductible?
You can deduct several types of interest, including mortgage interest, student loan interest, investment interest, and business loan interest. You must meet specific requirements to qualify for each deduction.For example, you can deduct up to $2,500 of student loan interest, but only if your income is below $70,000 ($145,000 if you’re married filing jointly) for tax year 2022, and $75,000 and $155,000, respectively, in 2023.




What Is the Standard Deduction for Tax Year 2022?
For tax year 2022, the standard deduction is $12,950 for single and married filing separately taxpayers, $19,400 for heads of household, and $25,900 for married filing jointly filers and surviving spouses.




What Is the Standard Deduction for Tax Year 2023?
For tax year 2023, the standard deduction is $13,850 for single and married filing separately taxpayers, $20,800 for heads of household, and $27,700 for married filing jointly filers and surviving spouses.


   The Bottom Line  

Tax-deductible interest allows you to reduce your taxes by claiming allowable borrowing expenses. Student loan interest is taken as an income adjustment, so you don’t need to itemize your taxes to benefit from this tax break.



However, deducting investment interest and mortgage interest requires itemizing your taxes on Schedule A. Given the size of the standard deduction, it may not be worth your while to deduct these costs. Do the math each year to see which approach will work best for you.
What Is a Tax Deduction?  

A tax deduction is an amount that you can deduct from your taxable income to lower the amount of taxes that you owe. You can choose the standard deduction—a single deduction of a fixed amount—or itemize deductions on Schedule A of your income tax return.



If the total for your itemized expenses is greater than the standard deduction for your filing status, it makes sense to itemize. Allowable itemized deductions include mortgage interest, charitable gifts, unreimbursed medical expenses, and state and local taxes.





Key Takeaways

Tax deductions are subtracted from your taxable income, thereby lowering the amount of tax you owe.You can choose the standard deduction or itemize your deductions on Schedule A of Form 1040 or 1040-SR.The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) nearly doubled the standard deduction and improved several tax deductions.The TCJA also eliminated or limited many itemized deductions, including the mortgage interest deduction.If you itemize your deductions, be sure to keep receipts to substantiate your expenses.


   Understanding Tax Deductions  

Individuals can take the standard deduction—which nearly doubled under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act—or itemize their deductions. Here's a rundown of the standard deduction amounts for the 2022 and 2023 tax years:

Taxpayers at least 65 years old or blind can claim an additional standard deduction. For 2022, the extra amount is $1,400 ($1,750 for single filers and heads of households). Those over 65 and blind are entitled to double the additional amount ($2,800 or $3,500, depending on filing status). The amount rises to $1,500 in 2023 and $1,850 for single filers and heads of household.






You can take the standard deduction or itemize your deductions—you can't do both for the same tax year.


   Common Tax Deductions  

Here are some of the most common tax deductions that you can claim on your federal income tax return:



Up to $2,500 of student loan interest
Mortgage interest on up to $750,000 of secured home mortgage debt ($1 million if you bought the home before Dec. 16, 2017)
Contributions to a traditional individual retirement account (IRA), 401(k) plan, or another qualified retirement plan, up to annual limits
Up to $10,000 of state and local taxes
Contributions to a health savings account, up to annual limits
Medical and dental expenses exceeding 7.5% of your adjusted gross income
Self-employment expenses, including the home office deduction and health insurance premiums deduction
Charitable contributions
Investment losses
Gambling losses



Most of these deductions should be entered on Schedule A of your 1040, but there are some exceptions. For example, you must use Form 8949 and Schedule D to report investment losses and Form 5498 to record IRA contributions. Contributions to an employer-sponsored 401(k) retirement account are reflected in your paycheck, so you don't need the extra form.


   Deductions That Went Away in 2018  

Some once-common tax deductions were eliminated or capped by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (TCJA). You can no longer deduct the following—at least until 2025 when the act is due to expire:



Home equity loan interest (unless you spent the money to improve the home)
Mortgage interest on more than $750,000 of secured mortgage debt
Unreimbursed work expenses
State and local taxes above $5,000 (or $10,000 for a couple)
Dues for professional societies
Moving expenses (except for military personnel)
Casualty and theft losses (except in federally declared disaster areas)
The personal exemption
Tax preparation fees
Alimony payments
"Miscellaneous" itemized deductions


   Tax Deductions for the Self-Employed  

The ranks of freelancers and gig workers are growing. According to a Pew Research study, more than 16 million Americans now identify as self-employed.



Luckily for them, they have retained some of the tax deductions that wage earners lost in the 2017 tax reform law. Some deductions are complex because you have to determine how much of every expense is business, thus deductible—and how much is personal and nondeductible.



Some of the most important deductions for the self-employed include those for half of your Medicare and Social Security taxes, the home office deduction, and the health insurance premiums deduction.



One particularly valuable deduction for self-employed people defers taxes on their contributions to retirement plans. Tax-deferred retirement plans—including the SEP-IRA, the SIMPLE IRA, and the solo 401(k)—are designed specifically for the self-employed, solo operators, and small business owners.






Contributions to traditional IRAs and qualified plans such as 401(k)s are an "above the line" deduction. That means the contribution will reduce your taxable income even if you choose to take the standard deduction instead of itemizing.


   Small Business Tax Deductions  

Businesses large and small pay taxes on their profits, which is their total receipts minus their total business costs. That means recording every single expense and reporting it to the IRS. Some of the top deductions for small business owners include:



Advertising and promotionBad debtsBooksBusiness travelCharitable contributionsContinuing educationEquipmentInsuranceLegal and professional feesLicense and regulatory feesLoan interestPass-through tax deductionRepair and maintenanceTaxes (local, sales, and property taxes)Vehicle expensesStartup costs



The rules for many of these deductions are complex, particularly for shoestring operations. Vehicle expenses and travel expenses, for example, must be carefully separated between deductible business use and nondeductible personal or family use.


   Tax Deductions vs. Tax Credits  

Tax deductions reduce your total taxable income—the amount you use to calculate your tax bill. On the other hand, tax credits are subtracted directly from the taxes you owe. Some tax credits are even refundable, meaning that if the credits reduce your tax bill to below zero, you'll get a refund for the difference.



Even if they aren't refundable, a tax credit is more valuable than a tax deduction. A tax deduction may kick your taxable income down a few notches on the tax tables, but a tax credit reduces the tax you owe, dollar for dollar.


   Example of a Tax Deduction  

Here's an example. Consider a single taxpayer reporting an earned income of $90,000 in 2022. That puts the person in the 24% tax bracket. So their tax bill for tax year 2022 would be $15,213.50 plus 24% of the excess over $89,075 ($925) which comes out to a total of $15,435.50 ($15,213.50 + $222). Like all taxpayers, this individual can choose to itemize deductions or take the standard deduction.


  If the Taxpayer Itemizes  

The taxpayer has paid $10,000 in mortgage interest and has contributed $6,000 to a traditional IRA. Both are deductible expenses.



With a total of $16,000 in deductions to report, the taxpayer will owe income taxes on $74,000 ($90,000 - $16,000) of earned income. Therefore, the person will owe $11,897 in taxes for the year ($4807.50 plus 22% of the excess over $41,775). That's less than the original tax owed of $15,435.50 shown above.


  If the Taxpayer Takes the Standard Deduction  

The standard deduction for a single filer is $12,950 for the 2022 tax year. It's important to note that the taxpayer gets the additional aforementioned $6,000 deduction for the IRA contribution. It's an "above-the-line" deduction, reducing this taxpayer's gross income from $90,000 to $84,000. The standard deduction further reduces the filer's taxable income to $71,050. Thus, with the standard deduction, the taxpayer will owe $11,248 ($4807.50 plus 22% of the excess over $41,775).



That's less than taxes owed after itemizing deductions. So, even with a hefty mortgage interest write-off, the taxpayer would save $649 by taking the standard deduction.


   Standard Deductions vs. Itemized Deductions  

Generally speaking, U.S. taxpayers will choose to itemize their deductions or take the standard deduction, depending on which most reduces their taxable income.



Contrary to what many taxpayers may think, they might benefit most from the standard deduction because the TCJA nearly doubled the standard deduction amount and eliminated (or capped) many itemized deductions.



If you itemize, you need to keep receipts for eligible expenses throughout the year and organize them into categories. At tax time, you tally and record the expenses on a Schedule A—and hold onto the receipts in case you're audited.



The standard deduction is substantially less work: You simply fill in the amount of your standard deduction on line 12a of Form 1040 or 1040-SR.


   State Tax Deductions  

Most of the 41 states that impose an income tax follow the format of the federal forms as closely as possible. However, the states set their own tax rates and standard deductions, and they may have additional allowable deductions or different restrictions on deductions.



Some states do not permit taxpayers to itemize state taxes if they take the federal tax deduction.



In any case, it's worth reading your state's tax forms closely to see if there are any additional deductions for which you might qualify. For example, in New Mexico, you are exempt from state income tax when you reach age 100. And Nevada taxpayers can get a free pack of cards for filing their tax returns.


   Limits on Tax Deductions  

Keep in mind that there are limitations on some deductions. For example, current federal tax law limits the mortgage interest deduction to a maximum of $750,000 of secured mortgage debt (or $1 million if you bought the home prior to Dec. 16, 2017). That 2017 change was a severe blow to the very wealthy and to some not-so-wealthy residents of the cities with the most expensive homes.



Then there's the limit on the healthcare deduction. If you're itemizing healthcare costs, the expenses that you paid (for yourself, your spouse, and your dependents) must exceed a certain percentage of your adjusted gross income (AGI) to be deductible. For your 2022 tax return, the threshold for medical expenses is 7.5% of AGI for all taxpayers.


   Capital Loss Carryforward  

One additional deduction not included in the standard or itemized tax deductions is the one for capital losses. These are recorded on Schedule D, along with capital gains, rather than on Schedule A.



A tax loss carryforward is a legal way to rearrange earnings for the taxpayer's benefit. You can carry forward individual and business capital losses from previous years. You can claim up to $3,000 ($1,500 if married filing separately) in capital losses as a tax deduction as of the 2022 tax year (the tax return you file in 2023). If your losses were greater than that, you can "carry them forward" to the following year or years.




What Can I Write Off on My Taxes?
There are dozens of tax deductions and credits that can help lower your tax bill. Some of the more common deductions include those for mortgage interest, retirement plan contributions, HSA contributions, student loan interest, charitable contributions, medical and dental expenses, gambling losses, and state and local taxes.Common credits include the child tax credit, earned income tax credit, child and dependent care credit, saver's credit, foreign tax credit, American opportunity credit, lifetime learning credit, and premium tax credit.




How Can I Maximize My Tax Deductions?
Whether you itemize or take the standard deduction, it helps to contribute the maximum allowable amount to a traditional (i.e., not Roth) retirement account like an IRA or a 401(k). That way, you'll be adding to your retirement savings while reducing your taxes for the year.If you have substantial mortgage interest, student debt interest, medical expenses, and other deductible expenses, you may find the total exceeds the standard deduction. In that case, you can maximize your deductions by itemizing on Schedule A of Form 1040 or 1040-SR.




What Is the Maximum Tax Refund You Can Get?
There is no maximum. However, the average direct deposit refund for individuals in the 2022 tax filing season was $3,121, according to the IRS.


   The Bottom Line  

A tax deduction is an amount that the IRS allows taxpayers to deduct from their taxable income, thus reducing the tax that they owe.



Taxpayers can either itemize individual deductions that they're entitled to on their tax returns or opt for the standard deduction allowed (a single amount). The approach you choose will most likely be the one that lowers your tax bill the most.



While many taxpayers may think that itemizing is the better choice, the standard deduction was nearly doubled by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. In certain circumstances, it may reduce your tax bill more than itemizing.
What Is a Tax Deed?  

The term “tax deed” refers to a legal document granting ownership of a property to a government body when the owner fails to pay any associated property taxes. A tax deed gives the government agency the authority to sell the property to collect the delinquent taxes. Once sold, the property is then transferred to the purchaser. These transactions are called “tax deed sales” and are usually held at auctions.





Key Takeaways

A tax deed grants ownership of a property to a government body when the owner fails to pay the associated property taxes.Tax deeds are sold to the highest bidder at auction for a minimum bid of the outstanding taxes plus interest and the costs associated with the sale.Successful bidders have a minimum amount of time to pay for the purchase—usually 48 to 72 hours.At the close of the auction, the county receives the total delinquent tax assessment, and the former owner receives the net proceeds after taxes and penalties. Property owners may file a claim to receive any amount paid to the municipality in excess of the property taxes plus interest.


   Understanding a Tax Deed  

A property tax is any tax paid on a piece of real property. Taxes are assessed by the municipal government in which the property is located and paid by the owners of real estate. There is an implied understanding that owners of real estate property are responsible for paying property tax assessments.



The taxes collected are used to fund various municipal programs such as water and sewer improvements, law enforcement and fire service, education, road and highway construction, public servants, and other services. Property tax rates vary by jurisdiction.



When property taxes are left unpaid, the taxing authority may sell the property’s deed or title—and therefore, the property—to recover the outstanding taxes. The taxing authority—usually a county government—must go through a series of legal steps in order to acquire a tax deed. These steps vary with local and municipal laws but include notifying the property owner, applying for the tax deed, posting a notice at the property, and posting a public notice of sale.


   What Is a Tax Deed Sale?  

In a tax deed sale, the property with the associated delinquent property taxes is sold. The sale takes place through an auction with a minimum bid of the amount of back taxes owed plus interest, as well as costs associated with selling the property. The highest bidder wins the property.



The tax deed legally transfers ownership to the purchaser on one condition: The new owner must often pay the entire amount owed within 48 to 72 hours, or the sale is canceled. Any amount bid by the winning bidder in excess of the minimum bid may or may not be remitted to the delinquent owner. This depends on the jurisdiction.



The original owner may forfeit this excess amount if they do not claim it within a specified period of time. In California, for example, claims must be filed within one year, while the deadline in Texas is two years. In Georgia, funds can be claimed up to five years after a tax deed sale, at which point a court order is required to retrieve excess funds.






Some states have a redemption period during which the original owner may pay back their tax debt and reacquire their former property.


   Special Considerations  

While some states sell the title to the winning bidder the day of the tax deed sale auction, others will allow a redemption period during which the original owner has an opportunity to repay their tax debt and redeem the property. If the owner chooses to pay their debt obligations within this period, they must pay the winning bidder the amount bid at the auction plus interest, which can be quite high.



However, if the redemption period passes, and the owner still does not reclaim their property deed, the highest bidder has a chance to foreclose on the property. The redemption period in Idaho, for example, is 14 months, while owners in Iowa have one year and nine months to redeem their property.


   Tax Deeds vs. Tax Liens  

Tax liens are similar to tax deeds, but there are some subtle differences. While tax deeds transfer ownership of the property itself to a new party, tax liens are a legal claim against the property when the taxes aren’t paid. Tax liens provide a relatively cheap investment for investors with a guaranteed return. Liens can cost anywhere from a few hundred to a few thousand dollars and pay simple interest that accrues on a monthly basis.



The lien process begins government body places a lien against a property if its owner defaults on their property taxes. These liens, which prevent owners from doing anything with the property, including refinancing or selling it, are sold off at auction rather than the property itself. Interested parties can invest in these tax liens by bidding for them. The return is based on a maximum rate of interest allowed by the municipality.



When a property owner defaults on their property, the municipality sends a notice advising them of the upcoming tax lien. If the owner doesn’t bring the taxes up to date, the tax lien is then put up for auction. The lien is transferred to the highest bidder, who pays the outstanding tax amount to the municipality. In order to remove the lien, the property owner must pay the new lien owner the outstanding amount plus interest.






Foreclosure auctions are typically conducted once a year. For example, 2022 foreclosures in King County (Seattle, WA) will not occur until September 2023.


   Example of a Tax Deed Sale  

Assume the value of a property in a tax deed sale is assessed to be $100,000 and has $5,700 in back taxes. The highest bid on the property is $49,000.



The county will take $5,700 from the bid amount to cover the property taxes due, and the remainder will be paid to the original owner. In this example, $5,700 is remit to the county and $43,300 ($49,000 - $5,700) is remit to the original owner.



The bidder gets title of the home and an equity profit of $100,000 - $49,000 = $51,000.




What Is the Difference Between a Tax Deed and Tax Lien?
A tax lien is a legal designation that one party has rights to collect proceeds or value from a property. All liens are subsequent rights to receive value from an asset. A tax deed is the full transmittal of the title of a property due to property tax delinquency.




How Do I Clear a Tax Deed?
A tax deed or tax deed sale arises due to unpaid property taxes. If all tax obligations are cleared and associated penalties, interest, and fees are paid, a tax deed will often clear prior to auction and remain with the original property owner.




What Happens If I Do Not Pay Property Taxes?
Property taxes are sanctioned by municipal government bodies and are legal obligations for owning real estate. By not paying property taxes, the government has the right to seize your property, claim rights over proceeds to cover their owed obligations and dispose of a property to a new owner. The rules around this tax deed process varies between government entities.
What Does Tax-Deferred Mean?  

Tax-deferred status refers to investment earnings—such as interest, dividends, or capital gains—that accumulate tax-free until the investor takes constructive receipt of the profits. Some common examples of tax-deferred investments include individual retirement accounts (IRAs) and deferred annuities.





Key Takeaways

Tax-deferred status refers to investment earnings—such as interest, dividends, or capital gains—that accumulate tax-free until the investor takes constructive receipt of the profits.An investor benefits from the tax-free growth of earnings with tax-deferred investments, and if held until retirement, the tax savings can be substantial.An example of a tax-deferred vehicle is a 401(k) plan: A tax-qualified defined contribution account offered by employers to help grow employees’ retirement savings.


   Understanding Tax-Deferred  

An investor benefits from the tax-free growth of earnings with tax-deferred investments. For investments held until retirement, the tax savings can be substantial. At retirement, the retiree will likely be in a lower tax bracket and no longer subject to premature tax and product withdrawal penalties.



Investing in qualified products, such as IRAs, allows participants to claim some or all of their contributions as a deduction on their tax returns. The benefit of declaring deductions in current years and incurring lower taxation in later years makes tax-deferred investments attractive.


   Qualified Tax-Deferred Vehicles  

A 401(k) plan is a tax-qualified defined contribution account offered by employers to help grow employees’ retirement savings. Companies employ a third-party administrator (TPA) to manage contributions, which are deducted from employee earnings.



Employees choose to invest these contributions among various options, such as equity funds, company stock, money-market equivalents, or fixed-rate options. Contributions to qualified savings plans, such as 401(k) accounts, are made on a pre-tax basis, reducing taxable income received by the employee, which typically equates to lower tax liability.



Distributions from qualified plans are taxable as ordinary income if the owner is under the age of 59½. The IRS may assess a 10% premature withdrawal penalty. Tax-deferral and employer dollar-matching provisions encourage employees to set aside wages for retirement savings.


   Nonqualified Tax-Deferred Vehicles  

Because contributions to a nonqualified plan are from post-tax income, they do not reduce taxable income. However, if tax-deferred, the earnings may accumulate tax-free. The contributions establish a cost basis for interest calculations. 



On distributions, only the earnings are taxable—hence, the name deferred annuities. Deferred annuities are attractive insurance products that embrace the benefits of tax deferral. Individual retirement accounts, such as traditional IRAs, limit annual contribution amounts. For 2023 , the contribution limit is $6,500, or $7,500 if a person is age 50 or older, up from $6,000 (or $7,000 for those 50 and older) in 2022. However, many annuities and other nonqualified tax-deferred products do not restrict contribution amounts.
What Is the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982 (TEFRA)?  

The Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982 (TEFRA) is a law passed in 1982 that was designed to reduce the federal budget deficit through a combination of tax increases, spending cuts, and tax reform measures.



The legislation reversed some elements of the Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981 (ERTA), also known as the Kemp-Roth Act.



Both pieces of legislation were passed early in the presidency of Ronald Reagan.





Key Takeaways

The Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982 was the biggest tax increase in U.S. history, when adjusted for inflation.The legislation quickly followed the Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981, which was the biggest tax cut in U.S. history.Following the passage of ERTA, the U.S. fell into the second half of a "double-dip" recession, and the U.S. budget deficit was soaring.TEFRA supporters said its aim was to close tax loopholes introducing stricter compliance and tax-collection measures, rather than raise taxes.TEFRA also rescinded some ERTA reductions in personal income-tax rates that had not yet gone into effect.


   Understanding the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982 (TEFRA)  

Shaped by Republican Senator Robert Dole, then chair of the Senate Finance Committee, TEFRA was meant to raise more revenue by closing loopholes in the tax system, introducing stricter compliance and tax-collection measures, increasing excise taxes on cigarettes and telephone services, and increasing corporate taxes.



Adjusted for inflation, TEFRA remains the biggest tax increase in U.S. history. It was largely a repudiation of the ERTA, which had passed a year earlier and remains the largest tax cut in U.S. history.



At the time TEFRA was being debated in Congress, the U.S. economy was in the middle of a recession. Some called it a "double-dip" recession because the economy fell to recessionary levels, recovered, and then fell again into recession, all in the single 12-month period between the summer of 1981 and the summer of 1982. Government revenues fell by about 6% due to a combination of ERTA tax cuts and normal recessionary effects.



The result was a budget deficit that grew to a then-record $110.7 billion in 1982. (In 2021, the federal budget deficit was $2.8 trillion.)



TEFRA also rescinded some ERTA reductions in personal income-tax rates that had not yet gone into effect.





No Tax Breaks for Drug Dealers

An obscure provision of TEFRA came back to haunt the legal marijuana industry decades later. The provision, probably inserted as a political throwaway line, forbids those "trafficking in controlled substances" from using most business tax deductions.


   Other Elements of TEFRA  

TEFRA ultimately touched a vast number of Americans in its efforts to reduce federal spending and increase government revenues.



For example, many of the reimbursement rules for the Medicare and Medicaid programs were revised to rein in their costs. Procedures for payments of Social Security, and Unemployment Compensation were altered.



The bill temporarily doubled the federal cigarette tax and tripled the telephone service tax.



It also had an impact on businesses and investors. TEFRA abolished some of the tax breaks businesses received under ERTA, such as accelerated depreciation. It also instituted a 10% withholding tax on dividends and interest paid to individuals who did not have certified tax identification numbers.


   Historic Tax Increase Under TEFRA  

President Ronald Reagan had campaigned on tax cuts and limited government. Early in his first term, he had won a then-substantial $28.3 billion in tax cuts for business through the passage of ERTA.



Many were puzzled that he would agree to undo some of the tax breaks created in ERTA, which had been a significant legislative achievement. But he could not ignore the growing deficit.



In fact, Reagan resisted any tax increases for a time but eventually relented in exchange for a pledge for even bigger spending cuts as part of the deal.



When he finally signed the bill into law on Sept. 3, 1982, Reagan stressed that the measure increased taxes largely by closing loopholes and that it would raise more than $98 billion over three years while cutting spending by $280 billion during the same period.



That figure was disputed. The Heritage Foundation claimed at the time that the bill would actually increase spending by 21 cents for every dollar brought in through tax increases.

What U.S. Senator Championed TEFRA in Congress?
Sen. Bob Dole's name is inextricably linked with TEFRA, and not necessarily in a good way.The Kansas Republican served in the U.S. Senate for 30 years, including three years as Senate Majority Leader.As the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, Dole was the legislator most responsible for shaping TEFRA and pushing it through the Senate.Many conservatives were outraged. Then-freshman House Rep. Newt Gingrich called Dole "the tax collector for the welfare state."His association with "the biggest tax increase in U.S. history" would come back to haunt him in 1995, when he ran unsuccessfully for the presidency.




What Are the Key Provisions of TEFRA?
TEFRA's proponents emphasized toughening tax enforcement in order to close the so-called "tax gap."This was based on assumption that one in five tax dollars never made it into the government coffers due to unreported income or overstated deductions, expenses, and exemptions.Many of the provisions hit individuals, not businesses:A crackdown on underreporting of tips received by waiters and others who earn tips as part of their income.A requirement for an automatic 10% tax withholding on dividends and interest paid to individuals.A requirement for tax withholding on payments of pensions and annuities.The bill also increased penalties for non-compliance.




How Did TEFRA Provisions Impact the U.S. Healthcare System?
TEFRA includes many changes to the Medicaid and Medicare reimbursement systems that were intended to save the government money.However, one of the most durable and significant provisions of TEFRA is known to this day as TEFRA Medicaid. This provision allows states to extend certain in-home Medicaid services to children with disabilities regardless of their family income.




Why Did Congress Increase Taxes in 1982?
Public concern over the size of the federal budget deficit tends to wax and wane over time. In the early 1980s, concern was high. Oddly, the deficit was not all that high, historically speaking, although it did decline after the passage of TEFRA.


   The Bottom Line  

The Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act was an attempt to raise government revenue without raising income taxes. Its focus was on toughening tax enforcement to close the so-called "tax gap" of unreported and under-reported income.



That sounds more palatable politically, but TEFRA did have an impact on the incomes of millions of Americans, from waitresses dependent on tips to senior citizens dependent on pensions.
What Is the Tax-Equivalent Yield?  

The tax-equivalent yield is the return that a taxable bond would need to equal the yield on a comparable tax-exempt municipal bond. The calculation is a tool that investors can use to compare the returns between a tax-free investment and a taxable alternative.





Key Takeaways

The tax-equivalent yield is the return that a taxable bond would need to yield in order to equal the yield on a comparable tax-exempt bond, such as a municipal bond.The calculation is a tool that investors can use to compare the returns between a tax-free investment and a taxable alternative.Tax implications, in general, are a complicated and important part of any financial strategy, as well as an often overlooked part.

   Understanding Tax-Equivalent Yield  

Tax implications, in general, are a complicated and important part of any financial strategy, as well as an often overlooked part. The tax-equivalent yield calculation is a useful tool for investors, especially those in higher tax brackets. The tax-equivalent yield is the yield on a taxable bond that an investor would have to earn to match the return on a comparable tax-free municipal bond.



Municipal bonds generally have a low expected return, so the full impact of investing in them due to tax savings is often not quantified completely. The calculation helps an investor to decide whether to select a taxable investment or a tax-free investment, such as a tax-free municipal bond. This information is crucial because the tax-free advantage that municipal bonds offer can be hard to match with other investments. 



However, it is not the end of the story. Some additional tax considerations can come into play when making such a comparison. While municipal bonds are free of federal taxes, some states do tax the earnings. The liquidity of municipal bonds may also be limited.


   Tax-Equivalent Yield Formula  

Depending on an investor's tax bracket, a municipal bond may not be the best investment decision for their portfolio. An investor's tax bracket will depend on their filing status and income. The federal income tax brackets for 2020 and 2021 are 10%, 12%, 22%, 24%, 32%, 35%, and 37%.



To calculate the taxable equivalent yield of a tax-free municipal bond, use the following formula and be sure to include any state taxes along with your federal tax rate.



ReturnTEY = ReturnTX ÷ (1 – t)



Where:



ReturnTEY: Return on fully taxable equivalent yieldReturnTX: Return on tax exempt investmentt: Investor's marginal tax rate



This formula can be reversed to determine the tax-free equivalent yield of a municipal bond that would match the return on a taxable bond.


   Example of Tax-Equivalent Yield Formula Calculations  

An investor's tax rate plays a significant role in the resulting tax-equivalent yields. For example, assume there is a tax-free bond that is yielding 7%. A decision to invest in this particular bond or any of the many taxable choices available greatly depends on the investor's marginal tax bracket. In the United States, as of 2020, there are seven different marginal tax-rate brackets: 10%, 12%, 22%, 24%, 32%, and 35%. The tax-equivalent yield calculations for these brackets are as follows:



10% Bracket: R(te) = 7% / (1 - 10%) = 7.78%12% Bracket: R(te) = 7% / (1 - 12%) = 7.95%22% Bracket: R(te) = 7% / (1 - 22%) = 8.97%24% Bracket: R(te) = 7% / (1 - 24%) = 9.21%32% Bracket: R(te) = 7% / (1 - 32%) = 10.29%35% Bracket: R(te) = 7% / (1 - 35%) = 10.77%37% Bracket: R(te) = 7% / (1 - 37%) = 11.11%



Given this information, assume there is a taxable bond that is yielding 9.75%. In this situation, investors in the first four marginal tax brackets would be better off investing in the taxable bond, because even after paying their tax liability, they would still earn more than a 7% non-taxable bond. Investors in the highest three brackets would be better off investing in the tax-free bond. Note, however, that none of this is investment advice, a tax or financial advisor should be consulted.


   Example of Tax-Equivalent Yield  

An investor in the 22% federal income tax bracket, and no state taxes, owns a tax-exempt municipal bond with an 8% coupon rate. To calculate the fully taxable equivalent yield that a taxable bond would have to earn to match the municipal bond's yield, use the above formula.



ReturnTEY = 0.08 ÷ (1 – 0.22) = 10.26%



In other words, a taxable bond would have to earn an equivalent yield of 10.26%, where after taxes are deducted it would match the 8% return of the tax-free municipal bond.



If the marginal tax rate is higher, the required fully taxable equivalent yield will also be higher than 10.26%. So, if all else remains the same, with the only difference being that the investor is in the 37% tax bracket, the fully taxable equivalent yield would have to be:



ReturnTEY = 0.08 ÷ (1 - 0.37) = 12.70%


   Why Are Municipal Bonds Tax-Exempt?  

Interest earned on state and local bonds has been tax-exempt since the introduction of the federal income tax in 1913. Initially, this was because many people felt the Constitution prevented the federal government from taxing this income. Since then, the justification for tax exclusion has been supported by the idea that local infrastructure projects serve the common good, and therefore, federal tax policy should support those projects.



Municipal bonds are not always tax-free. Federal taxes may apply to a municipal bond if the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) does not interpret a project as good for the entire public. Taxable municipal bonds are rare, but they can be issued for projects such as a sports stadium or a pension shortfall. The IRS can also treat municipal interest income as taxable if a bond is purchased at a significant discount to par value.



A mutual fund composed of tax-free bonds is still subject to capital gains tax.
What Is Tax Evasion?  

Tax evasion is an illegal activity in which a person or entity deliberately avoids paying a true tax liability. Those caught evading taxes are generally subject to criminal charges and substantial penalties. To willfully fail to pay taxes is a federal offense under the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) tax code.





Key Takeaways

Tax evasion can be either the illegal non-payment or underpayment of actual tax liabilities due. Tax evasion can be determined by the IRS regardless of whether or not tax forms were filed with the agency.To determine tax evasion, the agency must be able to show that the avoidance of taxes was willful on the part of the taxpayer. While tax evasion is illegal, tax avoidance includes finding legal ways (within the law) to reduce taxpayer obligations. 


   Understanding Tax Evasion  

Tax evasion applies to both the illegal nonpayment as well as the illegal underpayment of taxes. Even if a taxpayer fails to submit appropriate tax forms, the IRS can still determine if taxes were owed based on the information required to be sent in by third parties, such as W-2 information from a person’s employer or 1099s. Generally, a person is not considered to be guilty of tax evasion unless the failure to pay is deemed intentional.






Tax evasion occurs when a person or business illegally avoids paying their tax liability, which is a criminal charge that’s subject to penalties and fines. 



Failure to pay proper taxes can lead to criminal charges. In order for charges to be levied, it must be determined that the avoidance of taxes was a willful act on the part of the taxpayer. Not only can a person be liable for payment of any taxes that have been left unpaid, but they can also be found guilty of official charges and may be required to serve jail time. According to the IRS, the penalties include jail time of no more than five years, a fine of no more than $250,000 for individuals or $500,000 for corporations, or both—along with the costs of prosecution.


   What Qualifies As Tax Evasion?  

When determining if the act of failure to pay was intentional, a variety of factors are considered. Most commonly, a taxpayer’s financial situation will be examined in an effort to confirm if the nonpayment was the result of committing fraud or of the concealment of reportable income.



A failure to pay may be judged fraudulent in cases where a taxpayer made efforts to conceal assets by associating them with a person other than themselves. This can include reporting income under a false name and Social Security Number (SSN), which can also constitute identity theft. A person may be judged as concealing income for failure to report work that did not follow traditional payment recording methods. This can include acceptance of a cash payment for goods or services rendered without reporting them properly to the IRS during a tax filing.


   Tax Evasion vs. Tax Avoidance  

While tax evasion requires the use of illegal methods to avoid paying proper taxes, tax avoidance uses legal means to lower the obligations of a taxpayer. This can include efforts such as charitable giving to an approved entity or the investment of income into a tax deferred mechanism, such as an individual retirement account (IRA). In the case of an IRA, taxes on the invested funds are not paid until the funds, and any applicable interest payments, have been withdrawn.
Tax-exempt refers to income or transactions that are free from tax at the federal, state, or local level. The reporting of tax-free items may be on a taxpayer's individual or business tax return and shown for informational purposes only. The tax-exempt article is not part of any tax calculations.



Tax-exempt may also refer to the status of a business or organization which has limits on the amount of income or gifts which are taxable. These organizations include religious and charitable institutions.





Key Takeaways

Tax-exempt status allows a taxpayer to file a return with the IRS that exempts them from paying taxes on any net income or profit.A taxpayer can offset capital gains and avoid taxes on disposed assets, though this often allows a taxpayer to be exempt up to their current or prior losses.Taxpayers who avoid taxes may still be required to pay alternative minimum taxes. Most commonly, organizations gain tax-exempt status by requesting the status from the IRS.To maintain the status, organizations must meet ongoing filing and reporting requirements.


   Common Tax Exempt Earnings  

Not to be confused with a tax deduction, tax-exempt frees the taxpayer of any tax obligation to submit taxes on the tax-free transaction or income. Whereas, the use of a tax deduction is to reduce the tax obligation by lowering gross income.



One common type of tax-exempt income is interest earned on municipal bonds, which are bonds issued by states and cities to raise funds for general operations or a specific project. When a taxpayer makes interest income on municipal bonds issued in their state of residence, the profit is exempt from both federal and state taxes.



Taxpayers receive IRS Form 1099-INT for any investment interest they earn during the tax year. The reporting of tax-exempt interest is in box 8 of the 1099 form. This informational only data are not included in the calculation of personal income taxes.


   Capital Gains Tax Exemption  

A taxpayer may buy an asset and subsequently sell that asset for a profit. The profit is a capital gain, which creates a taxable event. However, several types of capital gains are exempt from taxation. 



A taxpayer can offset capital gains with other capital losses for the tax year. For example, an investor with $5,000 in profits and $3,000 in losses pays taxes on only $2,000 in capital gains. The amount of capital losses a taxpayer may claim in a given year has a cap of $3,000. When capital losses exceed this cap, the excess may be carried forward to offset gains in future years. 



The tax code also allows taxpayers to exclude from federal taxes a specific portion of capital gains from the sale of a home.






"Normal" taxpayers simply aren't exempt from capital gains; they must have losses to offset to avoid taxes.


   Alternative Minimum Tax and Exemptions  

The alternative minimum tax (AMT) is an alternative method for determining tax liability. AMT adds back specific tax-exempt items into the personal tax calculation. Interest from private activity bonds exempt from regular tax, for example, is added to the AMT tax calculation. Individual taxpayers must include the AMT calculation with their original tax return and pay tax on the higher tax liability.


   Tax-Exempt Organizations  

An exempt organization that has $1,000 or more of gross income from an unrelated business must file Form 990-T. An organization must pay estimated tax if it expects its tax for the year to be $500 or more.



A 501(c)(3) nonprofit corporation is a charitable organization that the IRS recognizes as tax-exempt. This type of organization does not pay income tax on its earnings or on the donations it receives. Also, any taxpayer donations may reduce a taxpayer's taxable income by the donation amount. This incentive encourages private charity and makes it easier for nonprofits to raise money.



A 501(c)(3) is a charitable organization involved in religious, charitable, educational, literary, preventing cruelty to animals and children, fostering amateur local and international sports competitions, testing for public safety, and scientific activities or operations.






To gain the exemption, an organization must demonstrate how it will serve the public and provide benefit to a community.


   Becoming Tax-Exempt  

An entity can become tax-exempt by meeting the requirements set forth by the IRS. There are several categories of tax-exempt status for charitable, religious, educational, and scientific organizations. The type of tax-exempt status needed will depend on the nature of the organization's activities.



The organization must be formed as a legal entity, and the organization must obtain an EIN from the IRS. With this EIN, the organization is able to file an application with the IRS to obtain tax-exempt status. The most common form is Form 1023 for 501(c)(3) organizations. The application must provide detailed information about the organization's activities, governance, finances, and other relevant information.



The IRS will review the application and make a determination about the organization's tax-exempt status. The process can take several months, and the IRS may request additional information or clarification during the review process. Once tax-exempt status is granted, the organization must maintain compliance with IRS rules and regulations via filing annual tax returns and other forms, meeting governance and operational requirements, and avoiding prohibited activities that could jeopardize tax-exempt status.


   Tax-Exempt Organization vs. Nonprofit Organization  

Though often interchanged to describe the same entity, there are worthwhile differences to mention between a tax-exempt organization and a nonprofit organization.



A nonprofit organization is a type of entity that is organized for a specific purpose. Nonprofits can be structured in a variety of ways such as a corporation, trust, or unincorporated association. They are not required to pay federal income taxes on their earnings.



A tax-exempt entity, on the other hand, is an organization that has been granted exemption from federal income tax by the IRS. Though this includes most nonprofit organizations, not all nonprofits are automatically tax-exempt. In addition, a nonprofit must apply to become tax exempt; without the review and approval by the IRS, the nonprofit will technically not be tax-exempt.




Is a Tax-Exempt Organization the Same As a 501(c)(3) Organization?
A 501(c)(3) is a tax-exempt organization recognized by the IRS. However, there are other forms of organization an entity can file for and be awarded that are also tax-exempt. Therefore, while a 501(c) is tax-exempt, not all tax-exempt organizations are 501(c)(3) organizations.




What Is the Downside of Being Tax-Exempt?
Administratively, there may be additional requirements a company must meet such as annual reporting and meeting stipulated criteria. To become and maintain its status as tax-exempt, there is an additional burden to an organization from a time and labor standpoint. Outside of this reporting and filing requirement, there are often little to no downsides of becoming tax-exempt.




Why Do Nonprofit Organizations Not Pay Taxes?
Nonprofit organizations do not pay taxes because they are engaged in public or private interests. The purpose of a nonprofit is to further extend benefit to a community; for this reason, the IRS recognizes and awards these entities tax-exempt as any collected taxes would be used for a similar purpose (i.e. would be redistributed to benefit the community).




Can a Tax-Exempt Organization Make Money?
Yes, tax-exempt organizations such as nonprofits are often encouraged and expected to make money or earn more money than what is spends. For the financial health and longevity of the organization, these entities must build reserves and have excess cash reside in bank accounts. The purpose of being tax-exempt is to have this net profit not be taxed by the IRS.


   The Bottom Line  

A tax-exempt organization is a type of entity that is recognized by the IRS as being exempt from paying federal income taxes on its earnings. To be considered tax-exempt, an organization must meet certain requirements set forth by the IRS and must apply for tax-exempt status. Taxpayers can be exempt from paying certain amounts of ordinary income or capital gains.
What Is Tax-Exempt Interest?  

Tax-exempt interest is interest income that is not subject to federal income tax. In some cases, the amount of tax-exempt interest a taxpayer earns can limit the taxpayer's qualification for certain other tax breaks. The most common sources of tax-exempt interest come from municipal bonds or income-producing assets inside of Roth retirement accounts.





Key Takeaways

Tax-exempt interest refers to interest income that is not subject to taxation, most notably at the federal level.Some municipal bonds may also be "triple-exempt", where tax is not paid at the federal, state, nor local level.Tax-exempt interest may also be earned in Roth retirement accounts as well as some other tax-advantaged products and accounts.


   Tax-Exempt Interest Explained  

Tax-exempt interest can be somewhat of a misnomer as it may still be taxed at the state or local levels. It may also be subject to the alternative minimum tax (AMT).﻿﻿ Furthermore, capital gains on tax-exempt investments are still taxable; only the interest on these investments is tax-exempt.﻿﻿ The most common way to earn interest that is tax-exempt at the state and local levels in addition to the federal level is for an investor to purchase a municipal bond issued in his or her state or locality of residence.﻿﻿



Municipal bonds are one of the most common types of investments that pay tax-exempt interest, but while interest may be tax-exempt at the federal level it may still be taxed at the state level. For example, a California resident who buys a New York municipal bond would pay California income tax on that interest.﻿﻿ These tax laws, however, vary by state. For instance, some states such as Wisconsin and Illinois tax interest earned on most muni bonds, including their own,﻿﻿ ﻿﻿ while states such as California and Arizona exempt interest from taxes if the investor resides in their states.﻿﻿ ﻿﻿ Utah is an example of a state that exempts interest on out-of-state bonds, as long as that state does not impose a tax on bonds issued by Utah.﻿﻿ Treasury securities issued by the U.S. government pay interest that is tax exempt at the state and local levels, but not the federal level.﻿﻿






Triple-tax-exempt is a way of describing an investment, usually a municipal bond, which features interest payments exempt from taxes at the municipal, state and federal levels. 


   State and Local Taxation of Interest  

According to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), interest on a state or local government obligation may be tax-exempt even if the obligation is not a bond. For example, interest on a debt evidenced only by an ordinary written agreement of purchase and sale may be tax-exempt. Also, interest paid by an insurer on default by the state or political subdivision may be tax-exempt.﻿﻿



Mutual funds that hold a mix of stocks and municipal bonds will have the portion of earnings derived from the bonds tax-exempt under federal income tax guidelines and possibly exempt from state taxes depending on the location from which the bonds originated and/or the taxpayer's state of residence.﻿﻿


   Impact on Adjusted Gross Income (AGI)  

Since tax-exempt interest is not subject to income taxes, it is not included in the calculation of adjusted gross income (AGI) for taxation purposes.﻿﻿ Issuers or lenders that pay more than $10 in tax-exempt interest must report the interest income to both taxpayers and the IRS on Form 1099-INT.﻿﻿ Taxpayers or borrowers, in turn, must report this tax-exempt interest on Form 1040.﻿﻿ The amount received as tax-exempt interest is used by the IRS to determine what amount of the taxpayer’s Social Security benefits is taxable.﻿﻿
What Is a Tax Expense?  

tax expense is a liability owed to a federal, state, or local government within a given time period, typically over the course of a year.



Tax expenses are calculated by multiplying the tax rate of the individual or business by the income received or generated before taxes, after factoring in such variables as non-deductible items, tax assets, and tax liabilities.



Tax Expense = Effective Tax Rate x Taxable Income





Key Takeaways

Tax expenses are the total amount of taxes owed by an individual, corporation, or other entity to a taxing authority.Income tax expense is calculated by multiplying taxable income by the effective tax rate.Other taxes may be levied against an asset's value, such as property or estate taxes.


   Understanding Tax Expenses  

Calculating tax expense can be complex given that businesses and individuals are subject to various taxes, each set at a different rate. For instance, a business must pay payroll tax on wages paid to employees, sales tax on certain purchases, and excise tax on certain goods. An individual pays different income tax rates for wages and for their FICA contribution, which goes to Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, and unemployment insurance. (FICA, which is virtually never spelled out, stands for Federal Insurance Contributions Act.)



In addition to the range of tax rates applicable to various levels of income, the different tax rates in different jurisdictions and the multiple layers of tax on income add to the complexity of determining an entity’s tax expense.



In the U.S., determining the appropriate tax rate and identifying the correct accounting methods for items affecting business tax expense are detailed by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and are standardized by Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP).



The GAAP standards provide for a certain treatment of income and expenses which may at times differ from the provisions allowed under the applicable government tax code.



This means that the amount of tax expense recognized is unlikely to exactly match the standard income tax percentage that is applied to business income. In other words, the differences in financial accounting and the tax code may result in a tax expense that differs from the actual tax bill.



For example, many companies use straight-line depreciation to calculate depreciation reported in their financial statements but are allowed to employ an accelerated form of depreciation to derive their taxable profit. The result is a taxable income figure that is lower than the reported income figure.



Tax expense affects a company's net earnings given that it is a liability that must be paid to a federal or state government. The expense reduces the profits to be distributed to shareholders in the form of dividends.



This is even more disadvantageous to shareholders of C corporations who must pay taxes again on the dividend received.



A tax expense is only recognized when a company has taxable income. In the event that a loss is recognized, the business can carry its losses forward to future years to offset or reduce later tax expenses.


   Tax Expense vs. Tax Payable  

The tax expense is the amount of money that a business or other entity has determined is owed in taxes based on standard business accounting rules. This charge is reported on the business' income statement.



The tax payable is the actual amount owed in taxes based on the rules of the tax code. The payable amount is recognized on the balance sheet as a liability until the company settles the tax bill.



If the tax expense is higher than the tax liability, the difference creates another liability, called a deferred tax liability, which must be paid at some point in the future.



On the other hand, if the tax payable is higher than the tax expense, the difference creates an asset category, called the deferred tax asset, which can be used to settle any tax expense in the future.




What Is a Tax Expense for an Individual Taxpayer?
For most individuals, a tax expense is the amount of money owed to the federal government and, for residents of all but nine states, to the state government, in annual income taxes.This tax expense is reported annually in a tax return in which the individual resolves the difference between the amount of taxes already paid and the amount that was owed.The key number in that tax return is the individual's calculation of taxable income, which determines how much tax is owed for the year. Individuals can legally reduce their taxable incomes by deducting some expenses. In recent years, many of those deductions have been abolished and the standard deduction has greatly increased.As a result, nearly 90% of Americans take the standard deduction, greatly reducing the amount of paperwork needed to record and prove their taxable income.




What Is a Tax Expense for a Business?
Arriving at a tax expense is generally a much more complicated and time-consuming matter for businesses than for individuals.A business is taxed on its net income. That is, it deducts the costs of doing business from the amount of revenue it takes in to arrive at its tax expense for the period.Recording business expenses properly for tax purposes requires following rules set by the IRS and standards called GAAP for Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.




What Do My Federal Tax Expenses Include?
Your annual tax return reports your income for the year and the taxes you owe in a number of categories including:Earned income including salary, wages, tips, and commissions.Unearned income such as capital gains on the sale of stock or interest on bonds.The FICA payroll tax, which funds Social Security, Medicaid, Medicare, and unemployment insurance. Like income tax, your estimated FICA tax is deducted from your paycheck at a tax rate of about 7.6%.


   The Bottom Line  

A tax expense is an amount of money that a business or an individual owes to a government body, whether it is federal, state, or local. The term covers all taxes, including capital gains taxes, payroll taxes, and sales taxes as well as income taxes.



Each of these taxes has its own tax rate, which is used to calculate the amount owed. In most cases, this is a simple matter of multiplying the applicable tax rate by the taxable income of the business or individual.



A notable exception, of course, is the sales tax. The amount of sales tax owed is calculated by multiplying the applicable tax rate by the sales price of the goods or services being purchased.
What is Tax Fraud?  

Tax fraud occurs when an individual or business entity willfully and intentionally falsifies information on a tax return to limit the amount of tax liability. Tax fraud essentially entails cheating on a tax return in an attempt to avoid paying the entire tax obligation. Examples of tax fraud include claiming false deductions; claiming personal expenses as business expenses; using a false Social Security number; and not reporting income.



Tax evasion, or illegally avoiding payment of taxes owed, may be construed as an example of tax fraud.





Key Takeaways

Tax fraud costs the government millions of dollars a year. Tax fraud is a different issue than tax avoidance or negligence.Failing to report and pay payroll taxes is an example of business tax fraud. 


   Understanding Tax Fraud  

Tax fraud involves the deliberate misrepresentation or omission of data on a tax return. In the United States, taxpayers are bound by a legal duty to file a tax return voluntarily and to pay the correct amount of income, employment, sales, and excise taxes.



Failure to do so by falsifying or withholding information is against the law and constitutes tax fraud. Tax fraud is investigated by the Internal Revenue Service Criminal Investigation (CI) unit. Tax fraud is said to be evident if the taxpayer is found to have:



Purposely failed to file his income tax returnMisrepresented the actual state of his affairs so as to falsely claim tax deductions or tax creditsIntentionally failed to pay his tax debtPrepared and filed a false returnDeliberately failed to report all income received



A business that engages in tax fraud may:



Knowingly fail to file payroll tax reports
Wittingly fail to report some or all of the cash payments made to employees
Hire an outside payroll service that doesn't turn over funds to the IRS
Fail to withhold federal income tax or FICA (Federal Insurance Contributions) taxes from employee paychecks
Fail to report and pay any withheld payroll taxes


   Tax Fraud vs. Negligence or Avoidance  

For example, claiming an exemption for a nonexistent dependent to reduce tax liability is clearly fraud, while applying the long-term capital gain rate to a short-term earning may be looked into more to determine whether its negligence. Although mistakes attributed to negligence are non-intentional, the IRS may still fine a negligent taxpayer with a penalty of 20 percent of the underpayment. Famous people throughout the world have been guilty of tax fraud, such as Lionel Messi.






Given that the tax code in the U.S. is a complex compilation of tax imposition and laws, a lot of tax preparers are bound to make careless errors.



Tax fraud is not the same as tax avoidance, which is the legal use of loopholes in the tax laws to reduce one’s tax expenses. Although tax avoidance is not a direct violation of the law, it is frowned upon by tax authorities as it may compromise the overall spirit of tax law.


   Special Considerations  

Tax fraud cheats the government out of millions of dollars every year and is punishable by fines, penalties, interest, or prison time. Generally, an entity is not considered to be guilty of tax evasion unless the failure to pay is deemed intentional. Tax fraud does not include mistakes or accidental reporting, which the IRS calls negligent reporting.
What Is Tax Free?  

Tax free refers to certain types of goods and financial securities (such as municipal bonds) that are not taxed. It also refers to earnings that are not taxed. The tax free status of these goods, investments, and income may incentivize individuals and business entities to increase spending or investing, resulting in economic stimulus. Tax free may also be known as tax-exempt.


   Understanding Tax Free  

Tax free purchases and investments do not incur the typical tax consequence of other purchases and investments. For instance, tax free weekends occur in many states where, once or twice a year, store purchases are not taxed, thereby, reducing the overall cost to the consumer. Frequently these sales tax holidays occur before school starts in the Fall to incentivize spending on school supplies, clothes, computers, calculators, etc.



Governments will often provide a tax break to investors purchasing government bonds to ensure that enough funding will be available for expenditure projects. Tax free investments such as tax-exempt municipal bonds (or munis) allow investors to earn interest income tax free. Interest may only be tax free at the federal level if, for example, a California resident buys a New York municipal bond. These tax laws, however, vary by state. For instance, some states such as Wisconsin and Illinois tax interest earned on all muni bonds, including their own, subject to a few exceptions. Meanwhile, states such as California and Arizona exempt interest from taxes only if the investor resides in the issuing state.



For example, assume a local government in California issues a municipal bond to finance a recreational park. An investor, John Smith, who resides in the state of issuance purchases the $5,000 par value bond which matures in two years and has a coupon rate of 3% to be paid annually. At the end of each of the two years, the investor receives interest income of 3% x $5,000 = $150. This income will not be taxed by both the federal and state government. After the bond matures, John Smith will receive his original principal investment back from the local government.



Alaska, Florida, Nevada, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Washington and Wyoming don't have a state-level income tax, so they naturally exempt interest on all muni bonds. Treasury securities issued by the U.S. government, namely the U.S. Savings Bond and Treasury Inflation Protected Securities (TIPSs), pay interest that is tax free at the state and local levels, but not the federal level.



According to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), interest on a state or local government obligation may be tax free even if the obligation is not a bond. For example, interest on a debt evidenced only by an ordinary written agreement of purchase and sale may be tax free. Also, interest paid by an insurer on default by the state or political subdivision may be exempted from tax. Mutual funds that hold a mix of stocks and municipal bonds will have the portion of earnings derived from the bonds tax-exempt under federal income tax guidelines and possibly free from state taxes depending on the location from which the bonds originated and/or the taxpayer's state of residence.



Since tax free interest is not subject to income taxes, it is not included in the calculation of adjusted gross income (AGI) for taxation purposes. Issuers or lenders that pay more than $10 in tax free interest must report the interest income to both taxpayers and the IRS on Form 1099-INT. Taxpayers or borrowers, in turn, must report this tax-exempt interest on Form 1040. The amount received as tax-exempt interest is used by the IRS to determine what amount of the taxpayer's Social Security benefits are taxable.


   Tax Free and the Tax-Equivalent Yield  

The higher an investor’s marginal tax bracket, the more valuable and beneficial tax free securities are for the investor. A tax free investment will carry a tax-equivalent yield that is often higher than the current yield, as determined by the investor's tax bracket. The tax-equivalent yield is the taxable interest rate that would be required to provide the same after-tax interest rate. The tax equivalent yield of a tax-exempt bond can be calculated as:



Tax-Equivalent Yield = Tax-Exempt Yield/(1 – Marginal Tax Rate)



For example, if John Smith in the example above falls in the 35% tax bracket, the 3% muni yield is equivalent to a taxable bond with a yield of:



= 0.03/(1 – 0.35)= 0.03/0.65= 0.046, or 4.6%



What if John Smith was in the 22% tax bracket? The tax-equivalent yield will be:



= 0.03/0.78= 0.038, or 3.8%



The higher your tax rate, the higher the tax-equivalent yield—this shows how tax free securities are best suited to those in higher tax brackets.
What Is a Tax-Free Savings Account?  

A tax-free savings account (TFSA) is a Canadian savings account in which contributions, interest earned, dividends, and capital gains grow tax free. Money withdrawn from it is also tax free.



The money deposited in TFSAs is an after-tax contribution, meaning it's made with money that's already been taxed. Therefore, it doesn't reduce taxable income.



While it's called a savings account, a TFSA can hold investments that include mutual funds, securities, and bonds, as well as cash. This account is available to individuals age 18 and older in Canada and can be used for any purpose.





Key Takeaways

Tax-free savings accounts are a type of tax-advantaged account available to Canadian residents age 18 or older.TFSAs let you save money on taxes because the gains on investments in the account are not taxed and withdrawals are tax free.TFSAs have annual contribution limits called contribution room.Contributions less than the annual limit leave a carryover amount that can be added to the next year's allowed contribution.Carryovers are retroactive back to the year that TFSAs were created, 2009.


   How Tax-Free Savings Accounts Work  

Tax-free savings accounts were introduced in Canada in 2009. They were intended to help Canadians save and invest their money throughout their lives.



The TFSA account lets people save money for any reason, not simply for retirement. For example, you can save for a car, for your education, to buy a home, to set aside extra living expenses, and/or for retirement. What's more, you don't need to have earned income to contribute.



While there are exceptions, the money earned by investments in a TFSA is generally not taxed. Plus, savers maintain control over their TFSAs. They can make contributions, decide on investments, and withdraw funds whenever they wish without penalty.



When first introduced, they offered Canadians age 18 years and older the opportunity to make an after-tax contribution of up to C$5,000 for the year. In 2013, that annual limit was increased to C$5,500 and remained there through 2018, except for 2015, when the limit was increased to C$10,000 temporarily. In 2019, the contribution limit was set at C$6,000 and it remains the same for 2022.


  Contributions  

The maximum amount that you're allowed to deposit to a TFSA is called your "contribution room." Importantly, for every year since 2009 that you were age 18 or older and a resident of Canada, you accumulate contribution room even if you haven't had an account open.



Any unused contribution room can be carried forward. For example, if you contributed the maximum amount each year until 2019, when you contributed only C$3,000 of C$6,000 available contribution room, you could contribute the C$3,000 carryover in 2020. That would have been in addition to the C$6,000 annual contribution limit for 2020 for a total contribution of C$9,000.



Likewise, if you hadn't made any contributions since 2016, your 2020 contribution room for the TFSA account would have been C$23,000: C$5,500 for each of the years 2017 and 2018 (C$11,000) and C$6,000 each for the years 2019 and 2020 (C$12,000).



The TFSA annual room limit is indexed to inflation and rounded to the nearest $500. Also, according to the Canadian Revenue Agency "qualifying transfers, exempt contributions and specified distributions are not considered in the calculation of contribution room."


  Over-Contributions  

Any contribution made to a TFSA beyond the maximum allowable amount is considered an over-contribution. The Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) will charge a tax penalty of 1% per month on the excess contribution until it is withdrawn.



Account holders should be aware that money withdrawn during the year doesn't reduce the amount already contributed. If you contribute additional funds in the mistaken belief that your withdrawal reduced your already-contributed amount, you may over-contribute and, as a result, owe tax on that amount.



Taxes can also be levied for other reasons, including for any contribution made by a non-resident and for prohibited or non-qualified investments acquired by the account.


  TFSA Withdrawals  

Withdrawal amounts open up more contribution room for you, but not in the year of the withdrawal. They are accounted for at the beginning of the following year.



For example, if Jane contributed C$5,500 for the tax year 2020, which had a contribution limit of C$6,000, that left C$500 in contribution room for that year. If she withdrew C$2,000, she wasn't allowed to replace that entire withdrawal amount in the same year because, again, her available contribution room was only C$500.



In this case, Jane can contribute an additional $C500 (the amount allowed by the remaining available contribution room in 2020). Then, at the beginning of 2021, she can add her withdrawal amount from 2020 to her contribution room for 2021.










Carryover Contribution and Withdrawal Calculation Example

$1,500


Total 2022 TFSA contribution room
=
$12,500





   TFSA Contribution Room Amounts  

TFSA contribution room adds up for each year even if you haven't opened a TFSA. Earnings and changes in account value don't affect contribution room.



The annual limits in Canadian dollars since and including 2009 are:



2009-2012: $5,000



2013-2014: $5,500



2015: $10,000



2016-2018: $5,500



2019-2022: $6,000


   Types of Investments Permitted  

According to the Canadian government, the types of investments that are permitted in a TFSA include the following:  



Cash
Mutual funds
Securities listed on a designated stock exchange
Guaranteed investment certificates
Bonds
Certain shares of small business corporations



Check with a financial advisor or investment specialist to be sure that the investments you'd like to purchase align with the options permitted.


   Pros and Cons of TFSAs  
  Pros  

Everything your account earns grows without being diminished by taxes. In addition, all withdrawals are tax free.You don't need earned income to contribute to a TFSA.Unused contribution room carries over to subsequent years, letting you contribute more.Carryover is retroactive back to 2009 or when you became 18 (if after 2009).There are no required withdrawals; take out any amount at any time, without penalty.Government program benefits aren't affected by the income you earn in a TFSA or the amount you withdraw from it.


  Cons  

Contributions aren't tax deductible.Contributions that exceed the contribution room are taxed while they remain in the account.Contributions made while you're a non-resident of Canada are taxed while they remain in the account.If taxes are owed, a TFSA return must be filed by June 30 of the year following the year when the taxable event occurred.TFSA funds aren't protected from creditors.






The income earned by investments in your TFSA doesn't impact your contribution room for current or future years.﻿﻿


   How to Open a TFSA  

Any person who is a resident of Canada, is age 18 or older, and has a valid Social Insurance number is eligible to open a TFSA.* Also, you can have more than one TFSA at any given time, but the total amount you contribute to all your TFSAs cannot be more than your available TFSA contribution room for that year.



To start saving with a TFSA:



Look for financial institutions that offer TFSAs (types include deposit, annuity, trust arrangement, and self-directed TFSA).
Apply for an account. You'll need to provide your Social Insurance number, date of birth, and valid identification.
Once your account is approved and open, the financial institution will register the account as a qualifying arrangement with the Canadian Revenue Agency.
Start funding your TFSA.



*You may open a TFSA if you're not a Canadian resident but any contribution made while still a non-resident will be taxed at 1% per month until removed from the account.


   TFSAs vs. RRSPs  

While a registered retirement savings plan (RRSP) account is specifically for retirement savings, a TFSA can be used to save for anything. The tax-free savings account differs from a registered retirement account in two other main ways:



Deposits made to an RRSP are deducted from your taxable income. Deposits into a TFSA are not tax-deductible.
Withdrawals from a retirement plan are taxed as income. Withdrawals from a TFSA are not taxed.




How Does the Tax Advantage of a TFSA Compare to a Regular Investment Account?
Take two savers, Joe and Jane. At the beginning of the year, Joe puts C$6,000 in an investment account earning 7% per year. Jane contributes the same amount, but to a TFSA earning 7%. They will each have C$6,420 after a year, but Jane can withdraw all C$6,420 and owe no taxes on it, whereas Joe would be taxed on the earnings of C$420.




Are Contributions to a TFSA Tax Deductible?
No. You make contributions with money that's already been taxed. Therefore, they aren't deductible up front and can't reduce your taxable income. However, with few exceptions, all withdrawals from a TFSA are completely tax free.




What Is the Early Withdrawal Penalty for TFSAs?
There is no penalty for any withdrawal from a TFSA. That's one of its advantages. The Canadian government intended for this type of savings account to be used for any purpose whatsoever, and not simply for retirement. So, you can take withdrawals at any time during your life without being penalized for doing so.


   The Bottom Line  

Tax-Free Savings Accounts provide a terrific opportunity to save and invest for any purpose you choose. Account balances grow tax free. Withdrawals are tax free, as well. Plus, you can take withdrawals any time you wish to.



TFSAs also allow account holders to carry over unused portions of their contribution room to subsequent years. Plus, withdrawal amounts can be added back to the account in the following year. This adds to the allowed contribution amount, giving a saver even more opportunity to build the value of their account throughout their lives.
What Is a Tax Haven?  

A tax haven is a country that offers foreign businesses and individuals minimal or no tax liability for their bank deposits in a politically and economically stable environment. They have tax advantages for corporations and for the very wealthy, and obvious potential for misuse in illegal tax avoidance schemes.



Companies and wealthy individuals may use tax havens legally as a means of stashing money earned abroad while avoiding higher taxes in the U.S. and other nations.



Tax havens may also be used illegally to hide money from tax authorities at home. The tax haven can make this work by being uncooperative with foreign tax authorities. In recent times, tax havens are under increasing international political pressure to cooperate with foreign tax fraud inquiries.





Key Takeaways

Tax havens encourage foreign depositors by offering tax advantages to corporations and the wealthy.Many have secrecy laws that block information on their deposits from foreign tax authorities.Depositing money in a tax haven is legal as long as the depositor pays the taxes required by the home jurisdiction.


   Understanding Tax Havens  

Broadly speaking, tax havens are jurisdictions that have very low taxes and no residency requirements for foreign entities and individuals willing to park money in their financial institutions.



A combination of lax regulation and secrecy laws enable corporations and individuals to screen some of their income from tax authorities in other nations.



The Tax Justice Network maintains a Corporate Tax Haven Index that tracks the jurisdictions that it says are "most complicit" in helping multinational corporations evade taxes. As of 2021, the worst offenders were the British Virgin Islands, the Cayman Islands, and Bermuda.



Tax havens may be found in another country or merely in a separate jurisdiction:


  Intranational Tax Havens  

Some U.S. states have no income tax. That simple fact makes them attractive to corporations looking to pay less overall in taxes, although it doesn't help them avoid federal taxes.



For example, in the United States, Alaska, Florida, Nevada, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Washington, and Wyoming require no state income tax.



Delaware is the state of choice for corporate incorporation. It does not impose a corporate tax on corporations that incorporate in Delaware but do business elsewhere.


  Offshore Tax Havens  

From the viewpoint of an American, "offshore" is anywhere outside U.S. jurisdiction.



Offshore tax havens benefit from the capital their countries draw into their economies. The funds flow in from individuals and businesses with accounts at banks and other financial institutions.



Individuals and corporations benefit from low or no taxes charged on income in foreign countries where loopholes, credits, or other special tax considerations may be allowed.



Characteristics of tax haven countries generally include no or low taxes, minimal reporting of information, lack of transparency obligations, lack of local presence requirements, and marketing of tax haven vehicles.






Worldwide there is not a comprehensively defined standard for the classification of a tax haven country, but several regulatory bodies monitor tax haven countries, including the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and the U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO).


   U.S. Government Response to Tax Havens  

The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA), which passed in December 2017, set the effective corporate rate of U.S. taxes at 21%. It also added provisions intended to discourage foreign investments.



Systematically, the TCJA is known for being more territorial in nature than previous international tax laws. The international tax system under the TCJA exempts foreign profits from domestic taxation but has certain provisions for high return foreign profits.



Some companies that have historically been known for offshore tax haven holdings include Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, Cisco, and Oracle. Overall, tax havens may also offer advantages in the area of credit, since it may be less expensive for U.S.-based companies to borrow funds internationally. This type of lending, which can potentially fund acquisitions and other corporate activities, is also subject to reporting within the guidelines of U.S. tax law, generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), and guidelines under International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS).


  Individual U.S. Taxpayers  

The U.S. has special rules in place for the reporting of foreign income by U.S. citizens and non-U.S. citizens. These rules are generally governed under the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA).



FATCA requires the filing of a Schedule B and/or Form 8938, which provides disclosure of foreign account holdings when investments exceed $50,000. Separately, foreign account holders may also be required to file Form 114, Report of Foreign Bank and Financial Accounts.



In general, there can potentially be exemptions and foreign tax credits for investment in all types of overseas vehicles but it is important to consult a tax advisor for individual situations to ensure proper reporting.


   Regulatory Oversight of Tax Havens  

Tax havens create opportunities for illegal activities that go well beyond tax evasion. They are popular stops in the elaborate process of money laundering, which involves transferring illegally obtained cash through a series of shell companies until it can't be traced.



As such, there is some regulatory oversight of tax havens.



To maximize tax receipts, many foreign governments maintain relatively constant pressure on tax havens to release information regarding offshore investment accounts. However, because of the monetary burdens, regulatory oversight may not always be a top national priority.



Worldwide, some programs are in place to increase the enforcement of offshore investment reporting. The Automatic Exchange of Financial Information is one example, overseen by the Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD).



The program requires participating countries to automatically transmit tax-related banking information of non-citizen depositors to the countries in which they are citizens.



Sometimes it takes a crisis to force change. For example, Cyprus’s financial sector, built on the country’s tax haven status, collapsed in 2013. The European Commission, European Central Bank, and the International Monetary Fund predicated an $11.8 billion bailout on the country's agreement to comply with more robust tax participation. 




What Are the Top 10 Overseas Tax Havens?
The top tax havens currently are the British Virgin Islands, Cayman Islands, Bermuda, The Netherlands, Switzerland, Luxembourg, Hong Kong, the Cayman Islands, Jersey, Singapore, and the United Arab Emirates.




Which U.S. Companies Use Tax Havens the Most?
Apple, Nike, and Goldman Sachs may have the most cash stashed abroad as of this writing. Apple alone has almost $215 billion banked in Ireland.Other big businesses with offshore accounts include Microsoft, IBM, General Electric, Pfizer, ExxonMobile, Chevron, and Walmart.




What Are the Advantages of a Tax Haven?
Corporations and wealthy individuals benefit primarily from low or no taxes on their income in foreign countries where loopholes, credits, or other special tax considerations may be lawful.Tax havens may also offer advantages in the area of credit, since it may be less expensive for U.S.-based companies to borrow funds internationally. Also, they are discreet. They share limited or no financial information with foreign tax authorities. 




How Does a Nation Benefit From Being a Tax Haven?
The tax havens benefit when their financial institutions bring in a vast amount of money. That money is then invested for profit.Plus, even the very low fees charged for offshore accounts add up nicely. It is estimated that U.S. companies have somewhere between $24 trillion to $36 trillion tucked away in tax havens around the globe.
What Is a Tax Holiday?  

A tax holiday is a temporary tax break. In the United States, tax holidays often suspend state and local sales taxes paid by consumers. Governments also use tax holidays as investment incentives that may exempt a new plant from property taxes for a number of years, for example.





Key Takeaways

A tax holiday is a governmental incentive that temporarily reduces or eliminates taxes for consumers or businesses.The objective of a tax holiday is to encourage economic activity and foster growth.Tax holidays may also be offered to businesses as an investment incentive.There is ongoing debate about whether the benefits of tax holidays justify their costs.Some states that have offered sales tax holidays in the recent past have canceled them amid political opposition.


   How a Tax Holiday Works  

When a government wants to encourage consumer spending or business investment it may offer a tax holiday—a temporary period during which certain taxes are reduced or lifted altogether.



Tax holidays may also seek to offset the effect of market-based increases in prices, as in the case of gas tax holidays instituted by some states and advocated by President Joseph Biden in 2022 in response to sharply higher prices at the pump.



Some tax holidays have become an annual tradition. For example, some state and local governments in the United States offer a sales tax holiday the weekend before school resumes in the fall to reduce parents' outlays for school supplies. The goal is to increase store traffic, which can boost overall spending. States declaring a tax holiday may also hope to draw consumers from other nearby states.



Researchers found that sales tax holidays lead households to increase purchases of clothing and shoes by more than 49% and 45% respectively.



National or local governments may also offer a tax holiday for businesses to foster growth. Developing countries sometimes use tax holidays to attract foreign investment.



Tax holidays focused on business investment may be defined based on the location of the investment, as in the case of Opportunity Zones created by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, which defer capital gains taxes on funds reinvested in qualifying projects within designated low-income areas.



Alternatively, business investment tax holidays may target particular companies or industries. For example, the state of Wisconsin initially offered $2.85 billion in tax credits to Taiwan electronics manufacturer Foxconn, only to scale that back to $80 million when Foxconn failed to follow through on plans to invest $10 billion in a new plant in the state.


   Are Tax Holidays Effective?  

The net benefit of tax holidays is still up for debate. On the one hand, even though the government loses out on tax revenues that would have been generated from sales during the tax holiday, such tax breaks may increase revenue over the long term because they stimulate spending and investment. In addition, the lost tax revenue may be offset by consumers' increased purchases of items in product categories that are not affected by the tax holiday.



On the other hand, increased sales during a tax holiday may be preceded by reduced sales before the holiday because consumers know they'll save money by waiting. Thus, the tax holiday simply shifts sales that would have happened before or after the holiday to the holiday dates.



One study found that a weekend-long broad sales tax holiday in Massachusetts increased spending in the state over the entire month and relative to that in neighboring states.



Some retailers may take advantage of tax holidays by raising their prices, effectively pocketing some of the subsidy intended for consumers. Perhaps not coincidentally, retailers groups have been among the strongest advocates of sales tax holidays, while lawmakers in several of the states that have offered them in the recent past have grown more skeptical of the concept.




How Much Can You Save During a Tax Holiday?
How much money you can save during a tax holiday depends largely on the customary sales taxes in the state or locality where you're shopping. A few states, such as Delaware and Oregon, have no state sales tax at all. Others including California and Rhode Island charge 7% or more. When local sales taxes are added, total sales taxes in some areas can top 9%.




What Kinds of Products Can You Save on During a Tax Holiday?
The most common items subject to tax holidays in the U.S. include clothing, footwear, school supplies, and computers. Some states single out other products such as firearms and ammunition (Mississippi), generators and air conditioners (Texas), or sports equipment (West Virginia).




How Long Do Tax Holidays Last?
State tax holidays generally last from two to seven days, according to a list compiled by the Federation of Tax Administrators.


   The Bottom Line  

Tax policy can certainly affect consumption and investment. The notion that a sales tax break on some or all consumer goods for a few days in a year could permanently increase sales and prosperity has been a harder sell, despite its obvious attractions for retailers, shoppers, and politicians. Business investment tax breaks invite neighboring jurisdictions to offer incentives of their own in a beggar-thy-neighbor race to the bottom, while risking sweetheart deals for favored businesses from friendly politicians. A tax holiday may provide a temporary economic boost but it is not the proverbial free lunch.
What Is a Tax Identification Number (TIN)?  

A Tax Identification Number (TIN) is a nine-digit number used as a tracking number by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). It is required information on all tax returns filed with the IRS. All U.S. tax identification numbers (TIN) or tax I.D. numbers are issued directly by the IRS except Social Security numbers (SSNs), which are issued by the Social Security Administration (SSA).   Foreign tax identifying numbers (foreign TIN) are also not issued by the IRS; rather, they are issued by the country in which the non-U.S. taxpayer pays taxes.

Key Takeaways

Tax identification numbers are nine-digit tracking numbers used by the IRS following tax laws.The IRS issues all U.S. tax I.D. numbers except for social security numbers, which are issued by the Social Security Administration.Tax filers must include their tax identification number on tax-related documents and when claiming benefits.TINs are also required when applying for credit and employment. There are different types of tax identification numbers, such as the employer identification number, individual tax identification number, and adoption tax identification number.


   Understanding the Tax Identification Number (TIN)  

A tax identification number is a unique set of numbers that identifies individuals, corporations, and other entities such as nonprofit organizations (NPOs). Each person or entity must apply for a TIN. Once approved, the assigning agency assigns the applicant a special number.



The TIN, which is also called a taxpayer identification number, is mandatory for anyone filing annual tax returns with the IRS, which the agency uses to track taxpayers. Filers must include the number on tax-related documents and when claiming benefits or services from the government.



TINs are also required for other purposes:



For credit: Banks and other lenders require Social Security numbers on applications for credit. This information is then relayed to the credit bureaus to ensure the right person is filling out the application. The credit reporting agencies also use TINs—notably SSNs—to report and track an individual's credit history.
For employment: Employers require an SSN from anyone applying for employment. This is to ensure that the individual is authorized to work in the United States. Employers verify the numbers with the issuing agency.
For state agencies: Businesses also require state identification numbers for tax purposes in order to file with their state tax agencies. State taxing authorities issue the I.D. number directly to the filer.



Tax identification numbers or taxpayer-identification numbers come in several different forms. Individuals are assigned TINs in the form of Social Security numbers (SSNs), whereas businesses (e.g., corporations and partnerships) are assigned employer identification numbers (EINs). Other types of TINs include the Individual Taxpayer Identification Number (ITIN), the Adoption Taxpayer Identification Number (ATIN), and the Preparer Tax Identification Number (PTIN). More information about these types is noted below.


   Special Considerations  

Almost every country uses TINs for various reasons. For instance, Canada uses Social Insurance Numbers (SINs) for employment, tax, benefits, and credit purposes.   Just like the SSN in the U.S., the SIN is a nine-digit unique identifier that is formatted as XXX-XXX-XXX.



Countries in the European Union also use TINs. They help government agencies identify taxpayers and allow entities to invest their money across the Union.  


   Types of Tax Identification Numbers (TIN)  
  Social Security Number (SSN)  

The social security number (SSN) is the most common tax identification number. SSNs are issued to individuals—U.S. citizens, permanent residents, and certain temporary residents—by the Social Security Administration. These numbers are formatted as XXX-XX-XXXX.



The SSN is required to secure legal employment in the U.S. and to receive social security benefits and other government services. A child must have an SSN before a parent can claim them as a dependent for income tax purposes, which means parents voluntarily apply for the number on behalf of their children. A child with an ITIN can be claimed as a dependent. The SSA processes applications for free, but there are also fee-based services that offer to complete applications for new parents.






Your Social Security number is a unique identifier that can be misused by fraudsters, so make sure you only release it to those you are required to, including the IRS, employers, and lenders.


  Individual Taxpayer Identification Number (ITIN)  

The IRS issues the Individual Taxpayer Identification Number (ITIN) to certain nonresident and resident aliens, their spouses, and their dependents when ineligible for SSNs. Arranged in the same format as an SSN (XXX-XX-XXXX), the ITIN begins with a 9. To get an individual tax id number, the applicant must complete Form W-7 and submit documents supporting his or her resident status. Certain agencies—including colleges, banks, and accounting firms—often help applicants obtain their ITIN.


  Employer Identification Number (EIN)  

The IRS uses the Employee Identification Number (EIN) to identify corporations, trusts, and estates that must pay taxes. Just like SSNs, employer tax ID numbers are also nine digits long, but they are read as XX-XXXXXXX. Those who qualify for an EIN must apply for the number and use it to report their capital gains and income for taxation purposes. Applying for an EIN is free, and businesses can obtain one immediately.  


  Adoption Tax Identification Number (ATIN)  

The ATIN only applies to domestic adoptions when the adoptive parents cannot obtain the child's SSN to complete their tax returns promptly. To qualify, the child must be a U.S. citizen or permanent resident and the adoption must be pending.


  Preparer Tax Identification Number (PTIN)  

As of Jan. 1, 2011, the IRS required the listing of a PTIN on each return filed. Before this date, the use of the PTIN was optional. Any preparer that charges to complete all or part of the tax return for another individual must have and use the PTIN.




How Can I Get a TIN?
You can get a tax identification number by applying directly to the correct agency. For instance, you can get a Social Security number through the Social Security Administration. If you need an Individual Taxpayer Identification number or one for a business, you may be able to obtain one directly from the Internal Revenue Service.




How Do I Know If I Need a TIN?
You need a TIN if you are authorized to work in the United States or if you plan to file taxes with the IRS. You'll also need a TIN if you want to take advantage of benefits or services offered by the government. If you run a business or other organization, you'll also need a TIN to run your day-to-day operations and to report your taxes.




How Can I Find My TIN Online?
The agency that issues your TIN provides you with an official document with your unique identifier. Because it is a sensitive piece of information, you can't go online to retrieve it. If you can't remember or lose your documents, you should contact the issuing agency, such as the SSA, to get your TIN again.




Is a TIN the Same as a Tax I.D.?
A TIN is the same as a tax I.D. as it stands for tax identification number or taxpayer-identification number.




Is a TIN the Same as a Social Security Number?
A Social Security number is an example of a TIN. It allows you to seek employment in the United States, to obtain credit with banks and other lenders, and you can file your annual tax returns with the IRS using your SSN.
What Is a Tax Incidence?  

"Tax incidence" (or incidence of tax) is an economic term for understanding the division of a tax burden between stakeholders, such as buyers and sellers or producers and consumers. Tax incidence can also be related to the price elasticity of supply and demand. When supply is more elastic than demand, the tax burden falls on the buyers. If demand is more elastic than supply, producers will bear the cost of the tax.





Key Takeaways

A tax incidence describes a case when buyers and sellers divide a tax burden.A tax incidence will also lay out who bears the burden of a new tax, for instance among producers and consumers, or among various class segments of a population.The elasticity of demand of a good can help understand the tax incidence among parties.


   How a Tax Incidence Works  

The tax incidence depicts the distribution of the tax obligations, which must be covered by the buyer and seller. The level at which each party participates in covering the obligation shifts based on the associated price elasticity of the product or service in question as well as how the product or service is currently affected by the principles of supply and demand.



Tax incidence reveals which group—consumers or producers—will pay the price of a new tax. For example, the demand for prescription drugs is relatively inelastic. Despite changes in cost, its market will remain relatively constant.


   Levying New Taxes on Inelastic and Elastic Goods  

Another example is that the demand for cigarettes is mostly inelastic. When governments impose a cigarette tax, producers increase the sale price by the full amount of the tax, transferring the tax burden to consumers. Through analysis, it is found the demand for cigarettes is unaffected by price. Of course, there are limits to this theory. If a pack of cigarettes suddenly increased from $5 to $1,000, consumer demand would fall.



If the levying of new taxes on an elastic good, such as fine jewelry, occurs, most of the burden would likely shift to the producer as an increase in price may have a significant impact on the demand for the associated goods. Elastic goods are goods with close substitutes or that are nonessential.


   Price Elasticity and Tax Incidence  

Price elasticity is a representation of how buyer activity changes in response to movements in the price of a good or service. In situations where the buyer is likely to continue purchasing a good or service regardless of a price change, the demand is said to be inelastic. When the price of the good or service profoundly impacts the level of demand, the demand is considered highly elastic.



Examples of inelastic goods or services can include gasoline and prescription medicines. The level of consumption across the economy remains steady with price changes. Elastic products are those whose demand is significantly affected by price. This group of products includes luxury goods, houses, and clothing.



The formula for determining the consumer's tax burden with "E" representing elasticity is as follows:



E (supply) / (E (demand)) + E (supply)



The formula for determining the producer or supplier's tax burden with "E" representing elasticity is as follows:



E (demand) / (E (demand) + E (supply))




What Does Tax Incidence Determine?
Tax incidence shows who or what ultimately bears the burden of a tax, as opposed to just who directly pays the tax.




Are Consumers or Retailers Impacted More By Tax Incidence?
A number of different parties can be impacted by tax incidence, such as when a consumer has to pay higher sales taxes, and therefore spends less at a retailer, ultimately hurting the retailer's sales and leading to job cuts or store closings.




What Is Elastic Vs. Inelastic Demand?
Elastic demand is demand that rises or falls based on the price of the service or product, state of the economy, or financial health of the person. Inelastic demand is demand that is, to an extent, impervious to price fluctuations, the state of the economy, tax incidence or any other financial consideration. It is the difference between something like entertainment or self-care purchases versus food and medicine.
What Is Tax Liability?  

Tax liability is the payment owed by an individual, business, or other entity to a federal, state, or local tax authority.



Generally, you have a tax liability when you earn income or generate profits by selling an investment or other asset. It is possible to have no income tax liability if you don't meet the income requirements to file taxes.





Key Takeaways

Tax liability is the total amount of tax debt owed to a government by an individual, corporation, or other entity.Income taxes, sales tax, and capital gains tax are all forms of tax liabilities.Taxes are imposed by various taxing authorities, including federal, state, and local governments. Taxes generate the funds to pay for services such as repairing roads and maintaining a military.You can lower your tax liabilities by claiming deductions, exemptions, and tax credits.

   Understanding Tax Liability  

Various authorities, including federal, state, and local governments, impose taxes and use the funds to pay for services such as repairing roads, funding social programs, and maintaining a military.



Companies withhold income, Social Security, and Medicare taxes from employees' wages and send them to the federal government.



It's important to note that your tax liability doesn't just include the current year. Instead, it factors in any years for which taxes are owed. That means that if back taxes (any unpaid taxes from previous years) are due, those are also added to your tax liability.


   How to Calculate Your Tax Liability  

The most common tax liability for Americans is the tax on earned income. For federal taxes, you use the tax brackets and standard deductions issued by the Internal Revenue Service.



Standard deductions for 2022 are:



$12,950 for single filers$12,950 for married couples filing separately$19,400 for heads of households$25,900 for married couples filing jointly



Standard deductions for 2023 are:

Imagine you're a single filer in 2022, earning $72,950 per year. After applying your standard deduction of $12,950, your reportable income is $60,000. You also have no other deductions or income. Because your adjusted gross income is between $41,775 and $89,075, you fall into the 22% tax bracket. Your tax liability is computed for each tax bracket up to the one you're in. Here's how it works:



Your first $10,275 is taxed at 10%, so you owe $10,275 x 10% = $1,028The amount over $10,275 but under $41,775 is taxed at 12%, so you owe $31,500 x 12% = $3,780The amount over $41,775 but under $89,075 is taxed at 22%, so you owe $18,225 x 22% = $4,010You total up each amount you owe per bracket $1,028 + $3,780 + $4,010 = $8,818Your total tax liability is $8,818 plus back taxes, if any


  Liability or Refund?  

Now assume that your W-4 resulted in your employer withholding $7,500 in federal taxes. When you file your individual tax return (Form 1040), you haven't met your tax liability so you owe taxes. In this case, you'd owe $8,818 - $7,500 = $1,318.



If your W-4 resulted in your employer withholding $9,200 in federal taxes, the IRS would refund you $9,200 - $8,818 = $382.






To calculate your state tax liability, locate your state's standard deductions and tax information and use the instructions provided by the state. Some states have a single tax rate, and others have graduated brackets.


   How Capital Gains Are Taxed  

When you sell an investment, real estate, or any other asset for a gain, you owe taxes on the gain. If you sell it for a loss, you can report it as a capital loss. Capital gains are taxed in two different ways: long-term capital gain and short-term capital gain. If you've held an asset for one year or less and sold it for a gain, it is a short-term capital gain included in your income.



If you hold an asset for more than one year and sell it for a gain, it is considered a long-term capital gain and is subject to the capital gains tax. There are capital gains thresholds, similar to income tax brackets.

Here is how it works: assume you purchase 100 shares of XYZ common stock for $10,000 in 2022 and sell them five years later for $18,000. The $8,000 gain is a taxable event. Because you held the stock for more than one year, the gain is a long-term capital gain.



Using the previous example, if your adjusted gross income was $60,000, your capital gains bracket is 15%. So, you'd need to pay 15% of $8,000 in taxes, or $1,200. If you had held the stocks for less than one year, you'd include the $8,000 in your gross income before subtracting your standard deduction.



So, if you earned $72,950 and had $8,000 in short-term capital gains, your total income is $80,950. If your filing status and other deductions were the same as in the previous example, you'd still be in the 22% tax bracket and would work through the calculations the same way with the new income amount.


   How to Reduce Your Tax Liability  

Taxes can take a significant bite out of your take-home pay, but it's something everyone has to live with to fund the government programs we rely on; however, there are a few ways to reduce the amount of taxes you pay.


  Deductions and Credits  

You might qualify for other deductions or credits. Deductions reduce your taxable income, and credits reduce the amount of tax you owe. Some deductions you might be able to take are:



Business expensesUsing your car for business purposesUsing your home for business purposesItemized deductionsEducation deductionsHealthcare deductionsInvestment deductions



Some credits are:



Family and dependent creditsIncome and savings creditsHomeowner creditsHealthcare creditsEducation credits


  Contribute to a Retirement Fund  

Contributing to a retirement fund does more than help you save for and grow your retirement nest egg—if carefully planned, you can reduce your tax liability for years to come. You can contribute a specific amount per year to your IRA, which is tax-deferred. You contribute to a Roth IRA after you've paid taxes.



To lower your tax liability by contributing, you'll only need to determine how much you plan to be taxed in retirement by projecting your income and withdrawals. If you're in a higher tax bracket now than you will be in retirement, a traditional IRA can lower your total tax payments because:



Taxes are deferredYou'll be in a lower bracket with less tax liability later



If you're sure you'll be in a higher tax bracket after you retire and begin taking withdrawals, a Roth IRA can lower your total tax payments because withdrawals are tax-free.




How Is Tax Liability Determined?
You determine your tax liability by subtracting your standard deduction from your taxable income and referring to the appropriate IRS tax brackets.




How Do I Know If I Have No Tax Liability?
You have no tax liability if you aren't required to file income taxes or have no taxable income for the tax year.




How Do I Reduce My Tax Liability?
Some ways to reduce your tax liability include contributing to a retirement or health savings account. You can also use credits or other deductions to reduce your taxable income.


   The Bottom Line  

Tax liability is the amount of taxes you owe on your taxable income for the year. If you earn income, you'll have a tax liability.



To determine your tax liability, you add all your income and subtract your standard deduction to figure out your taxable income. Then, refer to the IRS tax brackets to find your tax liability.
What Is a Tax Lien?  

A tax lien is a legal claim against the assets of an individual or business that fails to pay taxes owed to the government. In general, a lien serves to guarantee payment of a debt such as a loan, or in this case, taxes. If the obligation is not satisfied, the creditor may proceed to seize the assets.





Key Takeaways

If a taxpayer does not respond to a demand for payment, the government may place a lien on the person's assets.The lien may be removed if the taxpayer agrees to a payment plan or takes other action with the agreement of the government.If no attempt to repay is made, the government may seize the assets for sale.


   Understanding a Tax Lien  

The federal or state government can place a tax lien on a property if the owner is in arrears on income taxes. Local governments may place a lien on a property for nonpayment of property or local income taxes.



The lien does not mean that the property will be sold. Rather, it ensures that the tax authority gets the first claim over any other creditors vying for the creditor's assets.


   The Process of a Tax Lien  

The process begins when a taxpayer gets a letter that details how much is owed. This is known as a notice and demand for payment.



If the taxpayer fails to pay the debt or attempt to resolve it with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), the agency can place a lien on the person's assets.



This lien attaches to all of a taxpayer’s assets, including securities, property, and vehicles. Any assets the taxpayer acquires while the lien is in effect also apply. It also attaches to any business property and the accounts receivable for the business.



If the taxpayer chooses to file for bankruptcy, the lien and the tax debt could continue even after the bankruptcy. Most debts are wiped out by bankruptcy proceedings, but not federal tax debt. 


   What the IRS Can Do  

In the U.S., the IRS may place a lien against a taxpayer's home, vehicle, and bank accounts if federal tax payments are delinquent and there has been no demonstrated effort to pay the taxes owed.



A federal tax lien has precedence over all other creditors' claims. It also makes it difficult for the taxpayer to sell the assets or to obtain credit.



The only way to release a federal tax lien is to fully pay the tax owed or reach a settlement with the IRS.



Once a lien has been filed, it used to show up on the taxpayer's credit report, damaging the person's credit score. This could also prevent the taxpayer from selling or refinancing any assets to which liens have been attached. Note that since 2018, the three major credit reporting agencies have stopped including tax liens on credit reports.



The lien will remain in place until the tax bill is resolved or the statute of limitations on the debt expires.



The IRS has the authority to seize the assets of a taxpayer who ignores a tax lien.


   Getting out of a Tax Lien  

The simplest way to get out of a federal tax lien is to pay the taxes owed. However, if this is not possible, there are other ways to deal with a lien with the cooperation of the IRS.



The IRS will consider releasing a tax lien if the taxpayer agrees to a payment plan with an automatic withdrawal monthly until the debt is satisfied.
The taxpayer may be able to discharge a specific property, effectively removing it from the lien. Not all taxpayers or properties are eligible for discharge. IRS Publication 783 details regulations about discharging property.
Subordination does not actually remove the lien from any property but it sometimes makes it easier for the taxpayer to obtain another mortgage or loan. IRS Form 14134 is used to apply for such action.
Yet another process, withdrawal of notice, removes the public notice of a federal tax lien. The taxpayer is still liable for the debt, but under withdrawal, the IRS does not compete with any other creditors for the debtor’s property. Form 12277 is the application.



If repaying the taxes is simply impossible, the taxpayer must pay as much of the debt as possible and seek dismissal of the balance in bankruptcy court.


   What Happens Next  

If the taxes remain unpaid, the tax authority can use a tax levy to legally seize the taxpayer's assets in order to collect the money it is owed.



While a lien secures the government’s interest or claim in the property, a levy permits the government to seize and sell the property in order to pay the tax debt.


   Once It's Over  

Tax liens are publicly recorded. After a tax debtor pays off the debt, the county records will be updated to reflect the fact that the lien has been released.
What Is a Tax Lien Certificate?  

A tax lien certificate is a certificate of claim against a property that has a lien placed upon it as a result of unpaid property taxes. Tax lien certificates are generally sold to investors through an auction process.





Key Takeaways

Tax lien certificates are documents that represent a legal claim against a property with unpaid property taxes.The local government may place a lien on a property when taxes are in default.The local government may choose to sell the tax lien certificate to an investor; in this manner, the government is able to receive funds as originally intended.An investor that receives a tax lien certificates collects a legal claim against the property for the amount paid. The investor may receive funds back if property taxes are eventually paid; they often receive revenue via a penalty charged as an interest rate to the defaulter. 


   Understanding Tax Lien Certificates  

A tax lien certificate is a lien placed on your property for not paying your taxes. Every time your property taxes come due, the municipality will issue a tax lien. When you pay your taxes on time, the lien is removed. If you don't pay your taxes—or don't pay them on time—the town or county will auction off the tax lien certificate to an investor(s). That investor will then pay the taxes on behalf of the property tax owner. 



After an investor places a winning bid for a specific tax lien certificate, a lien is placed on the property, and a certificate is issued to the investor detailing the outstanding taxes and penalties on the property. Not all states, counties or municipalities offer tax liens. Some states, such as California, only perform tax sales on a defaulted property, resulting in the winning bidder becoming the legal owner of the property in question.



The term of tax lien certificates typically ranges from one to three years. The certificate enables the investor to collect unpaid taxes plus the applicable prevailing rate of interest, which can range from 8 to more than 30 percent, depending on the jurisdiction.






Tax lien certificates may be bid based on highest cash amount, lowest interest rate, or other method.


   How Tax Lien Certificates are Sold  

The sale of a tax lien certificate starts when the local government sends out tax bills to property owners for the amount owed on their property taxes. If the property owner fails to pay the taxes on time, the local government places a tax lien on the property. This lien is then placed in an auction and is typically held online or in-person. Bidders usually have to register and provide a deposit before participating.



At the auction, investors bid on the tax lien certificates by offering to pay the unpaid taxes plus any interest and fees. The winning bidder receives a certificate that represents a lien on the property for the amount they paid. The property owner then has a set period of time to redeem the tax lien certificate by paying the investor the amount owed plus interest and fees. If the owner fails to redeem the certificate, the investor may be able to foreclose on the property and take ownership.



For a property to be eligible, it must be considered tax-defaulted for a minimum period depending on local regulation. Instead of bidding on an amount for the property, the interested parties bid on the interest rate they are willing to receive. The investor who bids the lowest rate wins the auction and is issued the tax lien certificate.


   Rate of Return on Tax Lien Certificates  

Spurred by the high state-mandated rates of interest, tax lien certificates may offer rates of return that are substantially higher than those offered by other investments. Tax liens generally have precedence over other liens, such as mortgages. If the property owner fails to pay the back taxes, the investor could potentially acquire the property for pennies on the dollar. Acquiring a property in that manner is a rare occurrence since most tax liens are redeemed well before the property goes to foreclosure.



In some states, the interest rate is fixed by law. It's also important to note that the rate of return on tax lien certificates is not guaranteed and can vary depending on whether the property owner redeems the certificate, whether the investor is able to foreclose on the property, and other factors. Like other forms of investment, investment returns are often a function of risk.






Be mindful of your local municipality's property tax deadlines. Chances are after that deadline, the entity will issue more tax lien certificates.


   Associated Benefits and Risks of Tax Lien Certificates  

Buying a tax lien certificate can, at times, prove to be an attractive investment. Some of the certificates have a low entry point, meaning you can buy some of them for a few hundred dollars. Compare that to a traditional investment like a mutual fund, which often comes with a minimum investment requirement. You also have the option to spread your money around so that you can buy multiple certificates for a low dollar value. And finally, the rate of return (as we mentioned above) is usually pretty consistent, so you're not going to have to worry about the ups and downs of the market. 



Negative aspects of tax lien certificates include the requirement for the investor to pay for the tax lien certificate in full within a very short period, usually one to three days. These certificates are also highly illiquid since there is no secondary trading market for them. Investors in tax lien certificates also have to undertake significant due diligence and research to ensure that the underlying properties have an appropriate assessed value.



An example regarding the need for due diligence when researching tax lien certificates is a two-acre lot that may initially seem to be a good value, but it's actually a strip of land that is only 3 feet wide by 5 miles long. This renders the land unusable for many endeavors, such as building a home or a business.


   Tax Implications of Tax Lien Certificates  

The tax implications of tax lien certificates depend on several factors. There may be taxed imposed at the Federal, state, or local levels depending on the circumstances of the certificate.



If an investor earns interest on a tax lien certificate, that income may be subject to taxes. The interest income is typically reported on the investor's tax return in the year it is earned; even if the investor did not receive any cash distributions, the taxpayer must report the interest income as taxable income. If the property owner redeems the tax lien certificate by paying the unpaid taxes and any interest or fees owed, the investor will receive the amount paid for the certificate plus the interest earned. This amount is considered a return of principal and is not taxable income.



In the event of foreclosure, the investor is able to take ownership. The investor will become responsible for paying property taxes on the property going forward. Any income or gains earned from the sale or rental of the property will also be subject to income taxes as if the property was acquired through "normal" acquisition means. Some states and localities may also impose taxes or fees on tax lien certificate investments.


   Tax Liens vs. Mortgage Liens  

A tax lien and a mortgage lien are both legal claims against a property. However, they are significantly different in a few ways. A tax lien is placed on a property by the government to collect unpaid property taxes, while a mortgage lien is placed on a property by a lender to secure a loan used to purchase the property.



Potentially most important to investors, tax liens generally have priority over mortgage liens in the event of default. This means that if a property is foreclosed on due to unpaid taxes, the government's tax lien will typically be satisfied before any mortgage liens are paid. This also means the individual that owns a mortgage lien is more at-risk to lose their principal investment and not receive any funds.



Property owners have the right to redeem a tax lien by paying the unpaid taxes plus any interest or fees owed. Mortgage liens can be satisfied by paying off the underlying loan. In this manner, both liens are similar in that they represent debt that may be repaid. The underlying nature of that debt is different.



Last, tax liens are typically placed on a property for a specific period of time. After that time has passed, a local entity may wish to sell the lien to an investor through a tax lien certificate sale. Mortgage liens can last for the duration of the mortgage loan which may be significantly longer.




Is Tax Lien Investing a Good Idea?
Property tax lien investing may be a plausible investment for investors looking to hold alternative investments and want exposure to real estate. IN addition, it's a reasonable way for investors to own real estate without the necessity of holding tangible property. It's usually advised to have an understanding of the local real estate market and do research on properties prior to investing.




What Is the Risk of Tax Lien Investing?
There are several downsides to tax lien investing. It may be easy to overbid on tax lien properties or not fully understanding property redemption periods. You may hold lesser claim to other, more strongly perfected liens on the property. Last, the major risk is that the property own files for bankruptcy and recognizes the realization that they will be unable to ever repay the delinquent tax.




Does a Tax Lien Hurt Your Credit?
Having a tax lien against you doesn't necessarily hurt your credit. The three major credit bureaus do not include tax lients from consumer credit reports. Be mindful that property tax liens may be public record and widely available to the general population that you owe an outstanding tax bill.


   The Bottom Line  

A tax lien certificate is representation of ownership regarding defaulted taxes owed on a property. When a local government is unable to collect property taxes, it creates a lien against the property and may auction the rights to that lien. Should the original property owner be able to pay the tax lien in the future, the investor who purchased the tax lien certificate may be able to recoup their principal while also earning some interest via penalty fees.
What Is a Tax Loss Carryforward?  

A tax loss carryforward (or carryover) is a provision that allows a taxpayer to move a tax loss to future years to offset a profit. The tax loss carryforward can be claimed by an individual or a business to reduce any future tax payments.  





Key Takeaways:

A tax loss carryforward allows taxpayers to use a taxable loss in the current period and apply it to a future tax period.Capital losses that exceed capital gains in a year may be used to offset ordinary taxable income up to $3,000 in any future tax year, indefinitely, until exhausted.Net operating losses (NOLs), losses incurred in business pursuits, can be carried forward indefinitely as a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA); however, they are limited to 80% of the taxable income in the year the carryforward is used.Prior to the TCJA, NOLs could be carried forward 20 years or back two years with no dollar limitation, up to the amount of taxable income in the year the carryforward or carryback was used.The CARES Act in 2020 further modified the rules around NOLs for tax years 2018 to 2020.


   How Tax Loss Carryforwards Work  

Consider a tax loss carryforward to be the opposite of profit, or a negative profit, for tax purposes. A negative profit occurs when expenses are greater than revenue or capital losses are greater than capital gains. This provision is a great tool for creating future tax relief. There are two main types of loss carryforwards: net operating loss (NOL) carryforwards and capital loss carryforwards.


  Net Operating Loss Carryforward  

For income tax purposes, an NOL is the result when a company's allowable deductions exceed its taxable income within a tax period. The NOL can be used to offset the company's tax payments in other tax periods through an Internal Revenue Service (IRS) tax provision called an NOL carryforward. An NOL carryforward applies the current year's NOL against future years' net income to reduce its tax liability in the future tax period.



For example, if a company experiences negative net operating income (NOI) in year one, but positive NOI in subsequent years, it can reduce future profits using the NOL carryforward to record some or all of the loss from the first year in the subsequent years. This results in lower taxable income in positive NOI years, reducing the amount the company owes the government in taxes. The purpose behind this tax provision is to allow some form of tax relief when a company loses money in a tax period. Because the company pays taxes only in years of positive NOI, the only way to minimize the tax impact of the loss is to offset income in positive NOI years.



The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) recognizes that some companies' business profits are cyclical in nature and not in line with a standard tax year. For example, a farming business is subject to various weather conditions and may have significant profits and a large tax payment in one year, incur an NOL in the next, and then follow that with another profitable year. To smooth the tax burden, the loss carryforward provision allows for the NOL in the second year to offset taxes due in the third year.


  Limitations on Net Operating Loss Carryforwards  

Prior to the implementation of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) in 2018, the IRS allowed businesses to carry NOLs forward 20 years to net against future profits or backward two years for an immediate refund of previous taxes paid. After 20 years, any remaining losses that were unused expired and could no longer be used to reduce taxable income.



For tax years beginning Jan. 1, 2018, or later, the TCJA has removed the two-year carryback provision, except for certain farming losses and non-life insurance companies. However, the provision now allows for an indefinite carryforward period. However, the carryforwards are now limited to 80% of each subsequent year's net income. Losses originating in tax years beginning prior to Jan. 1, 2018, are still subject to the former tax rules, and any remaining losses will still expire after 20 years.



Under the TCJA rules, farming losses may be carried back two years for an immediate refund of prior taxes paid or carried forward indefinitely. Non-life insurance companies are essentially still using pre-TCJA rules. They may carry back two years or forward 20, and the 80% limit in any one year does not apply.


  Additional Temporary Modifications to Limitations  

The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act in 2020 further modified the rules surrounding NOL carryforwards, temporarily. According to the IRS, "the CARES Act effectively delays the application of the TCJA amendments until Jan. 1, 2021. Additionally, the CARES Act permits a five-year carryback for NOLs, including farming losses and NOLs of non-life insurance companies, for taxable years beginning after Dec. 31, 2017 and before Jan. 1, 2021."



The CARES Act allowed corporate taxpayers with eligible NOLs in tax years 2018 to 2020 to claim a refund for prior year tax returns by applying the NOL as a carryback, up to five tax years preceding the tax year of the loss. It is typically more beneficial for a corporation to apply a NOL as a carryback rather than a carryforward due to the time value of money. Essentially, a refund in the current year of previous taxes paid is typically more beneficial than a future reduction of taxes owed unless there is a reason specific to the corporation that may make a carryforward more advantageous. The CARES Act also temporarily removed the 80% limitation in any one year, reinstating it for tax years beginning after 2020.



In tax year 2021, the special rules for NOLs introduced by the CARES act were officially eliminated with an exception for certain farming losses.


   Example of a Net Operating Loss Carryforward  

For a simple example of the NOL carryforward rules post-TCJA, imagine a company loses $5 million in 2021 and earns $6 million in 2022. The carryover limit of 80% of $6 million in 2022 is $4.8 million. The NOL carryforward lowers the taxable income in 2022 to $1.2 million ($6 million 2022 income—$4.8 million allowable NOL carryforward). Calculation of the company's deferred tax asset would include a $200,000 NOL carryforward ($5 million total NOL—$4.8 million used NOL carryforward), which could be used after 2022.


   Real-World Example of a Net Operating Loss Carryback  

Tax loss carryforwards and carrybacks received new attention in September 2020 when the New York Times released details surrounding President Trump's 2009 tax return. According to the Times article, "confidential records show that starting in 2010 he claimed, and received, an income tax refund totaling $72.9 million—all the federal income tax he had paid for 2005 through 2008, plus interest." This was made possible through an NOL carryback provision that changed as a result of the Worker, Homeownership, and Business Assistance Act of 2009, signed into law by President Obama.



The 2009 tax law allowed a five-year NOL carryback provision for tax years 2008 and 2009, rather than the two-year carryback provision that was in place at the time. This meant that NOLs incurred during 2008 and 2009 could be applied toward a refund of taxes previously paid in the five years preceding the loss. If the taxpayer elected to carry back an NOL to the fifth preceding year, the NOL carryback was limited to 50% of the taxable income in the fifth preceding year. However, the remaining NOL balance could be carried forward to the fourth preceding year, and so on, until the loss was fully exhausted.


   Capital Loss Carryforward  

Capital gains and losses result from the sale of capital assets, such as stocks, bonds, jewelry, antiques, and real estate. When capital assets are sold, the gain (or loss) on the sale is the difference between its selling price and its tax basis (generally, the purchase price of the asset plus the cost of improvements). If the selling price is more than the tax basis, the result is a capital gain. If the selling price is less than the tax basis, the result is a loss.



Net capital losses (the amount that total capital losses exceed total capital gains) can only be deducted, to offset ordinary income, up to a maximum of $3,000 in a tax year ($1,500 for married filing separately). Net capital losses exceeding the $3,000 threshold may be carried forward to future tax years until exhausted. There is no limit to the number of years there might be a capital loss carryover.



Capital loss tax provisions lessen the severity of the impact caused by investment losses. However, there are exceptions. Investors must be careful of wash sale provisions, which prohibit repurchasing an investment within 30 days of selling it for a loss. If this occurs, the capital loss cannot be applied toward tax calculations and is instead added to the cost basis of the new position, lessening the impact of future capital gains.


   Example of a Capital Loss Carryforward  

Assume, for example, that a taxpayer sold 1,000 shares of XYZ stock for a capital loss totaling $10,000, and the taxpayer had owned the stock for three years. Capital gains and losses are reported on Schedule D of the IRS Form 1040 tax return. If a stock is held for more than a year, the holding period is typically long term (with certain exceptions in 2018 and later for "applicable partnership interests which are considered long-term after three years"). The taxpayer offsets long-term gains with long-term losses.



Assume that the taxpayer also has $3,000 in long-term gains, which reduces the net long-term capital loss to $7,000. The taxpayer can take $3,000 of that loss as a deduction to reduce other income, called ordinary income, on the current year tax return. The remaining long-term capital loss is $4,000, which can be carried forward to the next tax year to offset capital gains and ordinary income up to the $3,000 limit. This tax policy allows investors who realize large losses during market downturns to reduce gains recognized over many future years.
What Is Tax-Loss Harvesting?  

Tax-loss harvesting is the timely selling of securities at a loss to offset the amount of capital gains tax owed from selling profitable assets. This strategy is commonly used to limit short-term capital gains, commonly taxed at a higher rate than long-term capital gains, to preserve the value of the investor’s portfolio while reducing taxes.





Key Takeaways

Tax-loss harvesting is a strategy investors can use to reduce capital gains taxes owed from selling profitable investments.The strategy involves selling an asset or security at a net loss.The investor can use proceeds from a sale to purchase a similar asset and maintain the portfolio balance.


   Understanding Tax-Loss Harvesting  

Tax-loss harvesting is also known as tax-loss selling. Most investors use this strategy at the end of the year when they assess the annual performance of their portfolios and its impact on their taxes. An investment that shows a loss in value can be sold to claim a credit against the profits that were realized in other assets.



Tax-loss harvesting is a tool for reducing overall taxes. A loss in the value of Security A could be sold to offset the increase in the price of Security B, thus eliminating the capital gains tax liability of Security B. Using the tax-loss harvesting strategy, investors can realize significant tax savings.






If your capital losses for the year exceed your capital gains, you can deduct up to $3,000 in net losses from your total annual income. If your net losses exceed $3,000, Internal Revenue Service (IRS) rules allow the additional losses to be carried forward into the following tax years.


   Maintaining Your Portfolio  

Selling an asset at a loss disrupts the balance of the portfolio. After tax-loss harvesting, investors with carefully constructed portfolios replace the asset sold with a similar asset to maintain the portfolio's asset mix and expected risk and return levels. Investors should avoid buying the same asset that they just sold at a loss which may violate the IRS wash-sale rule.






Losses on your investments are first used to offset capital gains of the same type. Therefore, short-term losses are first used to offset short-term capital gains tax, and long-term losses are first used to offset long-term capital gains tax. But net losses of either type can then be deducted against the other kind of gain.


   The Wash-Sale Rule  

The wash-sale rule requires an investor to avoid buying the same stock sold at a loss for tax purposes. A wash sale involves the sale of one security and, within 30 days, purchasing a substantially identical stock or security. If a transaction is considered a wash-sale, it cannot be used to offset capital gains, and if wash-sale rules are abused, regulators can impose fines or restrict the individual's trading.



Using ETFs that track the same or similar indexes can be used to replace one another while avoiding violating the wash sale rule in a tax-loss harvesting strategy. If you sell one S&P 500 index ETF at a loss, you can buy a different S&P 500 index ETF to harvest the capital loss.


   Example of Tax-Loss Harvesting  

Assume a single investor earns an income of $580,000 in 2023. The investor's marginal income tax rate is 37% and is subject to the highest long-term capital gains tax category, where gains are taxed at 20%. Short-term capital gains are taxed at the investor's marginal rate.



Below are the investor's portfolio gains and losses and trading activity for the year:



Portfolio:



Mutual Fund A: $250,000 unrealized gain, held for 450 daysMutual Fund B: $130,000 unrealized loss, held for 635 daysMutual Fund C: $100,000 unrealized loss, held for 125 days



Trading Activity:



Mutual Fund E: Sold, realized a gain of $200,000. Fund was held for 380 daysMutual Fund F: Sold, realized a gain of $150,000. Fund was held for 150 days



The tax owed from these sales is:



Tax without harvesting = ($200,000 x 20%) + ($150,000 x 37%) = $40,000 + $55,500 = $95,500



If the investor harvested losses by selling mutual funds B and C, the sales would help to offset the gains, and the tax owed would be:



Tax with harvesting = (($200,000 - $130,000) x 20%) + (($150,000 - $100,000) x 37%) = $14,000 + $18,500 = $32,500




How Does Tax-Loss Harvesting Work?
Tax-loss harvesting takes advantage of the fact that capital losses can be used to offset capital gains. An investor can "bank" capital losses from unprofitable investments to pay fewer capital gains tax on profitable investments sold during the year. This strategy includes using the proceeds of selling unprofitable investments to buy similar investments that preserve the portfolio's overall balance.




What Is a Substantially Identical Security and How Does It Affect Tax-Loss Harvesting?
The investor cannot violate the IRS' wash sale rule by selling an asset at a loss and buying a substantially identical asset within 30 days before or after that sale. Doing so will invalidate the tax loss write-off. A substantially identical security is defined as a security issued by the same company or a derivative contract issued on the same security.




How Much Tax-Loss Harvesting Can I Use in a Year?
According to the IRS, "if your capital losses exceed your capital gains, the amount of the excess loss that you can claim to lower your income is the lesser of $3,000 ($1,500 if married filing separately) or your total net loss shown on line 16 of Schedule D (Form 1040). If your net capital loss is more than this limit, you can carry the loss forward to later years."


   The Bottom Line  

Tax-loss harvesting is the timely selling of securities at a loss to offset the amount of capital gains tax owed from selling profitable assets. An individual taxpayer can write off up to $3,000 in net losses annually.
What Is Tax Planning?  

Tax planning is the analysis of a financial situation or plan to ensure that all elements work together to allow you to pay the lowest taxes possible. A plan that minimizes how much you pay in taxes is referred to as tax efficient. Tax planning should be an essential part of an individual investor's financial plan. Reduction of tax liability and maximizing the ability to contribute to retirement plans are crucial for success.





Key Takeaways

Tax planning is the analysis of a financial situation or plan to ensure that all elements work together to allow you to pay the lowest taxes possible.Considerations of tax planning include the timing of income, size, the timing of purchases, and planning for expenditures.Tax planning strategies can include saving for retirement in an IRA or engaging in tax gain-loss harvesting.


   Understanding Tax Planning  

Tax planning covers several considerations. Considerations include timing of income, size, and timing of purchases, and planning for other expenditures. Also, the selection of investments and types of retirement plans must complement the tax filing status and deductions to create the best possible outcome.


   Retirement Saving Strategies  

Saving via a retirement plan is a popular way to efficiently reduce taxes. Contributing money to a traditional IRA can minimize gross income by the amount contributed. For 2022, if meeting all qualifications, a filer under age 50 can contribute a maximum of $6,000 to their IRA with an additional catch-up contribution of $1,000 if age 50 or older. That number rises to $6,500 in 2023, with the catch-up contribution holding steady at $1,000.



For example, if a 52-year-old male with an annual income of $50,000 who made a $7,000 contribution to a traditional IRA has an adjusted gross income of $43,000, the $7,000 contribution would grow tax-deferred until retirement.



There are several other retirement plans that an individual may use to help reduce tax liability. 401(k) plans are popular with larger companies that have many employees. Participants in the plan can defer income from their paycheck directly into the company’s 401(k) plan. The greatest difference is that the contribution limit dollar amount is much higher than that of an IRA. 



Using the same example as above, the 52-year-old could contribute up to $27,000 into their 401(k) in 2022 (rising to $30,000 in 2023). That's because in 2022, if a person is under age 50, the salary contribution can be up to $20,500 ($22,500 for 2023), or up to $27,000 ($30,000 for 2022) if age 50 or older due to the allowed additional $6,500 catch-up contribution. The catch-up contribution for 2023 rises to $7,500.


   Tax Planning vs. Tax Gain-Loss Harvesting  

Tax gain-loss harvesting is another form of tax planning or management relating to investments. It is helpful because it can use a portfolio's losses to offset overall capital gains. According to the IRS, short and long-term capital losses must first be used to offset capital gains of the same type. In other words, long-term losses offset long-term gains before offsetting short-term gains. Short-term capital gains, or earnings from assets owned for less than one year, are taxed at ordinary income rates. 



As of 2022, long-term capital gains are taxed as follows: 



0% for single filers whose income is no more than $41,675 ($83,350 in the case of a joint return or widow(er), $55,800 in the case of an individual who is head of household, or $41,675 in the case of a married individual filing a separate return)15% tax for single filers whose income is between $41,676 and $459,750 ($517,200 in the case of a joint return or widow(er), $488,500 in the case of an individual who is the head of a household, or $258,600 in the case of a married individual filing a separate return)20% tax for those whose income is higher than listed for the 15% tax



In 2023, long-term capital gain limits will be increasing to the following:



0% for single filers whose income is no more than $44,625 ($89,250 in the case of a joint return or widow(er), $59,750 in the case of an individual who is head of household, $44,625 in the case of a married individual filing a separate return)15% tax for single filers whose income is between $44,626 and $492,300 ($553,850 in the case of a joint return or widow(er), $523,050 in the case of an individual who is the head of a household, or $276,900 in the case of a married individual filing a separate return)20% tax for those whose income is higher than that listed for the 15% tax



For example, if a single investor whose income was $100,000 had $10,000 in long-term capital gains, there would be a tax liability of $1,500. If the same investor sold underperforming investments carrying $10,000 in long-term capital losses, the losses would offset the gains, resulting in a tax liability of 0. If the same losing investment were brought back, then a minimum of 30 days would have to pass to avoid incurring a wash sale. 



According to the Internal Revenue Service, "If your capital losses exceed your capital gains, the amount of the excess loss that you can claim to lower your income is the lesser of $3,000 ($1,500 if married filing separately) or your total net loss shown on (line 21) of Schedule D (Form 1040 or 1040-SR).



For example, if the 52-year-old investor had $3,000 in net capital losses for the year, the $50,000 income will be adjusted to $47,000. The remaining capital losses can be carried over with no expiration to offset future capital gains.
What Is a Tax Rate?  

A tax rate is a percentage at which an individual or corporation is taxed. The United States uses a progressive tax rate system imposed by the federal government and many states in which the percentage of tax charged increases as the amount of the person's or entity's taxable income increases. A progressive tax rate collects more from taxpayers with higher incomes.





Key Takeaways


A tax rate is a percentage at which an individual or corporation is taxed.
The U.S. imposes a progressive tax rate on income, where the higher the income, the greater percentage of tax is levied.
The U.S. applies its tax rate in marginal increments, so taxpayers are charged at an effective tax rate lower than the bracket rate.
Tax rates are also applied as sales tax on goods and services or as capital gains tax on investments.
Some other nations charge a flat tax rate or a regressive tax rate.



   Understanding Tax Rates  

To help build and maintain the infrastructure, a government taxes its residents. The tax collected is used for the betterment of the nation, society, and all living in it. In the U.S. and other countries, a tax rate is applied to taxpayer income.



Whether earned from wages or salary, investment income like dividends and interest, capital gains from investments, or profits made from goods or services, a percentage of earnings are remitted to the government.



For income tax, the tax rate is the percentage of an individual's taxable income or a corporation's earnings owed to state, federal, and, in some cases, municipal governments. The tax rate applied to an individual’s earnings depends on the marginal tax bracket. The marginal tax rate used by the U.S. government is indicative of its progressive tax system.


   Effective Tax Rates  

For individuals, the dollar threshold for each tax rate is dependent upon the status of the filer, whether they are single, the head of a household, married filing separately, or married filing jointly. The marginal tax brackets for 2022 and 2023 are:

A single individual who earns $62,000 in 2023 will be taxed as follows: 10% on the first $11,000; 12% on the next $33,725 (the amount over $11,000 up to $44,725); then 22% on the remaining $17,275 (the amount over $44,725 up to $95,375), all of which equals $8,947.50.



Another individual who earns $160,000 will be taxed 10% on the first $11,000; 12% on the next $33,725; 22% on the next $50,650 (the amount over $44,725 up to $95,375); then 24% on the remaining $64,625 (the amount of income that falls between $95,375 and $182,100), all of which equals $31,800.



Following this example, the single taxpayer who falls under the third marginal tax bracket will pay less tax than the single filer who falls in the fourth and higher bracket.






A marginal tax rate means that different portions of income are taxed at progressively higher rates.



Although these taxpayers fall in the third and fourth marginal brackets, they do not pay flat rates of 22% and 24%, respectively, on all of their income due to the nature of the marginal tax calculation. If they did, the first individual would pay 22% x $62,000 = $13,640; the second pays 24% x $160,000 = $38,400. In total, individual A pays an effective rate of 14.4% ($8,947.50 ÷ $62,000), and the individual with the higher income pays a rate of 19.9% ($31,800 ÷ $160,000). These rates are called effective tax rates and represent the actual percentage at which the tax is levied during a tax year.


   Sales and Capital Gains Tax Rates  

Tax rates also apply as sales tax on goods and services, real property tax, short-term capital gains tax, and long-term capital gains tax. When a consumer purchases certain goods and services from a retailer, a sales tax is applied to the sales price of the commodity at the point of sale. Since sales tax is governed by individual state governments, the sales tax rate will vary from state to state. In Georgia, the rate is 4%, while the tax rate in California is 7.25%.



Income gained from investments is categorized as earnings, and tax rates on capital gains and dividends apply. When the value of an investment rises and the security is sold for a profit, the tax rate that the investor pays depends on how long they held the asset. The tax rate of a short-term investment held for one year or less is equal to the investor’s ordinary income tax. Individuals in the 22% marginal tax bracket will pay 22% on short-term capital gains.



The tax rate on profits from investments held longer than a year ranges from 0% to 20%. For the taxable year 2023, individuals with taxable income below $44,625 pay 0%. Individuals with taxable income between $44,625 and $492,300 pay 15%, and investors with income above $492,300 pay a 20% tax rate on capital gains.



Qualified dividends are subject to the same tax rate schedule for long-term capital gains. Non-qualified dividends have the same tax rates as short-term capital gains.


   Tax Rates Abroad  

Tax rates vary from country to country. Some countries implement a progressive tax system, while others use regressive or proportional tax rates. A regressive tax schedule is one in which the tax rate increases as the taxable amount decreases.



The proportional or flat tax rate system applies the same tax rates to all taxable amounts, regardless of income level. Bolivia and Greenland are examples of countries that have this system of taxes in place.




How Are Tax Rates Imposed?
A tax rate can apply to goods and services or income and is defined by a government. The rate is commonly expressed as a percentage of the value of what is being taxed.




What Is a Tax Bracket?
A tax bracket defines a range of incomes subject to an income tax rate. Tax brackets are part of a progressive tax, in which the level of tax rates progressively increases as an individual’s income grows. Low incomes fall into tax brackets with lower tax rates, while higher earners fall into brackets with higher rates.




What Is the Difference Between a Marginal Tax Rate and an Effective Tax Rate?
A marginal tax rate is the amount of tax that applies to each additional income level as defined by the tax brackets. In the United States, taxpayers pay more taxes as their income rises. A taxpayer’s average tax rate is their effective tax rate or the share of their total annual income they will pay in taxes.


   The Bottom Line  

A tax rate is a percentage at which an individual or corporation is taxed. The U.S. imposes a progressive tax, where the higher the individual's income, the greater percentage of tax is paid. Tax rates are also applied as sales tax on goods and services or as capital gains tax on investments. Other nations may impose a progressive tax, while others charge a flat tax rate or a regressive tax rate.
What Is the Tax Reform Act of 1986?  

The Tax Reform Act of 1986 is a law passed by the United States Congress to simplify the income tax code. To increase fairness and provide an incentive for growth in the economy, the passage of the Act reduced the maximum rate on ordinary income and raised the tax rate on long-term capital gains.



It was followed by the Tax Reform Act of 1993.





Key Takeaways

The Tax Reform Act of 1986 was a comprehensive tax reform legislation that was passed into law by President Ronald Reagan.The law effectively lowered the top marginal tax bracket income tax rates while eliminating several loopholes.The 1986 reform was followed up by subsequent bills in 1993 and later.


   Understanding the Tax Reform Act of 1986  

Signed into law by Republican President Ronald Reagan on October 22, 1986, the Tax Reform Act of 1986 was sponsored in Congress by Richard Gephardt (D-MO) in the House of Representatives and Bill Bradley (D-NJ) in the Senate. The act is commonly known to be the second of two Reagan tax cuts, the first being the Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981.



The Tax Reform Act of 1986 lowered the top tax rate for ordinary income from 50% to 28% and raised the bottom tax rate from 11% to 15%. This was the first time in U.S. income tax history that the top tax rate was lowered and the bottom rate was increased at the same time.



The Tax Reform Act of 1986 also provided for the elimination of the distinction between long-term capital gains and ordinary income. The act mandated that capital gains be taxed at the same rate as ordinary income, raising the maximum tax rate on long-term capital gains to 28% from 20%.



Prior to the passing of the act, capital gains were either taxed at lower rates than ordinary income under an alternative tax or received a partial exclusion from tax under the regular rate schedule. Sixty percent of capital gains on assets held for at least six months were excluded from taxable income. Thus, the marginal tax rate on net long-term capital gains was only 40% of the marginal tax rate on other forms of income under the previous tax laws.



In addition to altering the tax brackets, the Tax Reform Act of 1986 eliminated certain tax shelters. It required people claiming children as dependents to provide Social Security numbers for each child on their tax returns, it expanded the Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT)—the least tax that an individual or corporation must pay after all eligible exclusions, credits, and deductions have been taken—and increased the Home Mortgage Interest Deduction to incentivize homeownership.



While the act ended tax code provisions that allowed individuals to deduct interest on consumer loans, it increased personal exemptions and standard deduction amounts indexed to inflation.



For businesses, the corporate tax rate was reduced from 50% to 35%. The Tax Reform Act of 1986 also reduced the allowances for certain business expenses, such as business meals, travel, and entertainment, and restricted deductions for certain other expenses.


   Tax Reform Act of 1993  

The Clinton Administration subsequently created the Tax Reform Act in 1993 to contain several major provisions for individuals, such as the addition of the 36% tax bracket, an increase in gasoline taxes, and an additional tax of 10% on married couples with income above $250,000. It also raised taxes on Social Security benefits and eliminated the tax cap on Medicare. The Tax Reform Act was one of President Clinton’s first tax packages, and it led to a lot of significant changes in tax law for both individuals and businesses.



The Tax Reform Act of 1993 was a piece of legislation also known as the Revenue Reconciliation Act of 1993. Individuals were not the only ones affected by this legislation. For instance, the corporate tax rate was raised as well, along with a lengthening of the goodwill depreciation period and the elimination of deductibility for congressional lobbying expenses.



Many other taxes were raised and deductions reduced or eliminated as well. The act was also one of the first bills to retroactively raise the tax rate, effectively making the increased tax rates law for taxpayers for the beginning of the year, despite the fact that the act was signed into law on August 10.
What Is a Tax Refund?  

The term "tax refund" refers to a reimbursement made to a taxpayer for any excess amount paid in taxes to the federal or state government. While taxpayers tend to look at a refund as a bonus or a stroke of luck, it often represents what is essentially an interest-free loan that the taxpayer made to the government. It’s often possible to avoid overpaying your taxes so you can keep more money in your pocket each paycheck—and avoid a refund when you file your tax return.





Key Takeaways

If you get a tax refund, then you likely overpaid your taxes during the previous tax year.You may also receive a refund if you qualify for a refundable tax credit, such as the Earned Income Tax Credit, premium tax credit, or Child Tax Credit.Employees can avoid overpaying by accurately filling out their W-4s and ensuring that the information is current.Self-employed taxpayers can avoid overpaying by estimating their quarterly taxes with greater accuracy.A tax bill is the opposite of a tax refund, which you owe if your employer didn't withhold enough taxes from your pay.


   Understanding Tax Refunds  

It can be exciting to get a large tax refund. You can expect to get a refund if you overpaid your taxes during the year. This generally happens when taxes are deducted from your paycheck every time you get paid by your employer.



Here are some reasons why a taxpayer might get a refund:



The taxpayer made an error in filling out Form W-4, used to estimate the correct amount of withholding from the employee’s paycheck.
The taxpayer intentionally fills out their W-4 to have a higher withholding and larger tax refund at tax time.
The taxpayer forgot to update their W-4 to reflect a change of circumstances, such as the birth of a child and an additional child tax credit (CTC).
A freelancer or self-employed person who files quarterly estimated taxes may overpay to avoid a surprise tax bill or underpayment penalties at tax time.
The taxpayer is eligible for refundable tax credits, which can reduce the amount of taxes owed below $0. In other words, if the credit is larger than your tax bill, you will receive a refund for the difference.



Tax refunds are the opposite of a tax bill, which refers to taxes owed by a taxpayer. In the case of a tax bill, you owe more taxes to the government than you paid during the year. You normally have a tax bill if your employer doesn't withhold enough taxes from your paycheck.






To avoid overpaying, you must fill out your W-4 correctly and update it if you experience a significant life change, such as marriage, divorce, adoption, a new freelance job or gig, the birth of a child, a financial windfall.


   Special Considerations  

Taxpayers are generally better off not overpaying their taxes in the first place because that money could be put to better use. For example, you could adjust your withholding (or estimated quarterly taxes, if you’re self-employed) and invest that extra money in your individual retirement account (IRA), 401(k), or even an interest-yielding savings account. That way, the money is working for you instead of for the federal government.


   Refundable Tax Credits  

Most tax credits are nonrefundable, meaning that the tax credit can only reduce a taxpayer’s liability to $0. Any remaining amount from a nonrefundable tax credit is automatically forfeited by the taxpayer. For this reason, this type of tax credit is sometimes called a wastable tax credit.



In contrast, a refundable tax credit pays out in full, meaning that a taxpayer is entitled to the entire amount of the credit regardless of their income or tax liability. If the tax credit reduces the tax liability to below $0, then the taxpayer gets a refund. Refundable tax credits include:


  Child Tax Credit (CTC)  

The child tax credit is $2,000 maximum for eligible taxpayers. The fully refundable portion is $1,500 for 2022 and $1,600 for 2023.


  Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC)  

The Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) gives low- and moderate-income workers and families a tax break. The credit ranges from $6,935 in 2022 and $7,430 in 2023. The amount of credit that a taxpayer receives depends on their income, filing status, and the number of children they have. For example, eligible taxpayers who have no children will receive $500 for tax year 2022.


  American Opportunity Tax Credit (AOTC)  

The American Opportunity Tax Credit (AOTC) is a partially refundable tax credit that is available to taxpayers to offset qualified higher education expenses (QHEEs). If a taxpayer reduces their tax liability to $0 before using the entire portion of the $2,500 tax deduction, then the remainder may be taken as a refundable credit up to the lesser of 40% of the remaining credit or $1,000.


  Premium Tax Credit (PTC)  

Low- and moderate-income households may qualify for the premium tax credit (PTC), which lowers the monthly premiums for health plans offered through the federal and state health benefit exchanges. Taxpayers can use all, some, or none of their PTC in advance (i.e., up front). If taxpayers use less PTC than they qualify for, they will get the difference as a refundable credit at tax time.


   How a Tax Refund Works  

Tax refunds usually are issued either as checks and sent by U.S. mail or as direct deposits to the taxpayer’s bank account. Alternatively, taxpayers can use the refund to buy U.S. Series I Savings Bonds. The fastest way to get a refund is to e-file your tax return and choose direct deposit.



Most refunds are issued within a few weeks of when the taxpayer files their tax return. However, there may be some instances where a refund takes longer.



For example, taxpayers who claim the EITC won't receive their refunds before March. That's because the law requires the IRS to hold on to these refunds until March due to years of fraudulent filings for the credit.



Refunds are always pleasant, but it would be better to avoid overpaying in the first place by correctly filling out your W-4 or precisely calculating your estimated taxes. The closer you get your refund to zero, the more money you will have throughout the prior year.



Of course, not everyone agrees. Some people consider tax refunds an alternative savings plan and look forward to the lump-sum repayment.




When Can I Expect My Tax Refund?
The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) claims that it issues “most refunds in less than 21 calendar days.” If you claim the Earned Income Tax Credit or the additional child tax credit, then your refund will arrive no sooner than early March.




Why Do People Get Tax Refunds?
You get a refund if you overpaid your taxes the year before. This can happen if your employer withholds too much from your paychecks (based on the information you provided on your W-4). If you’re self-employed, you may get a refund if you overpaid your estimated quarterly taxes. Refundable tax credits, such as the EITC, can also lead to refunds.




How Do I Check on the Status of My Tax Refund?
You can use the IRS’s Where’s My Refund? tool to check the status of your most recently filed tax return within the past two tax years. You can start checking Where’s My Refund? 24 hours after the IRS receives your electronically filed tax return or four weeks after you mail a paper tax return.


   The Bottom Line  

A tax refund is an amount of money that the government reimburses taxpayers who pay more than they owe in taxes. In general, it's a good idea to calculate the taxes that you'll owe as precisely as possible so that you don't overpay throughout the year. That way you can keep more of your money and put it to work for your best interests, whether that's earning a return and building your savings or paying off debt.
What Is Tax Relief?  

Tax relief refers to any government program or policy designed to help individuals and businesses reduce their tax burdens or resolve their tax-related debts.



Tax relief may be in the form of universal tax cuts, targeted programs that benefit specific groups of taxpayers, or initiatives that bolster particular goals of the government. For example, the child tax credit gives a tax break to parents of minor children, while the tax credit for green improvements (e.g., energy-efficient windows) furthers the goal of U.S. energy independence and cleaner air.





Key Takeaways

Various types of tax relief can help you lower your tax bill or settle tax-related debts.Tax deductions let you deduct certain expenses (such as home mortgage interest) from your taxable income, thereby lowering the amount of tax you owe.Tax credits directly reduce your tax bill and may provide a refund even if you don't owe any tax.The IRS Fresh Start program helps individuals and businesses settle back taxes and avoid tax liens.


   Tax Relief Basics  

Tax relief programs and initiatives help taxpayers reduce their tax bills through tax deductions, credits, and exclusions. Other programs help taxpayers who are behind on their taxes settle their tax-related debts, potentially avoiding liens in the process.



Government policy goals are often the catalyst for amending the federal tax code. For example, in response to concerns about the general lack of retirement savings in the U.S., Congress created incentives to encourage people to save for retirement in tax-advantaged savings accounts—such as IRAs and 401(k)s.



Tax relief is also available for people affected by natural disasters. For example, the IRS made dozens of tax relief announcements in 2022 and 2023 to help individuals and businesses affected by severe storms, tornados, flooding, hurricanes, straight-line winds, wildfires, and drought. The relief typically comes in the form of filing and payment extensions, penalty and interest waivers, and deductions for casualty and theft losses sustained due to federally declared disasters.






You can't deduct casualty and theft losses covered by insurance unless you file a timely claim for reimbursement and reduce the loss by your anticipated reimbursement.


   Tax Deductions  

A tax deduction reduces your taxable income for the year, thereby lowering your tax bill. Taxpayers can take the standard deduction or itemize their deductions on Schedule A of Form 1040 or 1040-SR. (You can't do both.)


  Standard Deduction  

The standard deduction amount is based on your filing status, age, and whether you are disabled or claimed as a dependent on someone else's income tax return. Here are the standard deduction amounts for the 2022 and 2023 tax years.










Standard Deductions for 2022 and 2023


 Filing Status
2022 Standard Deduction
2023 Standard Deduction




Single
$12,950
$13,850


Married Filing Separately
$12,950
$13,850


Head of Household

Married Filing Jointly
$25,900
$27,700


Surviving Spouses
$25,900
$27,700






You can take an extra deduction if you are at least age 65 or legally blind by the end of the tax year. For tax year 2022, this "additional standard deduction" is $1,400 ($1,750 if filing as single or head of household) if you are 65 or older or blind. The amount doubles if you are 65 or older and blind. The additional standard deduction for 2023 is $1,500 ($1,850 if single or head of household).



If another taxpayer can claim you as a dependent, your standard deduction for tax year 2022 is limited to the greater of $1,150 or your earned income plus $400 (the total can't be more than the basic standard deduction for your filing status). For 2023, the standard deduction for a dependent is $1,250 or the individual's earned income plus $400.


  Itemized Deductions  

Itemized deductions are expenses that can be subtracted from your adjusted gross income to lower your taxable income—and tax bill. You can itemize your deductions only if you don't claim the standard deduction. It makes financial sense to itemize if the total amount you can deduct is greater than the standard deduction for your filing status. Common itemized deductions include:



Mortgage interest and discount points on the first $750,000 of secured mortgage debt (or $1 million if you bought the home before Dec. 16, 2017)
Charitable donations
Unreimbursed medical and dental expenses
State and local taxes (SALT)
Certain gambling losses
Investment interest expenses






Tax relief often targets specific taxpayers, such as those facing unexpected costs due to a hurricane or a wildfire.


   Tax Credits  

A tax credit is another form of tax relief. Unlike tax deductions, which lower your taxable income, tax credits directly reduce the amount of tax you owe.



Here's an example. Say a taxpayer takes the standard deduction, and their tax bill amounts to $3,000. If the person is also eligible for a $1,000 tax credit, their final tax bill would be $2,000. By comparison, with a $1,000 tax deduction, someone in the 22% tax bracket would save just $220.






Tax credits are more favorable than tax deductions because they reduce the amount of tax you owe, not just your taxable income.



This type of tax relief is often described as a tax incentive because it reimburses taxpayers for expenditures the government deems worthwhile. For example, the American opportunity tax credit (AOTC) and the lifetime learning credit (LLC) programs give tax credits to people who enroll in post-secondary education programs.



Other popular tax credits include:



Earned income tax credit (EITC)
Child tax credit
Saver's tax credit
Health Insurance Marketplace premium tax credit


   Tax Exclusions  

While tax deductions are amounts you deduct from your income, tax exclusions set aside certain types of income as non-taxable. As such, tax exclusions reduce your taxable income—and your tax bill. For example, you can generally exclude from your income any child support payments, life insurance death benefits, and municipal bond income you receive.



A common tax exclusion is the one for employer-sponsored health insurance. Health insurance premiums your employer pays are exempt from federal income and payroll taxes, and the portion of premiums you pay is generally excluded from your taxable income. The exclusion of premiums lowers your tax bill, effectively reducing your after-tax cost of health insurance coverage.






If you earned income overseas, you might be eligible for the foreign earned income exclusion and the foreign housing exclusion. To qualify, you must be a U.S. citizen or resident alien who is a resident of a foreign country for an uninterrupted period that includes the entire tax year.



Another popular tax exclusion pertains to selling a house. If you have a capital gain from the sale of your main home, you can exclude up to $250,000 ($500,000 if married filing jointly) of that gain from your income. To qualify, you must have owned and lived in the home for at least two out of the previous five years, and you must not have excluded the gain from the sale of another home within the last two years.



In some cases, income excluded for tax purposes is not recorded on the return. In other cases, it is recorded in one section of the return and then deducted in another area.


   Tax Debt Relief  

The IRS Fresh Start program helps taxpayers catch up on back taxes and avoid tax liens, levies, wage garnishments, and jail time. Launched in 2011, the program is a group of changes to the U.S. tax code that streamlines the collection process and makes it possible to settle your tax debt for less than the total amount you owe. Individuals and businesses are eligible for the program.



Here are four Fresh Start options for taxpayers behind on their tax payments:



Offer in compromise: This federal program helps you settle your IRS tax debt for less than the full amount you owe. The program is available to taxpayers who owe more money than they could reasonably pay at once—or if doing so would create a financial hardship.Currently not collectible (CNC): Under the CNC program, the IRS determines that your gross monthly income is too low to reasonably pay what you owe without triggering financial hardship. Collection is halted on your debt, and the IRS won't levy your bank accounts, garnish your wages, or seize your assets. Instead, you defer making payments until you're financially ready to pay.Installment agreement: An IRS installment agreement lets you pay the taxes you owe by making regular monthly payments over a specific, extended timeframe. Interest and penalties may continue accruing until you pay your balance in full.Penalty abatement: The IRS may reduce or remove penalties from your balance, but you must first prove that you had a legitimate reason for not paying your taxes on time. Reasonable cause includes fire, natural disasters, and other disturbances; the death, serious illness, or incapacitation of the taxpayer or a member of their immediate family; or an inability to obtain tax-related records. Note that the IRS states that "a lack of funds, in and of itself, is not reasonable cause for failure to file or pay on time." 



Keep in mind that, while helpful, the Fresh Start program isn't necessarily easy to navigate, and deciding which avenue to pursue can be tricky. If you have significant tax debt, consider working with a tax professional who can make sure you apply to the appropriate program and guide you through the process.




What Is the Difference Between a Tax Credit and a Tax Deduction?
Tax credits lower the amount of tax you owe, while tax deductions reduce your taxable income. Both save you money on your tax bill, but credits provide the most substantial savings.For example, a $1,000 tax credit lowers your tax bill by that same $1,000. Meanwhile, a $1,000 tax deduction lowers your taxable income by that amount. So, if you fall into the 24% tax bracket, a $1,000 deduction would shave $240 off of your tax bill.




What Is the Standard Deduction for 2023?
For 2023, the standard deduction is $13,850 for single and married filing separately taxpayers, $20,800 for heads of household, and $27,700 for married filing jointly filers and surviving spouses.




What Is the Standard Deduction for 2022?
For tax year 2022, the standard deduction is $12,950 for single and married filing separately taxpayers, $19,400 for heads of household, and $25,900 for married filing jointly filers and surviving spouses.

The annual exclusion for gifts is $17,000 for 2023, up from $16,000 in tax year 2022. That means you can give up to $17,000 tax-free to as many people as you wish without using any of your lifetime gift and estate tax exemption.


   The Bottom Line  

Tax relief constitutes government programs or policies that help lessen the burden of taxes for individuals. These are usually done through tax deductions, credits, and exclusions. When filing your taxes, make sure you take advantage of all of these options so that you don't end up paying more taxes than you need to. When in doubt, consult with a tax professional or financial advisor.
What Is a Tax Return?  

A tax return is a form or forms filed with a tax authority that reports income, expenses, and other pertinent tax information. Tax returns allow taxpayers to calculate their tax liability, schedule tax payments, or request refunds for the overpayment of taxes. In most countries, tax returns must be filed annually for an individual or business with reportable income, including wages, interest, dividends, capital gains, or other profits.





Key Takeaways

A tax return is a documentation filed with a tax authority that reports income, expenses, and other relevant financial information.On tax returns, taxpayers calculate their tax liability, schedule tax payments, or request refunds for the overpayment of taxes.In most places, tax returns must be filed annually.


   Understanding Tax Returns  

In the United States, tax returns are filed with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) or with the state or local tax collection agency (Massachusetts Department of Revenue, for example) containing information used to calculate taxes. Tax returns are generally prepared using forms prescribed by the IRS or other relevant authority.



In the U.S., individuals use variations of the Internal Revenue System's Form 1040 to file federal income taxes. Corporations will use Form 1120 and partnerships will use Form 1065 to file their annual returns. A variety of 1099 forms are used to report income from non-employment-related sources. Application for automatic extension of time to file U.S. individual income tax return is through Form 4868.



Typically, a tax return begins with the taxpayer providing personal information, which includes their filing status, and dependent information. 


   The Sections of a Tax Return  

In general, tax returns have three major sections where you can report your income, and determine deductions and tax credits for which you are eligible:


  Income  

The income section of a tax return lists all sources of income. The most common method of reporting is a W-2 form. Wages, dividends, self-employment income, royalties and, in many countries, capital gains must also be reported.


  Deductions  

Deductions decrease tax liability. Tax deductions vary considerably among jurisdictions, but typical examples include contributions to retirement savings plans, alimony paid, and interest deductions on some loans. For businesses, most expenses directly related to business operations are deductible. Taxpayers may itemize deductions or use the standard deduction for their filing status. Once the subtraction of all deductions is complete, the taxpayer can determine their tax rate on their adjusted gross income (AGI).


  Tax Credits  

Tax credits are amounts that offset tax liabilities or the taxes owed. Like deductions, these vary widely among jurisdictions. However, there are often credits attributed to the care of dependent children and seniors, pensions, education, and many more.



After reporting income, deductions, and credits, the end of the return identifies the amount the taxpayer owes in taxes or the amount of tax overpayment. Overpaid taxes may be refunded or rolled into the next tax year. Taxpayers may remit payment as a single sum or schedule tax payments on a periodic basis. Similarly, most self-employed individuals may make advance payments every quarter to reduce their tax burden.






You can file a tax return by filling it out yourself, using a tax software program, or by hiring a tax preparer or accountant who will gather the required information from you and file it on your behalf.


   Special Considerations  

The IRS recommends that filers keep tax returns for at least three years. However, other factors may require more prolonged retention. Some situations may require indefinite retention of filed returns.



If a tax return contains errors, an amended return should be submitted to correct the discrepancy.
What Is Tax Season?  

Tax season is the time period, generally between Jan. 1 and April 15 of each year, when individual taxpayers traditionally prepare financial statements and reports for the previous year and submit their tax returns. In the U.S., individuals typically must file their annual tax return by April 15 of the year following any reportable earnings. Tax returns submitted after the end of tax season are subject to late penalty fees and interest charges.



The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has announced that the U.S. tax season begins on Monday, Jan. 23, 2023, which is when the IRS begins accepting and processing 2022 tax year returns. The deadline is April 18, 2023.





Key Takeaways


Tax season is when individuals and businesses prepare and file their income taxes.
In the United States, tax season is typically from Jan. 1 until the April 15 filing deadline, although Jan. 23, 2023, is when the IRS will begin accepting returns for the 2022 tax year.
During tax season, employers, financial custodians, and other entities that generate income for individuals must provide documentation and statements for tax preparation purposes to ensure taxes are filed on time.



   Understanding Tax Season  

Tax season is the period within which all income taxes must be filed up until the deadline. The deadline each year is typically April 15; however, if this date falls on a weekend or holiday, it is moved to the next business day. For instance, in 2023, April 15 is a Saturday, and the following business day, Monday, April 17, is Emancipation Day, so as a result, taxpayers have until Tuesday, April 18, 2023, to file their 2022 tax returns and pay any taxes due. Tax returns submitted after this date are subject to late penalty fees.






Emancipation Day commemorates the day President Abraham Lincoln signed the District of Columbia Compensated Emancipation Act in 1862. The Act freed 3,000 enslaved people in the area and has been observed in D.C. since 2005.



During tax season, businesses must furnish employees, contract laborers, and others, such as royalty earners, with tax documents specifying data required to complete an individual's tax returns. People who are required to file a tax return generally must do so before April 15 or request an extension.



Tax season is a busy period for many tax preparers and accounting professionals. The three-and-a-half-month period at the beginning of the year is the time when the necessary paperwork, including wage and earnings statements (such as 1099s or W-2s), is collected to assemble tax returns.



While some individuals calculate their own tax returns, many rely on the expertise of tax preparers and accounting professionals to be certain the paperwork is filed correctly and to improve the financial outcome of the tax return. An individual who earned $73,000 or less (in 2022) can file taxes for free through the IRS Free File program. Individuals must file federal, state, and, in some cases, local tax returns.






The IRS advises that all taxpayers keep copies of their prior-year tax returns for at least three years. In the event of an IRS audit, a taxpayer will be required to present the last three years of their documents. In extreme cases, such as suspicion of fraud, they will be expected to show seven years of documents.



For tax year 2022, according to the IRS, a taxpayer with gross income (all income from all sources) of more than $12,950 will have to pay federal tax. Independent contractors, or what the IRS refers to as "non-employee compensation," must file a return and pay self-employment taxes on any net earnings from self-employment of $400 or more.



The deadline for employers to file and send W-2s to employees is January 31. Businesses that hire independent contractors must send these nonemployees Form 1099-NEC as of the 2022 tax year. This form replaced 1099-MISC, which still remains in effect for payments made for things like rent, prizes, and healthcare, among others.


   Extensions  

Although the deadline to file your taxes is nearly always April 15, there are cases when the IRS may have to extend it. That was the case with the 2020 federal tax year. The agency extended the filing date for individuals until May 17, 2021, due to the coronavirus pandemic.



A further extension was granted to those living in Texas, Oklahoma, and Louisiana because of the winter storms that hit those states in February 2021. The deadline for individuals and corporations to file their 2020 tax returns was pushed to June 15, 2021.



Then the following spring storms caused enough damage to Tennessee as well as parts of Alabama and Kentucky to grant further extensions. The IRS often extends filing deadlines for disaster areas, which they have done already in 2023.


   Why Filing Early Can Make Sense  

Even though many taxpayers file their tax returns on or by about April 15 every year, there is no need to put it off until the last minute. Indeed, filing an early tax return can make sense for a variety of reasons.



The IRS began accepting and processing 2022 tax year returns on Monday, Jan. 23, 2023. Even if you don't file early, there are reasons to begin preparation as soon as you can.



Starting your filing process early gives you the time you need to collect the evidence needed to claim all of your deductions. You will avoid the headache of the middle of the night stress over figures and receipts. Your accountant will have a more flexible schedule and will probably be able to start working on your accounts immediately. Also, by filing early, you will short-circuit would-be identity thieves.




When Can You Start Filing Taxes for 2023?
In 2023, filing taxes for tax year 2022 begins on Monday, Jan. 23, 2023. Taxes are due by Tuesday, April 18, 2023.




Is the Tax Filing Deadline for 2023 Extended?
The tax filing deadline for 2023 has been extended for those in California, Alabama, and Georgia due to them being affected by disaster situations. The original extension was till May 15, 2023, but that has been extended to Oct. 16, 2023.




When Should I Receive My Tax Refund in 2023?
The IRS states that most tax refunds are distributed within 21 calendar days of filing.


   The Bottom Line  

Tax season is the period when individuals and businesses prepare their documents for filing taxes, which are generally due on April 15. Most individuals and businesses start receiving the needed documents to fill out their tax forms in January. Therefore, tax season is usually considered to be between Jan. 1 and April 15.



At this time, people fill out their taxes themselves, use tax software, or hire tax professionals. Whichever method is chosen, it's important to get taxes in by the due date so as to avoid penalties, fees, and interest charges.
What Is Tax Selling?  

Tax selling refers to a type of sale in which an investor sells an asset with a capital loss in order to lower or eliminate the capital gain realized by other investments, for income tax purposes. Tax selling allows the investor to avoid paying capital gains tax on recently sold or appreciated assets.





Key Takeaways

Tax selling is when an investor sells an asset at a capital loss in order to lower or eliminate the capital gain realized by other investments, for income tax purposes.A wash sale is when an investor sells an asset through a broker in order to realize a loss, but simultaneously repurchases the same asset from another broker within 30 days of the sale.The IRS prohibits wash sales.


   Understanding Tax Selling  

Tax selling involves selling stocks at a loss to reduce the capital gain earned on an investment. Since capital loss is tax-deductible, the loss can be used to offset any capital gains to reduce an investor’s tax liability.﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿



For example, let’s assume an investor has a $15,000 capital gain from the sale of ABC stock. They fall in the highest tax bracket and so will have to pay 20% capital gains tax, or $3,000, to the government.﻿﻿﻿﻿ But let's say they sell XYZ stock for a loss of $7,000. Their net capital gain for tax purposes will be $15,000 - $7,000 = $8,000, which means they'll have to pay only $1,600 in capital gains tax. Notice how the realized loss on XYZ reduces the gain on ABC and, hence, reduces the investor’s tax bill.



The tax-deductibility of losses might prompt investors to sell at a loss, deduct the loss, and then turn around and buy the same stock again in an effort to evade taxes, a practice known as a wash sale. When participating in tax selling, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) prohibits an investor from executing a wash sale.



Wash sales, to be specific, occur when an investor sells an asset through a broker in order to realize a loss, but simultaneously repurchases the same asset, or substantially identical asset, from another broker within 30 days of the sale. If a sell and buy security transaction is considered a "wash" by the IRS, the investor would not be allowed any tax benefits.﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿


   Tax Selling vs. Wash Sale  

Tax selling allows an investor to maintain their position while incurring a capital loss. In effect, wash sales are illegal, whereas tax selling is allowable. Tax selling typically involves investments with huge losses, which often means that these sales focus on a relatively small number of securities within the public markets. However, when a large number of sellers execute a sell order at the same time, the price of the securities falls.



After the selling season ends, shares that become extremely oversold have an opportunity to bounce back. In addition, the fact that tax selling often occurs in November and December as investors try to realize capital losses for the upcoming income tax season, could mean that the most attractive securities for tax selling are investments that are most likely to generate strong gains early in the next year.



A good strategy for investors, then, would be to buy during the tax selling episode and sell after the tax loss has been established. If investors would like to repurchase the shares sold for a loss, they can do so after the 30-day wash sale rule no longer applies. In addition, shares sold for a loss must have been in the investor's possession for more than 30 days.
What Is a Tax Shelter?  

A tax shelter is a vehicle used by individuals or organizations to minimize or decrease their taxable incomes and, therefore, tax liabilities. Tax shelters are legal, and can range from investments or investment accounts that provide favorable tax treatment, to activities or transactions that lower taxable income through deductions or credits. Common examples of tax shelter are employer-sponsored 401(k) retirement plans and municipal bonds.





Key Takeaways

A tax shelter is a place to legally store assets so that current or future tax liabilities are minimized.A tax shelter is a tax minimization strategy, and should not be confused with the illegal practice of tax evasion.Tax shelters may permanently reduce the amount of tax a taxpayer owes or may simply defer the taxes owed to a future period.A tax shelter is also different than a tax haven, as tax havens are often more secretive and less transparent.Qualified retirement accounts, certain insurance products, partnerships, municipal bonds, and real estate investments are all examples of potential tax shelters.


   Understanding Tax Shelters  

There are various provisions available that can be used to reduce an individual or corporation’s tax burden, whether temporarily or permanently. When these resources are implemented to lower a tax bill, we say that the entity involved is sheltering its taxes. The tax shelter route that is taken by a taxpayer to reduce or erase his tax liability can be legal or illegal, hence, it is imperative that the individual or corporation evaluate the tax reduction strategies to avoid being penalized by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).



There are numerous tax shelters that the government has provided to help its taxpayers lower the tax burden. Tax deductions, for one, are amounts of income earned that can be deducted from an individual’s taxable income. The tax rate that is applied to the lower taxable income will translate into a lower tax bill for the individual. Some tax shelters that are provided in the form of tax deductions include deduction of charitable contributions, student loan interest deduction, mortgage interest deduction, deduction for certain medical expenses, etc.



For example, the IRS permits charitable donations to be tax deductible for up to 50% of an individual’s adjusted gross income (AGI). If a taxpayer with an annual income of $82,000 elects to donate $12,000 to a qualified charitable organization, his taxable income will be reduced to $70,000. Since he falls in the 22% marginal tax bracket, he would lower his tax bill by $2,640 (12,000 x 22%).


   Types of Tax Shelters  
  Retirement Accounts  

Tax shelters are also legally available in the form of investment and retirement accounts which shelter income from taxes. The tax shelter provided through these accounts serves as an incentive to income earners to save for retirement. Income contributions made to a 401(k), 403(b), or Individual Retirement Account (IRA) plan will not be taxable until the individual retires. This way, money that would have been taxed by the IRS accrues interest and earnings in the account until the funds are drawn.



A taxpayer who takes advantage of the tax shelter provided through a 401(k), 403(b), or IRA reduces his taxable income by the amount of his contribution into either of the accounts. For individuals who expect to be in a higher income tax bracket by the time they retire, the Roth IRA and Roth 401(k) provide a way to shelter income from higher taxes.



With these investment accounts, the contributed income is taxed before entering the accounts, but no tax applies when the funds are withdrawn. This way, if the taxpayer starts making distributions after he enters a higher tax bracket, he would already have paid taxes when he was in a lower income bracket.






Weigh the option of paying tax now as opposed to paying more taxes later. For example, it may be better to pay taxes today on Roth IRA contributions to make sure those investments can grow tax-free.


  Foreign Investments  

Investors with foreign investments in their portfolios can take advantage of the foreign tax credit which applies to taxpayers who pay tax on their foreign investment income to a foreign government. The credit can be used by individuals, estates, or trusts to reduce their income tax liability.


  Oil and Energy  

To encourage investment in companies of certain sectors (oil exploration, renewable energy, and mining, for example) which require heavy capital investment and take several years to start making profits, the government allows the exploration costs incurred by these companies to be distributed to shareholders as tax deductions. The exploration and development costs are taken as the shareholders’ expenses; shareholders deduct the expenses from their taxable income as if they directly incurred these costs.


  Municipal Bonds  

Some municipal bonds are also tax-exempt, meaning that any interest income that is generated is exempt from federal income taxes, and in many cases, state and local income taxes as well.


  Mutual Funds  

Mutual funds that invest in government or municipal bonds are also common tax shelters. Though you still pay income tax on your initial investment when those dollars are earned, the interest generated by these debt securities is exempt from federal income taxes, so your investment generates annual income tax-free.


  Real Estate  

Physical real estate in addition to REIT vehicles may be used as a tax shelter. Taxpayers may receive favorable treatment due to depreciation deductions. Taxpayers may also receive benefits by performing 1031 like-kind exchanges that allow for the sale of a property and avoidance of capital gains of the proceeds are used to acquire a similar asset. Landlords and real estate investors may also be able to deduct rental losses from their rental income, thereby reducing their taxable income.


  Conservation Easements  

In some cases, agreements between landowners and a conservation organization can result in a tax benefit. These easements often reduce the use of land in order to protect a natural resource. When a taxpayer donates a conservation easement, they may be able to claim a tax deduction based on the value of the easement.


   Tax Shelter Strategies  

There are two primary strategies regarding tax shelters. First, taxpayers try to minimize their tax liability. This is done most often by minimizing taxable income by offsetting taxable income against taxable losses or by simply reducing taxable income. For tax avoidance strategies, the goal is to never pay that tax and avoid taxes altogether.



The other primary strategy regarding tax shelters is tax deferral. Consider popular retirement accounts such as a traditional IRA. The gains for a traditional IRA are taxable when withdrawn. However, those taxes are deferred to the future. Therefore, a taxpayer can plan for the future and not worry about immediate tax implications. Therefore, tax shelters may either reduce the amount of taxes due permanently or reduce the amount of taxes due temporarily.






IRS tax code changes every year. It is critical you consult your tax advisor when considering tax shelter strategies as your assumptions from one year may no longer be valid in the next.


   Tax Shelter vs. Tax Evasion  

While tax shelters provide a way to legally avoid taxes, they can also be used to evade taxes. Tax minimization (also referred to as tax avoidance) is a perfectly legal way to minimize taxable income and lower taxes payable. Do not confuse this with tax evasion, the illegal avoidance of taxes through misrepresentation or similar means.



If an investment is made for the sole purpose of avoiding or evading taxes, you could be forced to pay additional taxes and penalties. For example, if an independent contractor or subcontractor purposely transfers all or a portion of her earned income to another individual who is subject to lower tax rates, the contractor will be evading taxes.



Also, companies who take advantage of favorable tax rates in certain countries by creating offshore companies for the purpose of evading taxes, will be heavily penalized by the IRS which treats such manipulative strategies as fraudulent activity subject to steep fees, criminal prosecution, and prison sentence. (For related reading, see "Why Delaware Is Considered a Tax Shelter")


   Tax Shelter vs. Tax Haven  

Whereas a tax shelter is a legal strategy or investment vehicle designed to reduce or defer tax liabilities, a tax haven is a country or jurisdiction that offers low tax rates. A tax haven may also offer taxpayers minimal or no tax reporting requirements with coinciding financial privacy laws.



Tax havens are often used by individuals or businesses to avoid or evade taxes by hiding their income or assets in offshore accounts. Taxpayers often intentionally go out of their way to seek out tax havens, especially when considering where they may geographically live. Though tax shelters may accomplish some of the same outcomes as a tax haven, tax havens are often coupled with a lack of transparency and secrecy.




What Are the Best Ways to Shelter Money From Taxes?
The best way to shelter money from taxes is to seek deductions, credits, or tax-favorable investment vehicles. These three may either reduce your taxable income and resulting tax liability, or these may defer taxes to a future period. Most often, investors can leverage their company's 401(k) plan to generate investment earnings with tax deferred (or tax free) growth.




Is an LLC a Tax Shelter?
An LLC may be a tax shelter depending on prevailing tax brackets. Consider how the taxable income of an LLC may be assessed a rate as high as 21%. Should a sole proprietor earning the same revenue but be taxed at their individual marginal tax rate, they may pay a substantially higher rate.




How Do Wealthy Individuals Avoid Taxes?
The rich often avoid taxes in a few different ways. First, wealthy individuals may have high net worth, but they often strive to minimize net taxable income each year. This includes offsetting gains with losses, and this means avoiding large capital gains taxes for the disposal of assets. In some cases, individuals may simply take loans out with personal property as collateral to meet cashflow needs while not generating taxable income.




Are Tax Shelters Ethical?
Taxpayers must comply with IRS code; any deviation from tax law may result in fines or imprisonment. Some may feel that these tax avoidance strategies are unethical. However, taxpayers are often encouraged to deploy legal strategies that may include avoiding or deferring taxes. Because these strategies have been embedded in intentional tax law, tax shelters are ethical and not necessarily meant to be devious.


   The Bottom Line  

A tax shelter is a legal strategy or investment vehicle that is designed to reduce or defer tax liabilities. Tax shelters can be used by individuals, businesses, or organizations. Tax shelters take advantage of deductions, credits, or other incentives provided by the tax code and are different from tax evasion or tax havens.
What Is a Tax-Sheltered Annuity?  

A tax-sheltered annuity is a type of investment vehicle that lets an employee make pretax contributions into a retirement account from income. Because the contributions are pretax, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) does not tax the contributions and related benefits until the employee withdraws them from the plan.



Since the employer can also make direct contributions to the plan, the employee gains the benefit of having additional tax-free funds accruing.





Key Takeaways

A tax-sheltered annuity allows employees to invest income before taxes into a retirement plan.TSA plans are offered to employees of public schools and tax-exempt organizations.The IRS taxes the withdrawals, but not the contributions into the tax-sheltered annuity.Because employers can contribute to TSA plans, employees have the benefit of additional tax-free funds accruing.Charities, religious organizations, and other nonprofits can qualify to offer employees tax-sheltered annuities.


   Understanding a Tax-Sheltered Annuity  

In the U.S., one specific tax-sheltered annuity is the 403(b) plan. This plan provides employees of certain nonprofit and public education institutions with a tax-sheltered method of saving for retirement. There is usually a maximum amount that each employee can contribute to the plan, but sometimes there are catch-up provisions that allow employees to make additional contributions to make up for previous years when they did not maximize contributions.



The IRS caps contributions to TSAs at $20,500 for tax year 2022 (increasing to $22,500 for 2023), which is the same cap as 401(k) plans. TSAs also offer a catch-up provision for participants aged 50 or over, which totals $6,500 for tax year 2022 (and $7,500 for 2023).



Tax-sheltered annuities also include a lifetime catch-up for participants who have worked for a qualified organization for 15 years or more and whose average contribution level never exceeded $5,000 over that period. Including the contribution, catch-up provisions, and an employer match, the total contribution cannot exceed 100% of earnings up to a certain cap.



All qualified retirement plans require that withdrawals begin only after the age of 59½. Early withdrawals may be subject to a 10% IRS penalty unless certain exemptions apply. The IRS taxes withdrawals as ordinary income and requires them to start no later than the year the beneficiary turns 72, up from 70½ after the enactment of the Setting Every Community Up for Retirement Enhancement (SECURE) Act in 2019. Depending on the employer's or plan provider's provisions, employees may access funds before age 59½ via a loan. As with most qualified retirement plans, they may also permit withdrawals if the employee becomes disabled.


   TSAs vs. 401(k) Plans  

People often compare TSAs to 401(k) plans. The biggest similarity is that both plans represent specific sections of the Internal Revenue Code that establish qualifications for their use and their tax benefits. Both plans encourage individual savings by allowing for pretax contributions toward accumulating retirement savings on a tax-deferred basis.



From there, the two plans diverge. Notably, 401(k) plans are available to any eligible private sector employee who works for a company with a plan. TSA plans are reserved for employees of tax-exempt organizations and public schools. Nonprofit organizations that exist for charitable, religious, or educational purposes and are qualified under Section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code can offer TSA plans to employees.
What Is a Tax Shield?  

A tax shield is a reduction in taxable income for an individual or corporation achieved through claiming allowable deductions such as mortgage interest, medical expenses, charitable donations, amortization, and depreciation. These deductions reduce a taxpayer's taxable income for a given year or defer income taxes into future years. Tax shields lower the overall amount of taxes owed by an individual taxpayer or a business.





Key Takeaways

A tax shield allows an individual or corporation to reduce taxable income.Tax shields are achieved through claiming allowable deductions, such as mortgage interest, medical expenses, charitable donations, amortization, and depreciation.Tax shields lower the amount of taxes an individual or business taxpayer owes. 


   Understanding a Tax Shield  

The term "tax shield" references a particular deduction's ability to shield portions of the taxpayer’s income from taxation. Tax shields vary from country to country, and their benefits depend on the taxpayer's overall tax rate and cash flows for the given tax year.



For example, because interest payments on certain debts are a tax-deductible expense, taking on qualifying debts can act as tax shields. Tax-efficient investment strategies are cornerstones of investing for high net-worth individuals and corporations, whose annual tax bills can be very high.



Calculating the tax shield can be simplified by using this formula:



                     Tax Shield = Value of Tax-Deductible Expense x Tax Rate



So, for instance, if you have $1,000 in mortgage interest and your tax rate is 24%, your tax shield will be $240. 


   Tax Shields As Incentives  

The ability to use a home mortgage as a tax shield is a major benefit for many middle-class people whose homes are major components of their net worth. It also provides incentives to those interested in purchasing a home by providing a specific tax benefit to the borrower.



Student loan interest also functions as a tax shield in the same manner. So, you could say that taking on debt has a tax benefit because you can use the interest as a tax-deductible expense.


   Tax Shields for Medical Expenses  

Taxpayers who have paid more in medical expenses than covered by the standard deduction can choose to itemize in order to gain a larger tax shield. An individual may deduct any amount attributed to medical or dental expenses that exceeds 7.5% of adjusted gross income by filing Schedule A.


   Tax Shields for Charitable Giving  

Similar to the tax shield offered in compensation for medical expenses, charitable giving can also lower a taxpayer’s obligations. In order to qualify, the taxpayer must use itemized deductions on their tax return. The deductible amount may be as high as 60% of the taxpayer’s adjusted gross income, depending on the specific circumstances. For donations to qualify, they must be given to an approved organization.


   Tax Shields for Depreciation  

The depreciation deduction allows taxpayers to recover certain losses associated with the depreciation of qualifying property. The deduction can apply to tangible property, such as vehicles and buildings, as well as to intangible assets, such as computer software and patents.



In order to qualify, the depreciation must be associated with an asset used in a business or income-generating activity, and have an expected lifespan of more than one year. Other conditions may affect the ability for depreciation to be deductible, including, but not limited to, the duration of ownership of the asset and whether the asset was used to build capital improvements.




What Is the Formula for Tax Shield?
 The formula for tax shield is, Tax Shield = Value of Tax-Deductible Expense x Tax Rate.




Is Tax Shield the Same as Tax Savings?
Tax shields result in tax savings. Tax shields allow for taxpayers to make deductions to their taxable income, which reduces their taxable income. The lower the taxable income, the lower the amount of taxes owed to the government, hence, tax savings for the taxpayer.




What Is a Tax Shield Example?
A common example of a tax shield is mortgage interest. A person buys a house with a mortgage and pays interest on that mortgage. That interest is tax deductible, which is offset against the person's taxable income. This then reduces their overall tax burden.


   The Bottom Line  

Tax shields allow taxpayers to reduce the amount of taxes owed by lowering their taxable income. When filing your taxes, ensure you are taking these deductions so that you can save money when tax season arrives.
What Is a Tax Table?  

The term tax table refers to a chart that displays the amount of tax due based on income received. Tax tables are provided by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to help taxpayers determine how much tax they owe and how to calculate it when they file their annual tax returns. The IRS provides different tax ranges in the tax table by tax filing status. Tax rates may be shown as a discrete amount, a percentage rate, or a combination of both. Tax tables are used by individuals, companies, and estates for both standard income and capital gains. They are updated annually.

A tax table is a chart that displays the amount of tax due based on income received.The IRS provides tax tables to help taxpayers determine how much tax they owe and how to calculate it when they file their annual tax returns.Tax tables are divided by income ranges and filing status. Tax tables are commonly used by individual and corporate taxpayers with modest income levels while high-income earners use more detailed tax rate schedules.Tax tables are updated by the IRS every year. 


   How Tax Tables Work  

Business and individual taxpayers pay an effective tax rate on their income every year. The tax paid by each entity depends on a number of factors, such as:



Filing status (single, married filing separately, married filing jointly, or head of household)
Applicable tax deductions and credits
Exemptions
The amount of income earned in a given tax year



Based on these factors and the tax rates set for the year, taxpayers and taxing authorities can determine the amount of tax to be paid by each taxpayer.



A typical tax table shows breakpoint income levels, above and below which different tax rates will apply. But the income used in tax tables is taxable income—not the gross income. Taxable income refers to gross income minus deductions. Thus, only the dollar amount left after factoring in deductions is subject to income tax.



For example, the standard deduction for 2022 is $12,950 for single taxpayers ($13,850 for 2023).A taxpayer who earns $65,000 for the year and only qualifies for the standard deduction pays income tax on $52,050 ($65,000 - $12,950) in 2022. Generally speaking, the higher a taxpayer’s taxable income, the more they are taxed.



Tax tables are set up with different columns for each filing status and rows of various taxable income amounts on the left. A person's tax liability can be traced on the table based on their tax filing status and the amount transferred to the individual's income tax form.






Qualifying widows or widowers can use the married filing jointly category for at least two years following the death of their spouses.


   Special Considerations  

Tax tables are commonly used by individual and corporate taxpayers with modest income levels. High-income earners tend to use more detailed tax rate schedules in conjunction with itemized deductions.



Most states use tax tables to determine personal income tax. The states that do not assess personal income tax are Alaska, Florida, Nevada, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Washington, and Wyoming. New Hampshire only assesses a tax on dividend and interest income.



As noted above, tax tables change from year to year and vary from state to state. Investors should always be sure that they use the correct tax tables based on their income sources and area of residence.


   Example of a Tax Table  

As noted above, the IRS provides updated tax and earned credit tables each year. It provides a tax range based on income levels and divides the amount owed based on your tax filing status.



The following is the tax table for taxpayers who fall in the $46,000 taxable income range for 2022:

What Is the Tax-to-GDP Ratio?  

A tax-to-GDP ratio is a gauge of a nation's tax revenue relative to the size of its economy as measured by gross domestic product (GDP). The ratio provides a useful look at a country's tax revenue because it reveals potential taxation relative to the economy. It also enables a view of the overall direction of a nation's tax policy, as well as international comparisons between the tax revenues of different countries.





Key Takeaways

The tax-to-GDP ratio is a measure of a nation's tax revenue relative to the size of its economy.This ratio is used with other metrics to determine how well a nation's government directs its economic resources via taxation.Developed nations typically have higher tax-to-GDP ratios than developing nations.Higher tax revenues mean a country is able to spend more on improving infrastructure, health, and education—keys to the long-term prospects for a country’s economy and people.According to the World Bank, tax revenues above 15% of a country’s gross domestic product (GDP) are a key ingredient for economic growth and, ultimately, poverty reduction.


   Understanding the Tax-to-GDP Ratio  

Taxes are a critical measure of a nation’s development and governance. The tax-to-GDP ratio is used to determine how well a nation's government directs its economic resources. Higher tax revenues mean a country is able to spend more on improving infrastructure, health, and education—keys to the long-term prospects for a country’s economy and people.


  Tax Policy and Economic Development  

According to the World Bank, tax revenues above 15% of a country’s gross domestic product (GDP) are a key ingredient for economic growth and, ultimately, poverty reduction. This level of taxation ensures that countries have the money necessary to invest in the future and achieve sustainable economic growth. Developed countries generally have a far higher ratio. The average among members of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development was 33.8% in 2019.



According to one theory, as economies become more developed and incomes rise, people generally begin to demand more services from the government, whether in healthcare, public transportation, or education. This would explain, for example, why the tax-to-GDP ratio in 2019 in the European Union, at an average of 41.4%, is so much higher than in Asia-Pacific, where tax-to-GDP ratios ranged from 11.9% in Indonesia to 35.4% in Nauru (and the majority of countries did not have a ratio as high as the OECD average of 33.8%).


   The Direction of Tax Policy  

Policymakers use the tax-to-GDP ratio to compare tax receipts from year to year because it offers a better measure of the rise and fall in tax revenue than simple amounts. Tax revenues are closely related to economic activity, rising during periods of faster economic growth and declining during recessions. As a percentage, tax revenues generally rise and fall faster than GDP, but the ratio should stay relatively consistent barring extreme swings in growth.



However, in cases of significant shifts in tax law or during severe economic downturns, the ratio can shift dramatically. For example, according to the OECD, the U.S.'s tax-to-GDP ratio fell more than any other OECD member in 2018. This was mostly a result of the $1.5 trillion tax cut signed by former President Donald Trump in 2017.



The tax-to-GDP ratio in the United States has decreased from 28.3% in 2000 to 24.5% in 2019. Over the same period, the OECD average in 2019 was slightly above that in 2000 (33.8% compared with 33.3%).



The United States ranked 32nd out of 37 OECD countries in terms of the tax-to-GDP ratio in 2019.






Among policymakers and economists, there has never been a consensus on the best tax policy for economic growth. On one side are those who believe increasing tax rates will generate desperately needed revenue and solve the ballooning U.S. debt problem. Conversely, there are those who believe that raising taxes is a bad idea and that lower rates increase revenues by stimulating the economy.


   Tax to GDP Ratio FAQs  
  What Is a Tax-to-GDP Ratio?  

The tax-to-GDP ratio is the ratio of the tax revenue of a country compared to the country’s gross domestic product (GDP). This ratio is used as a measure of how well the government controls a country's economic resources. Tax-to-GDP ratio is calculated by dividing the tax revenue of a specific time period by the GDP.


  Does GDP Include Tax Revenue?  

Tax revenue includes revenues collected from taxes on income and profits, social security contributions, taxes levied on goods and services, payroll taxes, and taxes on the ownership and transfer of property. Total tax revenue is considered part of a country's GDP. As a percentage of GDP, total tax revenue indicates the share of a country's output that is collected by the government through taxes.


  What Is a Good Tax-to-GDP Ratio?  

A tax-to-GDP ratio of 15% or higher ensures economic growth and, thus, poverty reduction in the long-term, according to the World Bank.



The tax-to-GDP ratio in the United States has decreased from 28.3% in 2000 to 24.5% in 2019. 


  How Do I Graph Tax Revenue as a Percentage of GDP?  

The World Bank provides line graphs that reflect tax revenue as a percentage of GDP from 1972 to 2019 for selected countries and economies. The values on the horizontal axis (x-axis) are years. The values on the vertical axis (y-axis) reflect the percentage (of tax revenue compared to GDP). The plotted data points reveal the change over time in these values.


  Do Tax Revenue and GDP Have a Direct Relationship?  

Changes in the level of taxation in a country or an economy also impact its level of economic activity (and therefore, its GDP). Extensive research has been conducted on the relationship between tax policy, jobs, and economic growth by government departments and agencies, think tanks, and researchers in academia and the private sector.



The central question this research aims to answer is: Do tax rates result in economic growth or economic contraction (more jobs vs. fewer jobs)? GDP is usually considered the best measure of economic growth, specifically real GDP (which is an inflation-adjusted measure of GDP).



Tax rates for an American family with an average income have remained fairly stable over the long term. For example, it was around 21% in 1947 and stayed around there until the mid-1960s, when it dropped to between 16% and 19%. Rates stayed in the 16% to 19% range from the mid-1960s to the mid-1990s, approximately. From 2002 to 2015, the rate remained around 15.5%. In 1947, U.S. GDP was $243 billion. By 2017, U.S. GDP had climbed to approximately $18,905 billion, despite tax rates remaining fairly stable during this time period.



In addition, there were approximately 11 recessionary periods during this timeframe. From this perspective, tax rates on the average American family did not impact GDP in a meaningful way during this time period.



While it is true that either increasing or decreasing taxes (and tax revenues) has an impact on economic growth, there are clearly other factors that contribute more to the direction of the economy (including, but not limited to, interest rates set by the Federal Reserve and broader technological advancements in the workforce).


  Where Does the United States Rank in Terms of Tax Revenue as a Percentage of GDP?  

The United States ranked 32nd out of 37 OECD countries in terms of the tax-to-GDP ratio in 2019. In 2019, the United States had a tax-to-GDP ratio of 24.5% (the OECD average in 2019 was 33.8%). In 2018, the United States had the same ranking: 32nd out of the 37 OECD countries in terms of the tax-to-GDP ratio.


  Which Countries Have the Highest and the Lowest Tax Burdens as a Percentage of GDP?  

France has the highest tax burden as a percentage of GDP, at 46.2%. Denmark (46%), Belgium (44.6%), Sweden (44%), and Finland (43.3%) also have very high tax-to GDP ratios. Kuwait has the lowest tax burdens as a percentage of GDP, at 1.4%.


  Where Does the U.S. Rank As Far as Corporate Tax Revenue as a Percentage of GDP?  

Compared to other comparable economies, the U.S. collects fewer tax revenues. For example, in 2019, U.S. corporate tax revenues accounted for just 1% of GDP. Among the Group of 7 (G7) countries—Japan (4.2%), Canada (3.8%), the U.K. (2.5%), France (2.2%), Germany (2.0%), and Italy (1.9%)—U.S. corporate income tax revenue is the lowest., at 1%. The G7 countries are an informal grouping of wealthy democracies; the heads of government of these states (plus representatives of the European Union) meet at the annual G7 Summit.



In the late 1960s, the rate of U.S. federal corporate taxes reached its high. Since then, it has been on a decline. In fact, the current tax rate for corporations is less than half the size it was in the 1950s and 60s.


  Can Raising Taxes Help the Economy?  

In the short term (the next one or two years), cutting taxes is an effective way to boost demand in an economy. This is because consumers have more disposable income and businesses have more money to hire employers and invest in their business. Tax cuts increase worker's take-home pay. Tax cuts also increase firms’ after-tax cash flow. Businesses can use this extra cash flow to pay dividends and expand activity, and it can make hiring and investing more attractive. Tax increases have the opposite effect.



In the long term, tax reductions can induce people to work more, bring more low-skilled workers into the labor force,  encourage saving, cause companies to invest domestically (rather than internationally), and encourage the creation of new ideas through research. However, tax reductions in the long term can also slow economic growth by increasing deficits. In addition, if tax cuts increase workers’ after-tax income, they may choose to work less, and this can negatively impact supply.



It is hard to analyze how raising taxes impacts the economy because policy changes never happen in a vacuum—there are a multiplicity of factors that contribute to economic growth (or the opposite), so it is hard to isolate the effects of raising (or lowering) taxes. However, historical data reveals that higher taxes are compatible with economic growth and job creation. If policymakers use the revenue from tax increases on reducing budget deficits, it can be very positive for the economy.
What Is a Tax Treaty?  

A tax treaty is a bilateral (two-party) agreement made by two countries to resolve issues involving double taxation of passive and active income of each of their respective citizens. Income tax treaties generally determine the amount of tax that a country can apply to a taxpayer's income, capital, estate, or wealth. ﻿﻿ An income tax treaty is also called a Double Tax Agreement (DTA).﻿﻿



Some countries are seen as being tax havens. Generally, a tax haven is a country or a place with low or no corporate taxes that allow foreign investors to set up businesses there. Tax havens typically do not enter into tax treaties.





Key Takeaways

A tax treaty is a bilateral (two-party) agreement made by two countries to resolve issues involving double taxation of passive and active income of each of their respective citizens.When an individual or business invests in a foreign country, the issue of which country should tax the investor’s earnings may arise.Both countries may enter into a tax treaty to agree on which country should tax the investment income to prevent the same income from getting taxed twice.Some countries are seen as being tax havens; these countries typically do not enter into tax treaties.


   How a Tax Treaty Works  

When an individual or business invests in a foreign country, the issue of which country should tax the investor’s earnings may arise. Both countries–the source country and the residence country–may enter into a tax treaty to agree on which country should tax the investment income to prevent the same income from getting taxed twice.



The source country is the country that hosts the inward investment. The source country is also sometimes referred to as the capital-importing country. The residence country is the investor's country of residence. The residence country is also sometimes referred to as the capital-exporting country.



To avoid double taxation, tax treaties may follow one of two models: The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Model and the United Nations (UN) Model Convention.﻿﻿ ﻿﻿


   OECD Tax Treaty Model vs. UN Tax Treaty Model  

The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) is a group of 37 countries with a drive to promote world trade and economic progress.﻿﻿ ﻿﻿



The OECD Tax Convention on Income and on Capital is more favorable to capital-exporting countries than capital-importing countries. It requires the source country to give up some or all of its tax on certain categories of income earned by residents of the other treaty country.﻿﻿



The two involved countries will benefit from such an agreement if the flow of trade and investment between the two countries is reasonably equal and the residence country taxes any income exempted by the source country.



The second tax treaty model is formally referred to as the United Nations Model Double Taxation Convention between Developed and Developing Countries. The UN is an international organization that seeks to increase political and economic cooperation amongst its member countries.



A treaty that follows the UN's model gives favorable taxing rights to the foreign country of investment. Typically, this favorable taxing scheme benefits developing countries receiving inward investment. It gives the source country increased taxing rights over the business income of non-residents compared to the OECD Model Convention.﻿﻿ The United Nations Model Convention draws heavily from the OECD Model Convention.﻿﻿


   Withholding Taxes Policy  

One of the most important aspects of a tax treaty is the treaty's policy on withholding taxes because it determines how much tax is levied on any income earned (interest and dividends) from securities owned by a non-resident.﻿﻿



For example, if a tax treaty between country A and country B determines that their bilateral withholding tax on dividends is 10%, then country A will tax dividend payments that are going to country B at a rate of 10%, and vice versa.



The U.S. has tax treaties with multiple countries that help to reduce—or eliminate—the tax paid by residents of foreign countries. These reduced rates and exemptions vary among countries and specific items of income.



Under these same treaties, residents or citizens of the U.S. are taxed at a reduced rate, or are exempt from foreign taxes, on certain items of income they receive from sources within foreign countries. Tax treaties are said to be reciprocal because they apply in both treaty countries.



Income tax treaties typically include a clause, referred to as a "saving clause," that is intended to prevent residents of the U.S. from taking advantage of certain parts of the tax treaty in order to avoid taxation of a domestic source of income.



For individuals that are residents of countries that do not have tax treaties with the U.S., any source of income that is earned within the U.S. is taxed in the same way and at the same rates shown in the instructions for the applicable U.S. tax return.



For individuals who are residents of the U.S., it is important to keep in mind that some individual states within the U.S. do not honor the provisions of tax treaties. ﻿﻿
What Is a Tax Wedge?  

A tax wedge is the difference between before-tax and after-tax wages. The tax wedge measures how much the government ostensibly receives as a result of taxing the labor force.



Tax wedge may also refer to the market inefficiency that is created when a tax is imposed on a good or service. The tax causes the supply and demand equilibrium to shift, creating a wedge of dead weight losses.





Key Takeaways

The tax wedge is the net difference in gross income and net income after taxes have been deducted.In progressive tax systems, the tax wedge increases on a marginal basis as income increases.Economists propose that a tax wedge creates market inefficiencies by artificially shifting the true price of labor as well as goods and services.


   Understanding the Tax Wedge  

Many employees have taxes withheld from their paychecks, which means their take home pay is less than the gross salary or wage or the cost of employing them. The tax wedge is the difference between what employees take home in earnings and what it costs to employ them (labor cost), or the dollar measure of the income tax rate. The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) defines a tax wedge as the ratio between the amount of taxes paid by an average single worker (a single person at 100% of average earnings) without children and the corresponding total labour cost for the employer.﻿﻿ Some argue that the tax wedge on investment income will also reduce savings, and ultimately lower living standards.



The decrease in net income may lead to employees making a decision not to work as much or to find other ways to keep more of the income (by using government benefits, for example). While applications for government benefits rise, the workforce suffers as the employees who remain demand higher salaries, causing employers to decrease their hiring rate.


   Example of the Tax Wedge  

In some countries, the tax wedge increases as employee income increases. This reduces the marginal benefit of working; therefore, employees will often work less hours than they would if no tax was imposed. Thus, a tax wedge might be calculated to determine how higher payroll taxes ultimately affect hiring.



For example, assume an employee’s gross income is $75,000 and he falls in the 15% and 5% tax brackets for federal and state income tax, respectively. His net income will be $75,000 x 0.80 = $60,000. In a progressive tax system, at some point, income taxes are increased at both federal and state levels to 25% and 8%, respectively. Tax withheld from gross income is now $24,750, and net income is $75,000 - $24,750 (or $75,000 multiplied by 0.67) = $50,250.


   Tax Wedge and Market Inefficiency  

A tax wedge can also be used to calculate the percentage of market inefficiency introduced by sales taxes. When a good or service is taxed, the equilibrium price and quantity shifts. The resulting price or quantity which deviates from the equilibrium is known as the tax wedge. The market inefficiency that results from a tax wedge will cause the consumer to pay more and the producer to receive less for the good than they did before the tax, due to higher equilibrium prices paid by consumers and lower equilibrium quantities sold by producers. In effect, the sales tax effectively drives a "wedge" between the price consumers pay and the price producers receive for a product.
What Is Taxable Income?  

Taxable income is the portion of your gross income used to calculate how much tax you owe in a given tax year. It can be described broadly as adjusted gross income (AGI) minus allowable itemized or standard deductions. Taxable income includes wages, salaries, bonuses, and tips, as well as investment income and various types of unearned income.





Key Takeaways

Taxable income is the portion of your gross income that the IRS deems subject to taxes.It consists of both earned and unearned income.Taxable income comes from compensation, businesses, partnerships, and royalties, among others.Taxable income is generally less than adjusted gross income because of deductions that reduce it.You can begin calculating your taxable income by determining your filing status and gathering the documents related to all your income sources.

   Understanding Taxable Income  

Taxable income consists of both earned and unearned income. Unearned income that is considered taxable includes canceled debts, government benefits (such as unemployment benefits and disability payments), strike benefits, and lottery payments. Taxable income also includes earnings generated from appreciated assets that have been sold during the year and from dividends and interest income.



When it comes to deductions, the IRS offers individual tax filers the option to claim the standard deduction or a list of itemized deductions. Itemized deductions include interest paid on mortgages, medical expenses exceeding a specific threshold (7.5% of your AGI), and a range of other expenses.



When businesses file their taxes, they do not report their revenue directly as taxable income. Rather, they subtract their business expenses from their revenue to calculate their business income. Then, they subtract deductions to calculate their taxable income.






Tax brackets and marginal tax rates are based on taxable income, not gross income.



   Sources of Taxable Income  

Taxable income is any income you earn during the tax year. The most common is employee compensation. But there are other sources of income that are taxable.


  Employee Compensation  

As noted above, this is the most common type of taxable income. This comes in the form of salaries and wages, tips, bonuses, and fees that are paid to you by your employer. The income is reported to you on your W-2, which the company sends out to you by mail. This form also includes any applicable deductions to your taxable income, such as income tax, Social Security, Medicare, and 401(k) contributions, among others.



According to the IRS, people who provide child care either in their own homes or elsewhere must include the amount they receive as taxable income. This rule also applies to any money you receive if you babysit.



If you receive certain fringe benefits as a director, partner, or through your employer, you must include their value, too. The IRS has a full list of what's taxable and exemptions on its website.


  Income From Business and Investments  

You are responsible for declaring any income you earn from certain types of business and investment activity. This includes any rental income you receive from properties that you earn. It doesn't matter if the rental activity you receive is the result of a business, or if you earn it for a profit. Keep in mind that you may be able to declare the expenses related to the rental, which can offset the income you receive.


  Income from Partnerships  

The IRS doesn't tax partnership entities but any income, deductions, and losses that stem from these entities are passed through to individual partners. As such, the partnership doesn't pay taxes. If you're a partner, you must declare any pass-throughs on your annual tax return. This must occur even if the pass-through doesn't apply to you directly.


  Income from S Corporations  

Just like a partnership, this type of corporation doesn't pay any income tax on earnings. This is passed through to shareholders based on their ownership stake in the S corporation. if you're a shareholder, earnings, losses, and deductions are reported on your personal income tax return.


  Other Sources  

Bartering: Bartering involves an exchange of goods and services rather than cash. So if you fix the electrical system in someone's home and they pay you with a similar service (like fixing your plumbing) rather than cash, the value of that service is considered taxable income.
Digital Currencies: Activities related to these alternative currencies are considered taxable income. You must declare anything related to the sale, exchange, or investment of digital currencies like Bitcoin.
Royalties: You must also declare royalties as taxable income that you earn on intellectual property (copyrights, patents, trademarks, etc.) and oil, gas, and mineral properties.


   How to Calculate Taxable Income  

Here's a step-by-step guide to calculating taxable income.


  Step 1: Determine Your Filing Status  

To calculate your taxable income for an individual tax return, you first need to determine your filing status. If you are unmarried, you can file your taxes either as a single filer or, if you have a qualifying person for whom you pay more than half of the support and housing costs as head of household (HOH).



If you are married, you will most likely want to file as married filing jointly. However, there are some limited instances when it may make sense to file as married filing separately.


  Step 2: Gather Documents for all Sources of Income  

When you know your filing status, you will need to gather documents for all sources of income for yourself, your spouse (if applicable), and any dependents (if applicable). The total of all these sources of income is known as your gross income. Below are the most common tax forms that you will need in order to calculate your gross income.



Form W-2 shows the income you earned through services performed as an employee.
If you worked a contract job or side gig, then you will need a Form 1099-NEC (nonemployee compensation). It reports income earned while working for a non-employer person or entity (when those amounts are greater than $600).
Form 1099-MISC reports amounts earned (greater than $600) from other income sources, including rents, prizes, fishing boat proceeds, or crop insurance payments.
If you earned more than $10 in interest during the tax year, then you will receive a Form 1099-INT from your financial institution.


  Step 3: Calculate Your Adjusted Gross Income (AGI)  

The next step is to calculate your AGI. Your AGI is the result of taking certain “above-the-line” adjustments to your gross income, such as contributions to a qualifying individual retirement account (IRA), student loan interest, and certain education expenses.



These items are referred to as “above the line” because they reduce your income before taking any allowable itemized deductions or standard deductions.


  Step 4: Calculate Your Deductions (Standard or Itemized)  

The next step is to calculate your deductions. As mentioned above, you can either take the standard deduction or itemize your deductions.



The standard deduction is a set amount that tax filers can claim if they don’t have enough itemized deductions to claim. For the 2022 tax year, individual tax filers can claim a $12,950 standard deduction ($13,850 for 2023) or $19,400 ($20,800 for 2023) if they are heads of households. For those who are married filing jointly, the standard deduction is $25,900 ($27,700 for 2023).



If you plan to itemize deductions rather than take the standard deduction, these are the records most commonly needed:



Property taxes and mortgage interest paid. This typically appears on a Form 1098, Mortgage Interest Statement, which you will receive from your mortgage lender. If you have no mortgage or do not have an escrow account paying your property taxes, then you will need to keep a record of your property tax payments separately.
State and local taxes paid. This is on the W-2 form if you work for an employer. If you are an independent contractor, then you will need a record of the estimated taxes you made quarterly throughout the year.
Charitable donations. Charitable donations are a tax-deductible expense, but the amount you can claim is limited to a percentage of your AGI in most years.
Educational expenses. Be aware that if you pay qualified higher-education expenses with a student loan, then they must be claimed in the year when the expenses are made, not in the year when the loan proceeds are received or repaid.
Unreimbursed medical bills. You can deduct the amount of unreimbursed medical expenses that exceed 7.5% of your AGI (the threshold is typically between 7.5% and 10% of AGI in any normal tax year).



Owners of sole proprietorships, partnerships, S corporations, and some trusts and estates may be eligible for a qualified business income (QBI) deduction, which allows eligible taxpayers to deduct up to 20% of QBI, real estate investment trust (REIT) dividends, and qualified publicly traded partnership (PTP) income. If you are an independent contractor, then your work will most likely qualify for this special deduction.


  Step 5: Calculate Taxable Income  

For the final step in calculating your taxable income, you will need to take your AGI, calculated above, and subtract all applicable deductions.






As part of the American Rescue Plan, student loan forgiveness issued from Jan. 1, 2021, to Dec. 31, 2025, will not be taxable to the recipient.


   Taxable Income vs. Nontaxable Income  

The IRS considers almost every type of income to be taxable, but a small number of income streams are nontaxable. For example, if you are a member of a religious organization who has taken a vow of poverty, work for an organization run by that order, and turn your earnings over to the order, then your income is nontaxable.



Similarly, if you receive an employee achievement award, then its value is not taxable as long as certain conditions are met. If someone dies and you receive a life insurance payment, then that is nontaxable income as well.



Different tax agencies define taxable and nontaxable income differently. For example, while the IRS considers lottery winnings to be taxable income in the United States, the Canada Revenue Agency considers most lottery winnings and other unexpected one-time windfalls to be nontaxable.




What Does Taxable Income Mean?
The term taxable income refers to any gross income earned that is used to calculate the amount of tax you owe. Put simply, it is your adjusted gross income less any deductions. This includes any wages, tips, salaries, and bonuses from employers. Investment and unearned income are also included.




What Is Unearned Income?
Examples of unearned income subject to taxation by federal or state authorities include interest, dividends, and rents, along with capital gains. Other forms of taxable income can derive from loans that have been forgiven, government benefits (like disability or unemployment benefits), and winnings from casinos or lotteries.




How Is Taxable Income Calculated?
Taxable income is calculated by adding up all sources of income, excluding nontaxable items, and subtracting credits and deductions.




What Is Nontaxable Income?
Examples of nontaxable income include earnings made from a religious or charitable organization that are subsequently returned to that organization. Another example can be an employee achievement award, as long as certain conditions are met. If someone dies and you receive a life insurance benefit, that is also nontaxable income (although it may subject you to an estate tax).




How Do I Lower My Taxable Income?
Ending the year with a taxable income can put you into a higher tax bracket, which means you'll have a higher tax bill. Most people lower this figure by taking the standard deduction when you file your return. Or, if you itemize, make sure you factor in every deduction possible. But there are ways to lower your taxable income even before you file. Contributing to a retirement account like a 401(k) or an individual retirement account, setting money aside in a flexible spending or health savings account.


   The Bottom Line  

Income is any compensation you receive for providing a service. The most common form is, of course, money. But what most people don't realize is that there are other forms of income, including property and services in-kind. And all of these are taxable. Knowing what to include can make filing your taxes easy and hassle-free. To avoid any complications, use the information and tips above to ensure that you calculate and declare your taxable income accurately.
What Is the Taxable Wage Base?  

The term taxable base refers to the maximum amount of earned income on which employees must pay Social Security taxes. The employee's gross wages are generally equal to the taxable wage base. An employer typically handles this calculation and withholds the correct amount of taxes from each of the employee's paychecks. Meanwhile, the employee is still responsible for reporting the tax on their tax return each year. The taxable wage base is also known as the Social Security wage base.





Key Takeaways

The taxable wage base is the maximum amount of earned income on which employees must pay Social Security taxes.The taxable wage base is also known as the Social Security wage base.The maximum amount of income that taxpayers must pay Social Security tax on is $147,000 in 2022 and $160,200 in 2023.Half of the Social Security tax is paid by the employer, while half is paid by the employee.Some state unemployment agencies use a taxable wage base to calculate unemployment taxes.


   Understanding the Taxable Wage Base  

The Social Security tax rate is 12.4%. Half of the tax, which comes to 6.2%, is paid by the employer, and the employee is responsible for paying the other half through payroll deductions. But Social Security tax is applied to earnings only up to a certain limit. Wages, salaries, and bonuses in excess of the stipulated maximum amount of earnings are not taxable. The limit adjusts annually, pegged to changes in the national average wage index.



The maximum amount of income that is subject to Social Security taxes is $147,000 in 2022 and $160,200 in 2023. This means that you don't pay Social Security taxes on any amount over these thresholds. The Social Security tax is deducted from individuals' payroll automatically along with the Medicare tax. Keep in mind that although the Social Security tax is applied up to the taxable wage base, the Medicare tax of 2.9% has no such limit. Therefore, it is applied to 100% of an employee's income.



An employee's taxable wage base is reported on their W-2 form (the Wage and Tax Statement) each year. Employers prepare the W-2s annually, sending copies to both the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and the employee. Box 3 ("Social security wages") on the 2022 form essentially gives your taxable wage base, detailing how much of an individual's earnings are subject to Social Security tax. Box 4 indicates the amount of Social Security tax withheld.






If you're self-employed, you're responsible for paying the employee and employer's portion of the Social Security and Medicare tax to the IRS.


   Special Considerations  

The taxes that are taken out of Social Security wages go to fund the Social Security payments that millions receive each month. The best-known of these is the retirement benefits paid to those 65 years old and up. Here's a snapshot of how many individuals receive each different benefit through the Social Security program as of June 2022:



About 48 million of these retired workers and an additional 2.8 million dependents received an average of $1,669 each month.As many as 7.8 million disabled workers and their 1.3 million dependents also receive Social Security benefit checks averaging $1,362 per month.Survivors of deceased retired or disabled workers are entitled to all or some benefits. There are 5.9 million Americans in this group, receiving a collective $7.8 billion.






Social Security tax and Medicare tax are collectively known as Federal Insurance Contributions Act (FICA) taxes. The 7.65% of gross income that an employee pays toward them appears as FICA taxes on their paystub and on their annual W-2 form.


   Taxable Wage Base and Unemployment Tax  

A taxable wage base is most often used in reference to Social Security taxes, though it can also apply to any income-based tax. For example, some state unemployment agencies use a taxable wage base to calculate unemployment taxes. The following is a list of taxable wage bases to calculate unemployment insurance in 2023 in several states:



Alaska: $47,100California: $7,000Florida: $7,000Kentucky: $11,100Nevada: $40,100New York: $12,300Ohio: $9,000Pennsylvania: $10,000Wyoming: $29,100



Like the taxable wage base for Social Security, the unemployment tax basis increases every year or every few years, depending on the state.






In some instances, an employee earns wages that are classified as excess wages. The excess wage can be subtracted from gross income so that the taxable wage base is lower than gross income.


   Taxable Wage Base Exemptions  

Not every part of an individual's income is considered taxable. As such, even if they are included in a paycheck, some common types of compensation are exempt from the taxable wage base, either completely or within limits. They include:



Payments to partners of a partnership
Disabled worker wages
Workers' compensation benefits
Compensation paid to family employees who are minors
Life insurance coverage
Business travel expenses
Assistance for dependent care, education, retirement planning services
Payments to certain non-employees
Tips under $20 a month






The COVID-related Tax Relief Act of 2020 deferred the due date for the withholding and payment of the employee share of Social Security tax on Q4 wages until the period beginning on Jan. 1, 2021, and ending on Dec. 31, 2021. This applied to employees whose Social Security wages for a biweekly pay period were less than $4,000.


   Examples of Taxable Wage Base  

The following are two examples of the taxable wage base and how Social Security taxes are calculated. We've used the 2022 taxable wage base.



Let's say Rob earns $85,000 in gross income and has a 6.2% Social Security tax withheld from his pay. The federal government, in effect, will collect $5,270 (6.2% x $85,000) from Rob to help fund retirement and disability benefits for retirees.



Now let's look at Sue's situation. Suppose she earns $175,000 gross income. The Social Security tax rate will only be applied up to the taxable wage base of $147,000, which is less than her gross income. Therefore, Sue will pay $9,114 (6.2% x $147,000) as her contribution to the country’s Social Security account for retirees and the disabled.




What Is the FICA Tax?
Short for Federal Insurance Contributions Act taxes, the FICA tax is a duty imposed on wages and earnings. Constituting 7.65% of the employee's gross pay, it actually consists of two separate taxes: Social Security (6.2%) and Medicare (1.45%). The employee and the employer each contribute half of the FICA tax, which is taken out of every paycheck.




How Is Social Security and Medicare Taxed for Self-Employed Individuals?
Self-employed individuals (independent contractors, sole proprietors, etc.) must pay both halves of Social Security and Medicare taxes—the entire 15.3% FICA tax. It is paid on the net income of their business, or the sum of their self-employed earnings after expenses and losses are deducted. While the Social Security and Medicare tax rate is the same as for employees, the self-employed can take a deduction for half the amount on their tax returns.




Does Social Security Count as Income?
Yes, for most people, Social Security does count as income, and is, therefore, subject to income taxes. More specifically, it counts as unearned income. Whether you actually pay taxes on it, however, depends on your overall gross income. In 2023, up to 50% of Social Security income is taxable for individuals with a total gross income of at least $25,000, or couples filing jointly with a combined gross income of at least $32,000. Up to 85% of Social Security benefits are taxable for an individual with a combined gross income of at least $34,000, or a couple filing jointly with a combined gross income of at least $44,000. (These sums include your benefit payments.)




At What Age Is Social Security No Longer Taxed?
Your Social Security benefits could theoretically be tax-free once you reach full retirement age, which is around 66 or 67, depending on your year of birth. But that's only if they're your sole source of income. More specifically, if your overall gross income is $25,000 or above ($32,000 if married filing jointly), they are taxable, at your ordinary income tax rate.
What Is Taxation?  

Taxation is a term for when a taxing authority, usually a government, levies or imposes a financial obligation on its citizens or residents. Paying taxes to governments or officials has been a mainstay of civilization since ancient times.



The term "taxation" applies to all types of involuntary levies, from income to capital gains to estate taxes. Though taxation can be a noun or verb, it is usually referred to as an act; the resulting revenue is usually called "taxes."





Key Takeaways

Taxation occurs when a government or other authority requires that a fee be paid by citizens and corporations, to that authority.The fee is involuntary, and as opposed to other payments, not linked to any specific services that have been or will be provided.Tax occurs on physical assets, including property and transactions, such as a sale of stock, or a home. Types of taxes include income, corporate, capital gains, property, inheritance, and sales.

   Understanding Taxation  

Taxation is differentiated from other forms of payment, such as market exchanges, in that taxation does not require consent and is not directly tied to any services rendered. The government compels taxation through an implicit or explicit threat of force. Taxation is legally different than extortion or a protection racket because the imposing institution is a government, not private actors.



Tax systems have varied considerably across jurisdictions and time. In most modern systems, taxation occurs on both physical assets, such as property and specific events, such as a sales transaction. The formulation of tax policies is one of the most critical and contentious issues in modern politics.


   Taxation in the United States  

The U.S. government was originally funded on very little direct taxation. Instead, federal agencies assessed user fees for ports and other government property. In times of need, the government would decide to sell government assets and bonds or issue an assessment to the states for services rendered. In fact, Thomas Jefferson abolished direct taxation in 1802 after winning the presidency; only excise taxes remained, which Congress repealed in 1817. Between 1817 and 1861, the federal government collected no internal revenue.



An income tax of 3% was levied on high-income earners during the Civil War. It was not until the Sixteenth Amendment was ratified in 1913 that the federal government assessed taxes on income as a regular revenue item. As of 2022, U.S. taxation applies to a wide range of items or activities, from income to cigarette and gasoline purchases to inheritances and when winning at a casino or even Nobel Prize.


   Purposes and Justifications for Taxation  

The most basic function of taxation is to fund government expenditures. Varying justifications and explanations for taxes have been offered throughout history. Early taxes were used to support the ruling classes, raise armies, and build defenses. Often, the authority to tax stemmed from divine or supranational rights.



Later justifications have been offered across utilitarian, economic, or moral considerations. Proponents of progressive levels of taxation on high-income earners argue that taxes encourage a more equitable society. Higher taxes on specific products and services, such as tobacco or gasoline, have been justified as a deterrent to consumption. Advocates of public goods theory argue taxes may be necessary in cases in which the private provision of public goods is considered sub-optimal, such as with lighthouses or national defense.


   Different Types of Taxation  

As mentioned above, taxation applies to all different types of levies. These can include (but are not limited to): 



Income tax: Governments impose income taxes on financial income generated by all entities within their jurisdiction, including individuals and businesses.Corporate tax: This type of tax is imposed on the profit of a business.Capital gains: A tax on capital gains is imposed on any capital gains or profits made by people or businesses from the sale of certain assets including stocks, bonds, or real estate. Property tax: A property tax is asses by a local government and paid for by the owner of a property. This tax is calculated based on property and land values. Inheritance: A type of tax levied on individuals who inherit the estate of a deceased person. Sales tax: A consumption tax imposed by a government on the sale of goods and services. This can take the form of a value-added tax (VAT), a goods and services tax (GST), a state or provincial sales tax, or an excise tax. 




Why Do We Need to Pay Taxes?
There is an old saying that goes "the only sure things in life are death and taxes." Taxation has been a feature of society going back to ancient times. The role of taxes is to help governments fund various undertakings such as public works, infrastructure, and wars. Today, taxpayer dollars are still used for a variety of similar purposes.




Which Country Has the Highest Income Taxes?
As of 2022, the top 10 countries with the highest marginal income taxes are:Ivory Coast - 60%Finland - 56.95%Japan - 55.97%Denmark - 55.90%Austria - 55.00%Sweden - 52.90%Aruba - 52.00%Belgium - 50.00% (tie)Israel - 50.00% (tie)Slovenia - 50.00% (tie)




Which Countries Have Zero Income Tax?
Only a handful of countries have 0% income tax. These include Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, Oman, Kuwait, Qatar, Bahrain, the Bahamas, Bermuda, and the Cayman Islands. Many of these are Arab oil-producing nations that subsidize their budgets with exports rather than taxes. These nations also feature relatively high sales taxes and/or corporate tax rates.
What Is Taxation Without Representation?  

The phrase taxation without representation describes a populace that is required to pay taxes to a government authority without having any say in that government's policies. The term has its origin in a slogan of the American colonials against their British rulers: "Taxation without representation is tyranny."





Key Takeaways

Taxation without representation was possibly the first slogan adopted by American colonists chafing under British rule.They objected to the imposition of taxes on colonists by a government that gave them no role in its policies.In the 21st century, the people of the District of Columbia are citizens who endure taxation without representation.

   History of Opposition to Taxation Without Representation  

Although taxation without representation has been perpetrated in many cultures, the phrase came to the common lexicon during the 1700s in the American colonies. Opposition to taxation without representation was one of the primary causes of the American Revolution.


  The Stamp Act Triggers Colonists  

The British Parliament began taxing its American colonists directly in the 1760s, ostensibly to recoup losses incurred during the Seven Years’ War of 1756 to 1763. One particularly despised tax, imposed by the Stamp Act of 1765, required colonial printers to pay a tax on documents used or created in the colonies and to prove it by affixing an embossed revenue stamp to the documents.



Violators were tried in vice-admiralty courts without a jury. The denial of a trial by peers was a second injury in the minds of colonists.


  Revolt Against the Stamp Act  

Colonists considered the tax to be illegal because they had no representation in the Parliament that passed it and were denied the right to a trial by a jury of their peers. Delegates from nine of the 13 colonies met in New York in October 1765 to form the Stamp Act Congress, better known as the Continental Congress of 1765.



William Samuel Johnson of Connecticut, John Dickinson of Pennsylvania, John Rutledge of South Carolina, and other prominent colonials met for 18 days. They then approved a "Declaration of the Rights and Grievances of the Colonists," stating the delegates’ joint position for other colonists to read. Resolutions three, four, and five stressed the delegates’ loyalty to the crown while stating their objection to taxation without representation.


  Trial Without a Jury  

A later resolution disputed the use of admiralty courts that conducted trials without juries, citing a violation of the rights of all free Englishmen.



The Congress eventually drafted three petitions addressed to King George III, the House of Lords, and the House of Commons.


  After the Stamp Act  

The petitions were initially ignored, but boycotts of British imports and other financial pressures by the colonists finally led to the repeal of the Stamp Act in March 1766.



It was too late. After years of increasing tensions, the American Revolution began on April 19, 1775, with battles between American colonists and British soldiers in Lexington and Concord. 



On June 7, 1776, Richard Henry Lee introduced a resolution to Congress declaring the 13 colonies free from British rule. Benjamin Franklin, John Adams, and Thomas Jefferson were among the representatives chosen to word the resolution.


  A Statement of Intent  

The first part was a simple statement of intent, including the declaration that all men were created equal and have unalienable rights to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. A second section listed the colonists’ grievances and declared their determination to achieve independence. The final paragraph dissolved the colonists’ ties with Britain.



Following debate, the Second Continental Congress adopted the Declaration of Independence on July 4, 1776, with the signing occurring primarily on Aug. 2, 1776. 


   Taxation Without Representation in Modern Times  

Taxation without representation was by no means extinguished with the separation of the American colonies from Britain, not even in the U.S.



Residents of Puerto Rico, for example, are U.S. citizens but do not have the right to vote in presidential elections and have no voting representatives in the U.S. Congress (unless they move to one of the 50 states.)



In addition, the phrase taxation without representation appeared on license plates issued by the District of Columbia beginning in the year 2000. The addition of the slogan was meant to increase awareness of the fact that residents of the District pay federal taxes despite having no voting representation in Congress.



In 2017, the District's City Council added one word to the phrase. It now reads "End Taxation Without Representation."




Which Tax Triggered the Rebellion Against Great Britain?
The Stamp Act of 1765 angered many colonists as it taxed every paper document used in the colonies. It was the first tax that the crown had demanded specifically from American colonists.




Did Taxation Without Representation End After the American Revolution?
Yes and no. While the states in the newly formed country had representation, federal districts like Washington, D.C., and territories like Puerto Rico still lack the same representation on the federal level in the modern era.




Does Taxation Without Representation Refer to Local or Federal Government?
Today, the phrase refers to a lack of representation at the federal level. As an example, Puerto Rico has the same structure as a state, with mayors of cities and a governor, but instead of senators or representatives in Congress, they have a resident commissioner that represents the people in Washington, D.C. Puerto Ricans can only vote for president if they establish residency in the 50 states.

   What Are Taxes?  

Taxes are mandatory contributions levied on individuals or corporations by a government entity—whether local, regional, or national. Tax revenues finance government activities, including public works and services such as roads and schools, or programs such as Social Security and Medicare.



In economics, taxes fall on whoever pays the burden of the tax, whether this is the entity being taxed, such as a business, or the end consumers of the business’s goods. From an accounting perspective, there are various taxes to consider, including payroll taxes, federal and state income taxes, and sales taxes.





Key Takeaways

Taxes are mandatory contributions collected by governments.The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) collects federal income taxes in the United States.There are many forms of taxes and most are applied as a percentage of a monetary exchange (for example, when income is earned or a sales transaction is completed).Other forms of taxes, such as property taxes, are applied based on the assessed value of a held asset.Understanding what triggers a tax situation can enable taxpayers to manage their finances to minimize the impact of taxes.


   Understanding Taxes  

To help fund public works and services—and to build and maintain the infrastructure used in a country—a government usually taxes its individual and corporate residents. The tax collected is used for the betterment of the economy and all who are living in it.



In the United States and many other countries in the world, income taxes are applied to some form of money received by a taxpayer. The money could be income earned from salary, capital gains from investment appreciation, dividends or interest received as additional income, payments made for goods and services, and so on.



Tax revenues are used for public services and the operation of the government, as well as for Social Security and Medicare. As the large baby boomer generation has aged, Social Security and Medicare have claimed increasingly high proportions of the total federal expenditure of tax revenue. Throughout U.S. history, tax policy has been a consistent source of political debate.



A tax requires a percentage of the taxpayer’s earnings or money to be taken and remitted to the government. Payment of taxes at rates levied by the government is compulsory, and tax evasion—the deliberate failure to pay one’s full tax liabilities—is punishable by law. (On the other hand, tax avoidance—actions taken to lessen your tax liability and maximize after-tax income—is perfectly legal.)



Most governments use an agency or department to collect taxes. In the United States, this function is performed federally by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).


   Types of Taxes  

There are several very common types of taxes:



Income tax—A percentage of generated income that is relinquished to the state or federal government
Payroll tax—A percentage withheld from an employee’s pay by an employer, who pays it to the government on the employee’s behalf to fund Medicare and Social Security programs
Corporate tax—A percentage of corporate profits taken as tax by the government to fund federal programs
Sales tax—Taxes levied on certain goods and services; varies by jurisdiction
Property tax—Based on the value of land and property assets
Tariff—Taxes on imported goods; imposed with the aim of strengthening domestic businesses
Estate tax—Rate applied to the fair market value (FMV) of property in a person’s estate at the time of death; the total estate must exceed thresholds set by state and federal governments



Tax systems vary widely among nations, and it is important for individuals and corporations to carefully study a new locale’s tax laws before earning income or doing business there. 



Below, we will take a look at various tax situations in the United States. Generally speaking, the federal government levies income, corporate, and payroll taxes; the state levies income and sales taxes; and municipalities or other local governments mainly levy property taxes.


  Income Tax  

Like many nations, the United States has a progressive income tax system, through which a higher percentage of tax revenues are collected from high-income individuals or corporations than from low-income individual earners. Taxes are applied through marginal tax rates.



A variety of factors affect the marginal tax rate that a taxpayer will pay, including their filing status—married filing jointly, married filing separately, single, or head of household. Which status a person files can make a significant difference in how much they are taxed. The source of a taxpayer’s income also makes a difference in taxation. It’s important to learn the terminology of the different income types that may affect how income is taxed.



Capital gains taxes are of particular relevance for investors. Levied and enforced at the federal level, these are taxes on the profit generated when you sell an asset that's increased in value.



The rate of taxation on the profit depends on the length of time for which the asset was held. Short-term capital gains (on assets sold one year or less after they were acquired) are taxed at the owner’s ordinary income tax rate, whereas long-term gains on assets held for more than a year are taxed at a lower capital gains rate—based on the rationale that lower taxes will encourage high levels of capital investment. Tax records should be maintained to substantiate the length of ownership when both the assets were sold and the tax return was filed.


  Payroll Taxes  

Payroll taxes are withheld from an employee’s paycheck by an employer, who remits the amount to the federal government to fund Medicare and Social Security programs. In 2023, employees will pay 1.45% into Medicare on all wages and 6.2% into Social Security on the first $160,200 earned, up from $147,000 in 2022.






Anyone who earns more than $200,000 as a single filer (or $250,000 for married couples filing jointly) pays an additional 0.9% into Medicare.



Payroll taxes have both an employee portion and an employer portion. The employer remits both the employee portion, described above, and a duplicate amount for the employer portion. The employer rates are the same 6.2% for Social Security up to the wage base limit, and 1.45% for Medicare on all wages. Therefore, the total remitted is 15.3% (6.2% employee Social Security + 6.2% employer Social Security + 1.45% employee Medicare + 1.45% employer Medicare).



Payroll taxes and income taxes differ, although both are withheld from an employee’s paycheck and remitted to the government. Payroll taxes are specifically to fund Social Security and Medicare programs. A self-employed individual must pay the equivalent of both the employee and employer portion of payroll taxes through self-employment taxes, which also fund Social Security and Medicare.


  Corporate Taxes  

Corporate taxes are paid on a company’s taxable income. The steps to calculate a company’s taxable income are:



Sales revenue - cost of goods sold (COGS)= gross profit
Gross profit - operating expenses such as general and administrative expenses (G&A), selling and marketing, research and development (R&D), depreciation, etc. = earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT)
EBIT - interest expense = taxable income



The corporate tax rate in the United States is currently a flat rate of 21%. Before the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) of 2017, the corporate tax rate was 35%.



In August of 2022, the United States Congress passed a new 15% corporate minimum tax into law as part of the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. This new minimum tax only affects U.S. corporations with three-year average book values of $1 billion or more and foreign corporations with three-year average U.S. income over $100 million. 


  Sales Taxes  

Sales taxes are charged at the point of sale when a customer executes the payment for a good or service. The business collects the sales tax from the customer and remits the funds to the government.



Each state can implement its own sales taxes, meaning they vary depending on location. There's even room for cities and counties to use their own rates, provided that they abide by the taxing rules of their state.



In 2022, the highest average state and local sales tax rate was found in Tennessee, at 9.55%. Five states—Alaska, Delaware, Montana, New Hampshire, and Oregon—did not have a state sales tax, although Alaska did allow municipalities to charge local sales tax.


  Property Taxes  

A common property tax in the United States is the real estate ad valorem tax. A millage rate is used to calculate real estate taxes; it represents the amount per every $1,000 of a property’s assessed value. The property’s assessed value is determined by a property assessor appointed by the local government. Reassessments are typically performed every one to five years.



Property tax rates vary considerably by jurisdiction and many states also tax tangible personal property, such as cars and boats.



In FY 2018, the state with the highest property tax collections per capita was New Jersey at $3,378. (The District of Columbia would rank higher if it was counted with the 50 states, at $3,740 per capita.) The lowest state ranking was $598 per capita in Alabama.


  Tariffs  

A tariff is a tax imposed by one country on the goods and services imported from another country. The purpose is to encourage domestic purchases by increasing the price of goods and services imported from other countries.



There are two main types of tariffs: fixed fee tariffs, which are levied as a fixed cost based on the type of item, and ad valorem tariffs, which are assessed as a percentage of the item’s value (like the real estate tax in the previous section).



Tariffs are politically divisive, with debate over whether the policies work as intended.


  Estate Taxes  

Estate taxes are levied only on estates that exceed the exclusion limit set by law. In 2023, the federal exclusion limit is $12.92 million, up from $12.06 million in 2022. Surviving spouses are exempt from estate taxes.



The estate tax due is the taxable estate minus the exclusion limit. For example, a $14.7 million estate would owe estate taxes on $1.78 million.



The estate tax rate is a progressive marginal rate that increases from 18% to 40%. The maximum estate tax rate of 40% is levied on the portion of an estate that exceeds the exclusion limit by more than $1 million.



States may have lower exclusion limits than the federal government, but no state taxes estates worth less than $1 million. Massachusetts and Oregon have the $1 million exemption limits. State rates are also different from the federal rate. In 2022, the highest state estate tax rate, implemented in Hawaii and Washington, was 20%.






Some states levy their own additional estate or inheritance tax, with exclusion limits that differ from those of the federal government.



Estate taxes are different from inheritance taxes in that an estate tax is applied before assets are disbursed to any beneficiaries. An inheritance tax is paid by the beneficiary. There is no federal inheritance tax, and, as of 2022, only six states have an inheritance tax: Iowa, Kentucky, Maryland, Nebraska, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania.


   Tax Delinquency  

Every type of tax has a different due date or reporting requirement. Some are collected immediately at the time of a transaction or leading up to a transaction like sales taxes or tariffs. Others are on a fixed recurring schedule with a due date repeating on a specific date or specific day/month combination (i.e. property taxes being due the first day of April). The due dates for similar types of taxes will vary across governing bodies (i.e. different counties will have different property tax due dates).



Upon failure to remit the appropriate amount of a tax to the taxing authorities, various penalties may be incurred. Regarding the various taxes mentioned above, tax penalties may include:



A penalty assessment resulting in a one-time fee or charge.
An interest assessment resulting in an escalating penalty based on the duration of the delinquency.
A lien placed on underlying assets in the event the delinquent party should be unable to satisfy their debts.
A denial of access or service for transaction-related taxes (i.e. tariffs).
A seizure of company property or placement of a lien on the company property for business-related taxes.




Why Do We Pay Taxes?
Taxes are the primary source of revenue for most governments. Among other things, this money is spent to improve and maintain public infrastructure, including the roads we travel on, and fund public services, such as schools, emergency services, and welfare programs.




How Do Income Taxes Work in the U.S.?
In the U.S., taxation progressively increases as an individual’s income grows. There are currently seven federal tax brackets in the U.S., with rates ranging from 10% to 37%.




Are U.S. Taxes Low?
Generally speaking, U.S. taxes are lower than in other developed nations. In 2018, total U.S. tax revenue represented 24% of gross domestic product (GDP) according to the Tax Policy Center, whereas the average among the other 35 member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) was 34%.




Who Needs to Pay Taxes?
The taxpayer will depend on the type of tax and associated regulation for that tax. For example, federal income tax legislation usually only pertains to people who have earned a certain amount of income or adjusted gross income. Corporate taxes may be limited to companies that have performed business in a specific area or are incorporated to do business within a specific country. Each tax is handled differently, and there are often exceptions and qualifications for who the tax pertains to.




What Are Different Types of Taxes?
Taxes can classified in different ways. Some taxes may be incurred on transactions (i.e. sales taxes or tariffs). Other taxes are incurred on net financial results (i.e. individual income taxes or corporate income taxes). There are also taxes that occur due to one-time or non-recurring events (i.e. estate taxes, capital gains taxes).


   The Bottom Line  

There are many types of taxes that are applied in various ways. Understanding what triggers a tax situation can enable taxpayers to manage their finances to minimize the impact of taxes. Techniques that can help include annual tax-loss harvesting to offset investment gains with investment losses, and estate planning, which works to shelter inherited income for heirs.
What Is a Taxpayer?  

A taxpayer may be an individual or business entity that is obligated to pay taxes to a federal, state, or local government. Taxes from both individuals and businesses are a primary source of revenue for governments. In the United States, individual taxpayers are usually required to file and pay both federal and state tax returns annually. Businesses must also file annual returns but usually plan for and pay regular estimated tax payments throughout the year.





Key Takeaways

A taxpayer may be an individual or business entity that is obligated to pay taxes to a federal, state, or local government.Taxes from both individuals and businesses are a primary source of revenue for governments.Individuals and businesses have different annual income tax obligations.


   Understanding Taxpayers  

The U.S. tax code is legislated and enforced by federal, state, and local governments. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) is the primary governing agency overseeing the implemented income tax code for both individuals and businesses.



State and local revenue agencies are responsible for implementing and enforcing localized taxes such as sales taxes and property taxes. Both individuals and businesses must be aware of their tax obligations since not paying necessary taxes can result in penalties or further legal actions.


   Types of Taxpayers  
  Individuals  

There are specific thresholds governing the obligation to pay annual individual income taxes to the IRS and state revenue departments. The federal threshold is based on an individual’s filing status. Each state will also have its own thresholds.



Individual taxpayers should check both the federal and state thresholds to determine their filing obligations for a given year. The Internal Revenue Service’s Publication 501: Dependents, Standard Deduction, and Filing Information, provides federal tax guidance for individual taxpayers.



An individual’s filing status will influence how much tax is withheld from payroll. It is also a primary factor influencing annual tax obligations for a given year. Therefore, it is important that individual taxpayers maintain the same filing status with their employer that they plan to use for their annual tax filing. Improperly notating the tax filing status on employee withholding forms like the Form W-4 can result in withholding too much or too little which will be reconciled at tax-filing time.



Generally, marriage and dependents (usually children) are the two things that will characterize a taxpayer’s status. If married, an individual can choose to file separately or jointly. Taxpayers also have the option to file as a widower if their spouse has died.



Individuals who are not obligated to file annual tax returns will still encounter taxes in their everyday life. Other than income taxes, taxes are imposed daily and annually through sales taxes on goods and services and property taxes required to be paid separately to local governments. Sales taxes and property taxes vary based on location.


  Filing Thresholds  

Not all individuals in the U.S. are obligated to file a federal tax return and a state tax return. The federal threshold for filing a tax return is detailed by filing the status below. Individual states follow similar status standards but can have differing thresholds.



Some people may not need to file tax returns at all. Some people may benefit from filing a return even if below thresholds because they can be paid a refund with applicable deductions and credits.



Individual taxpayers need a social security number to file tax returns. Social security numbers can be obtained from the Social Security Administration. A social security number will serve as a taxpayer identification number so it is important to obtain one if you plan to have tax obligations.



In general, there is no age level associated with paying federal and state taxes. Any individual who has gross income at or above the threshold levels outlined below should file a tax return.












  Single Taxpayer  

A taxpayer is considered single if s/he is unmarried, divorced, a registered domestic partner, or legally separated according to state law as of the last day of the tax year. The head of a household or a person who is widowed does not fall under the “single” category for tax purposes. Single filers have lower income thresholds for tax filing obligations.


  Head of Household  

A head of household is a single or unmarried taxpayer who pays at least 50% of the costs of supporting his or her household and lives with other qualifying family members for whom they provide support for more than half of the year. This means that the taxpayer must have paid more than half of the total household bills, including rent or mortgage, utility bills, insurance, property taxes, groceries, repairs, and other common household expenses. Some examples of qualifying family members include a dependent child, grandchild, brother, sister, grandparent.


  Married Filing Jointly  

Two taxpayers that wed by the end of the tax year can file their tax returns jointly. When filing under married filing jointly status, couples can record their respective incomes and deductions on the same tax return. A joint tax return will often provide a bigger tax refund or a lower tax liability.



Married filing jointly is best if only one spouse has a significant income. If both spouses work and the income and itemized deductions are large and very unequal, it may be more advantageous to file separately.


  Married Filing Separately  

Married filing separately is a tax status used by married taxpayers who choose to record their respective incomes, deductions, and credits on separate tax returns. Married filing separately may be appealing to couples who find that combining their income pushes them into a higher tax bracket than either of them would be in if they filed separately. There is a potential tax advantage to filing separately when one spouse has significant medical expenses, miscellaneous itemized deductions, or certain available credits.


  Widower  

This category of taxpayer is also referred to as surviving spouse. The federal qualifying widow or widower tax filing status is available for two years for widows and widowers with dependents after their spouse's death.






Individual taxpayers may choose single, head of household, married filing jointly, married filing separately, or widower as their filing status for their annual income tax return filing.


   Individual Tax Rates and Standard Deductions  

Individual taxpayers who must file an annual federal tax return are subject to the following tax rates and standard deductions for 2020 as detailed by their filing status.













All individual taxpayers are entitled to the following Schedule A standard deductions:












   Form 1040  

The current 1040 tax form makes filing easy for individual taxpayers with simple returns. It covers half a page and can be referred to as postcard filing. However, while the front page 1040 is simplified, many taxpayers will have to attach relevant forms or schedules depending on their individual situations.


   Self-Employed Business Taxes for Individuals  

Self-employed or sole-proprietor taxpayers may need to file a Schedule C with their 1040. The Schedule C is primarily an income statement for self-employed workers and sole proprietors. It includes 1099 income. These individuals may qualify for certain business deductions.


   Taxes for Partnerships, Other Small Entities  

Partnerships and limited liability companies (LLCs) are business entities with more than one owner. These entities make up a large portion of the small businesses in the United States. Other types of small entities that may need to consider annual income tax filings can include trusts, estates, and qualified joint ventures.



Partnerships and LLCs are usually taxed as partnerships. For federal taxes, partnerships typically file Form 1065 which is an informational return with K-1 reporting which passes the taxable income or loss to the individual taxpayer owners. Therefore, partners also pay taxes on their K-1 income and file this report using a 1040 Form, which is then subject to individual 1040 tax rates.


   Taxes for Corporations  

Corporations typically make regular estimated tax payments throughout the year. These payments are reconciled with the annual tax filing. Most corporations will file a Form 1120.

Internal Revenue Service. "Instructions for Form 1120." Accessed May 17, 2021.



Form 1120 serves as the primary tax filing document for most corporations and can be compared to Form 1040 for individuals. Like the 1040, Form 1120 also requires attached forms and schedules depending on a corporation’s situation.
What Is a Tax Identification Number (TIN)?  

A Tax Identification Number (TIN) is a nine-digit number used as a tracking number by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). It is required information on all tax returns filed with the IRS. All U.S. tax identification numbers (TIN) or tax I.D. numbers are issued directly by the IRS except Social Security numbers (SSNs), which are issued by the Social Security Administration (SSA).   Foreign tax identifying numbers (foreign TIN) are also not issued by the IRS; rather, they are issued by the country in which the non-U.S. taxpayer pays taxes.

Key Takeaways

Tax identification numbers are nine-digit tracking numbers used by the IRS following tax laws.The IRS issues all U.S. tax I.D. numbers except for social security numbers, which are issued by the Social Security Administration.Tax filers must include their tax identification number on tax-related documents and when claiming benefits.TINs are also required when applying for credit and employment. There are different types of tax identification numbers, such as the employer identification number, individual tax identification number, and adoption tax identification number.


   Understanding the Tax Identification Number (TIN)  

A tax identification number is a unique set of numbers that identifies individuals, corporations, and other entities such as nonprofit organizations (NPOs). Each person or entity must apply for a TIN. Once approved, the assigning agency assigns the applicant a special number.



The TIN, which is also called a taxpayer identification number, is mandatory for anyone filing annual tax returns with the IRS, which the agency uses to track taxpayers. Filers must include the number on tax-related documents and when claiming benefits or services from the government.



TINs are also required for other purposes:



For credit: Banks and other lenders require Social Security numbers on applications for credit. This information is then relayed to the credit bureaus to ensure the right person is filling out the application. The credit reporting agencies also use TINs—notably SSNs—to report and track an individual's credit history.
For employment: Employers require an SSN from anyone applying for employment. This is to ensure that the individual is authorized to work in the United States. Employers verify the numbers with the issuing agency.
For state agencies: Businesses also require state identification numbers for tax purposes in order to file with their state tax agencies. State taxing authorities issue the I.D. number directly to the filer.



Tax identification numbers or taxpayer-identification numbers come in several different forms. Individuals are assigned TINs in the form of Social Security numbers (SSNs), whereas businesses (e.g., corporations and partnerships) are assigned employer identification numbers (EINs). Other types of TINs include the Individual Taxpayer Identification Number (ITIN), the Adoption Taxpayer Identification Number (ATIN), and the Preparer Tax Identification Number (PTIN). More information about these types is noted below.


   Special Considerations  

Almost every country uses TINs for various reasons. For instance, Canada uses Social Insurance Numbers (SINs) for employment, tax, benefits, and credit purposes.   Just like the SSN in the U.S., the SIN is a nine-digit unique identifier that is formatted as XXX-XXX-XXX.



Countries in the European Union also use TINs. They help government agencies identify taxpayers and allow entities to invest their money across the Union.  


   Types of Tax Identification Numbers (TIN)  
  Social Security Number (SSN)  

The social security number (SSN) is the most common tax identification number. SSNs are issued to individuals—U.S. citizens, permanent residents, and certain temporary residents—by the Social Security Administration. These numbers are formatted as XXX-XX-XXXX.



The SSN is required to secure legal employment in the U.S. and to receive social security benefits and other government services. A child must have an SSN before a parent can claim them as a dependent for income tax purposes, which means parents voluntarily apply for the number on behalf of their children. A child with an ITIN can be claimed as a dependent. The SSA processes applications for free, but there are also fee-based services that offer to complete applications for new parents.






Your Social Security number is a unique identifier that can be misused by fraudsters, so make sure you only release it to those you are required to, including the IRS, employers, and lenders.


  Individual Taxpayer Identification Number (ITIN)  

The IRS issues the Individual Taxpayer Identification Number (ITIN) to certain nonresident and resident aliens, their spouses, and their dependents when ineligible for SSNs. Arranged in the same format as an SSN (XXX-XX-XXXX), the ITIN begins with a 9. To get an individual tax id number, the applicant must complete Form W-7 and submit documents supporting his or her resident status. Certain agencies—including colleges, banks, and accounting firms—often help applicants obtain their ITIN.


  Employer Identification Number (EIN)  

The IRS uses the Employee Identification Number (EIN) to identify corporations, trusts, and estates that must pay taxes. Just like SSNs, employer tax ID numbers are also nine digits long, but they are read as XX-XXXXXXX. Those who qualify for an EIN must apply for the number and use it to report their capital gains and income for taxation purposes. Applying for an EIN is free, and businesses can obtain one immediately.  


  Adoption Tax Identification Number (ATIN)  

The ATIN only applies to domestic adoptions when the adoptive parents cannot obtain the child's SSN to complete their tax returns promptly. To qualify, the child must be a U.S. citizen or permanent resident and the adoption must be pending.


  Preparer Tax Identification Number (PTIN)  

As of Jan. 1, 2011, the IRS required the listing of a PTIN on each return filed. Before this date, the use of the PTIN was optional. Any preparer that charges to complete all or part of the tax return for another individual must have and use the PTIN.




How Can I Get a TIN?
You can get a tax identification number by applying directly to the correct agency. For instance, you can get a Social Security number through the Social Security Administration. If you need an Individual Taxpayer Identification number or one for a business, you may be able to obtain one directly from the Internal Revenue Service.




How Do I Know If I Need a TIN?
You need a TIN if you are authorized to work in the United States or if you plan to file taxes with the IRS. You'll also need a TIN if you want to take advantage of benefits or services offered by the government. If you run a business or other organization, you'll also need a TIN to run your day-to-day operations and to report your taxes.




How Can I Find My TIN Online?
The agency that issues your TIN provides you with an official document with your unique identifier. Because it is a sensitive piece of information, you can't go online to retrieve it. If you can't remember or lose your documents, you should contact the issuing agency, such as the SSA, to get your TIN again.




Is a TIN the Same as a Tax I.D.?
A TIN is the same as a tax I.D. as it stands for tax identification number or taxpayer-identification number.




Is a TIN the Same as a Social Security Number?
A Social Security number is an example of a TIN. It allows you to seek employment in the United States, to obtain credit with banks and other lenders, and you can file your annual tax returns with the IRS using your SSN.
What Is the Taylor Rule?  

The Taylor Rule (sometimes referred to as Taylor's rule or Taylor principle) is an equation linking the Federal Reserve's benchmark interest rate to levels of inflation and economic growth. Stanford economist John Taylor originally proposed the rule as a rough guideline for monetary policy but has subsequently urged a fixed-rule policy based on the equation, a cause adopted by Republicans seeking to limit the Federal Reserve's policy discretion.



The Taylor Rule's formula ties the Fed's key interest rate policy instrument, the federal funds rate, to two factors: the difference between the actual and targeted inflation rates and that between the desired and apparent growth in the real Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Because policymakers aim for maximum sustainable growth at the economy's productive potential, the difference between the actual and desired real GDP growth rates can also be described as an output gap.





Key Takeaways

The Taylor Rule is a formula tying a central bank's policy rate to inflation and economic growth.Developed by economist John Taylor in 1993, it assumes an equilibrium federal funds rate 2% above the annual inflation rate.The Taylor Rule adjusts the equilibrium rate based on divergence in inflation and real GDP growth from the central bank's targets.Overshoots of inflation and growth targets raise the policy rate under the Taylor Rule, while shortfalls lower it.The basic Taylor Rule formula doesn't account for the ineffectiveness of negative interest rates or for alternative monetary policy tools like asset purchases.The Taylor Rule formula makes inflation the single most important factor in setting rates, while the Federal Reserve has a dual mandate to promote stable prices and maximum employment.


   Understanding the Taylor Rule  

When Taylor introduced the Taylor Rule formula, he noted it accurately reflected Federal Reserve policy during several years leading up to 1993, but also described it as a "concept...in a policy environment where it is practically impossible to follow mechanically any particular algebraic formula that describes the policy rule."



The rule prescribes a higher federal funds rate when inflation is above the Fed's inflation target, and a lower one if inflation is lagging. Similarly, real GDP growth above a target (typically defined by the economy's full potential) would dictate a higher interest rate, while growth short of the mark would serve to lower it.


   The Taylor Rule Formula  

Taylor's equation in its simplest form looks like:



r = p + 0.5y + 0.5(p - 2) + 2



Where:



r = nominal fed funds ratep = the rate of inflationy = the percent deviation between the current real GDP and the long-term linear trend in GDP 



The equation assumes the equilibrium federal funds rate of 2% above inflation, represented by the sum of p (inflation rate) and the "2" on the far right.



From that equilibrium, the federal funds rate is assumed to move up or down by half the difference between actual and targeted inflation, with overshoots relative to the target increasing the rate and undershoots lowering it.



The other variable is the output gap or the difference between actual and targeted growth in real GDP. As with inflation, each percentage point of the output gap moves the expected federal funds rate by half a percentage point, with growth above target raising it and shortfalls lowering it.


   Taylor Rule Limitations and Criticism  

The Taylor Rule has tended to serve as a fairly accurate guide to monetary policy during relatively calm periods marked by steady growth and moderate inflation, but much less so during economic crises. For instance, the Taylor Rule and its derivatives prescribed a sharply negative federal funds rate during the short, deep recession caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, while in practical terms the fed funds rate is constrained by the zero bound, the Federal Reserve noted in its June 2022 monetary policy report to Congress.



Because monetary policy becomes ineffective at negative interest rates, central banks have responded to severe economic crises with alternative tools including large-scale asset purchases, also known as quantitative easing. The basic Taylor Rule does not consider these policy options, the Fed noted. Nor does it apply risk management principles, treating the output gap and the inflation rate as predictable and their divergences from targets as equally important.



In times of economic stress, these measures are subject to large fluctuations that can complicate policymakers' assessments of their sustainable path. Few faulted the Fed for focusing on downside risks at the depths of the COVID-19 panic, while the Taylor Rule will always treat recent inflation as an equally important consideration regardless of circumstances.



Former Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke used similar arguments in responding to Taylor's criticisms of the Fed's monetary policy before and after the 2007-2009 global financial crisis. Given the limitations of the Taylor Rule formula, "I don’t think we’ll be replacing the FOMC with robots anytime soon," Bernanke concluded.


   Taylor Rule Variations  

By assuming a base short-term interest rate 2% above annual inflation, the Taylor Rule makes inflation its single most important factor. While Federal Reserve vice chair, Janet Yellen referenced a modified Taylor Rule giving equal weight to deviations from the Fed's inflation and growth targets, while noting that it would still have prescribed suboptimally tight monetary policy.



The Federal Reserve's monetary policy report in June 2022 presented a version of such a "balanced-approach" rule, along with an alternative modification of the Taylor Rule delaying the prescribed increases in rates to offset cumulative shortfall in policy accommodation as a result of the effective lower bound limit.



Bernanke has written that the Fed is more likely to trust a Taylor Rule formula doubling the weighting of the output gap factor relative to inflation as most consistent with its dual mandate to promote stable prices and maximum employment.



The Federal Reserve's versions of the Taylor Rule also replace the output gap with the difference between the long-run unemployment rate and current unemployment, in keeping with the employment part of the Fed's mandate. The Federal Reserve focuses on the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) Price Index as its preferred measure of inflation.


   The Bottom Line  

In assuming an equilibrium federal funds rate 2% above annual inflation, the Taylor Rule fails to account for both the Federal Reserve's mandate to promote maximum employment and the range of policy tools at the Fed's disposal. Moreover, a fixed-rule monetary policy discounts the variety and unpredictability of the real world. Taylor himself noted in 1993 that "it is difficult to see how…algebraic policy rules could be sufficiently encompassing" to guide rates. In the same paper, he acknowledged that "there will be episodes where monetary policy will need to be adjusted to deal with special factors."
What Is the Teacher Retirement System (TRS)?  

The Teacher Retirement System (TRS) is a network of state and city-level organizations that collectively administer pensions and retirement accounts for public education employees within their states. They also provide educators with help and advice regarding their retirement planning.



Each state organization offers a different array of plans and benefits to its beneficiaries, which may include not only teachers but other public-education staffers such as maintenance workers, janitors, and administrators.



The biggest such systems—the California State Teachers Retirement System, the Teacher Retirement System of Texas, and the New York State Teachers' Retirement System—are among the 10 largest pension plans in the U.S.





Key Takeaways

The Teacher Retirement System (TRS) is a network of organizations at the state level that primarily administers pensions and other retirement plans for educators.The benefits offered by TRSs include traditional defined-benefit pensions along with defined-contribution plans including 403(b) plans, which resemble 401(k)s.The specific benefits of TRS plans vary widely by state and even by the school district.Studies show that most teachers don't receive their full pensions.


   How a Teacher Retirement System (TRS) Works  

A TRS typically provides a defined-benefit pension plan, which guarantees a monthly benefit based on plan-specific features. Most pensions that use the TRS name are qualified retirement plans under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) code section 401(a).



As with many pensions, TRS plans typically award benefits based on a pension factor that is multiplied by your age or years of service in the plan, which is then multiplied by your final average salary or an average of your highest-earning years of employment.



In addition to a TRS pension plan, many teachers are eligible for a tax-deferred annuity program under code section 403(b) of the Internal Revenue Code. A 403(b) plan operates more like a 401(k) salary reduction plan, which allows participants to defer some of their own salaries into the plan, offering an effective way for teachers to save in addition to their TRS pension plan.



The TRS may also offer disability and death benefits to its members.


   Special Considerations  

The majority of state TRSs receive low rankings and statistics show that only one out of five teachers receive their full pensions. Reports also indicate that only 50% of teachers remain in a TRS long enough to receive minimum benefits.



Studies recommend that teachers do not relocate in their careers, particularly suggesting that teachers do not cross state lines for new jobs as it is one of the sure-fire ways to lose out on their pension.



The poor status of TRSs is seen through their ratings; 20 states received an F grade while none received an A grade The same studies indicate that the situation for teacher retirement plans is not improving but rather getting worse.



The problem is also worsened because new teachers have benefits cut to make up the shortfall for older workers; meaning that new hires have to work more years before receiving benefits. The plans are in dire need of reform.




What Is the Retirement Plan for Teachers?
Teachers, whether for public or private schools, will have access to defined-benefit pension plans. Through the state's Teacher Retirement System, teachers can access the retirement plans offered to them. Teachers can and should also contribute to defined contribution plans, such as 403(b) plans and 457(b) plans. Most teachers are not likely to qualify for Social Security as they do not pay into the system.




At What Age Do Most Teachers Retire?
Most teachers retire at the age of 58. The age at which teachers can start receiving retirement benefits will depend on the state. Many states require teachers work for a certain number of years before being eligible, regardless of their age.




What State Has the Best Teacher Retirement Plan?
The state that has the best teacher retirement plan is South Dakota. This state is the one that comes most close to earning 100% of possible points by earning 88.4% of all possible points. Other states that also ranked high include Tennessee (82.5%) and Washington (81.9%). The worst scores were earned by Kentucky (39.7%), New Jersey (36.2%), and Illinois (34.9).
What Is the Teachers Insurance Annuity Association (TIAA)?  

The Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association (TIAA) is a financial organization that provides investment and insurance services for those working for organizations in the nonprofit industry in academic, research, medical, government, and cultural fields.



TIAA has a history that dates back to the late Andrew Carnegie, whose Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching created the initial organization in order to service the pension needs of professors.



The financial services company was founded in 1918 with a $1 million endowment from the Carnegie Foundation. It went by the name TIAA-CREF, short for Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association-College Retirement Equities Fund, until 2016 when it rebranded under the shortened name of TIAA.





Key Takeaways

TIAA is an acronym for the Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association.TIAA is led by Thasunda Brown Duckett, its president and CEO.It is a for-profit financial institution that provides pension, insurance, and investment services, mainly for teachers and their families.TIAA was formerly also part of the College Retirement Equities Fund (CREF), which spun off as a separate entity in 2016.Prior to 1997, TIAA-CREF operated as a nonprofit.


   Understanding the Teachers Insurance Annuity Association (TIAA)  

After Congress revoked its tax-exempt status in the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997, TIAA shifted its model to become a for-profit financial services corporation, offering retirement products, 529 college savings plans, managed investment accounts, savings products, and brokerage accounts. It is now structured as a nonprofit organization that has taxable subsidiaries.



TIAA’s profits are disbursed to policyholders of the TIAA Traditional account based on a yearly determination by the TIAA board. The main office is in New York, and as of 2023, there are 133 offices in the U.S.



As of 2023, TIAA has more than five million active and retired employee accounts at more than 15,000 institutions, with $1.3 trillion under management. Its investment manager, Nuveen, is the No.1-ranked asset manager of real assets in farmland as of 2023. It was ranked the No.1 Best Overall Large Fund company by the Refinitiv Lipper Fund Awards for six years in a row, from 2013 to 2018. It also won the Lipper Best Mixed Assets Large Fund Group award for five consecutive years, from 2016 to 2020.


   Adding the College Retirement Equities Fund (CREF)  

While the creation of TIAA in 1918 as a means of providing guaranteed lifetime income and insurance was a groundbreaking new resource for teachers and educators, it was the establishment of the College Retirement Equities Fund (CREF) in 1952 that started the company on the road to becoming a diversified financial services firm.



Citing rapidly increasingly life expectancies, CREF allowed individuals the opportunity to add equity investments to their personal portfolios through a variable annuity product. It was designed to use the higher expected returns of stocks to help stretch out the retirement income streams of workers.



Fortune magazine described CREF in 1952 as “the biggest development in the insurance investment business since the passage of the Social Security Act in 1935.” TIAA dropped CREF from its name in 2016.


   TIAA Acquisitions  

In the past decade, TIAA has made some acquisitions to grow its portfolio and product offerings.



In April 2014, TIAA announced it would acquire Nuveen Investments in a deal valued at $6.25 billion.In April 2015, TIAA announced that it had acquired full ownership of TIAA Henderson Real Estate, buying out its joint venture partner, Henderson Global Investors, for £80 million.In August 2016, TIAA agreed to purchase EverBank Financial Corp. for $2.5 billion in cash. The deal was completed in June 2017.



TIAA has demonstrated a history of accepting investment strategies before the strategies became mainstream. In 1979, the company was one of the first to utilize a broad portfolio of international stocks as part of its investment strategy. In 1990, it added the CREF Social Choice Account to its lineup, giving customers a socially responsible investing option. In 1992, it introduced the Rollover IRA. In 1995, TIAA offered individuals the ability to invest in directly owned real estate properties. In 1998, the company entered the 529 marketplace.



On May 1, 2021, Thasunda Brown Duckett became TIAA’s president and chief executive officer (CEO), making her one of only two Black women heading Fortune 500 companies. Previously, she was the CEO of Chase Consumer Banking.



Duckett was named one of Fortune’s Most Powerful Women in 2021. American Banker magazine named her the 7th Most Powerful Woman in Banking in 2019. Black Enterprise magazine included her on its Most Powerful Women in Corporate America list in 2015.


   TIAA Retirement Products  

TIAA offers a variety of retirement products. Among the most popular are:


  TIAA-CREF Traditional Plan  

This employer-sponsored plan is a defined-contribution plan like a 401(k), and there are significant differences between the two when it comes to their structure, funding, investments, and payouts. The TIAA-CREF Traditional plan can be funded with either fixed or variable annuities, and its emphasis is on providing lifetime income at retirement rather than tax-exempt wealth accumulation. There are eight different variable CREF structures:



Stock AccountGrowth AccountGlobal Equities AccountEquity Index AccountSocial Choice AccountBond Market AccountInflation-Linked Bond AccountMoney Market Account



TIAA plans aren’t as concerned with the amount of money saved, which is intended to supplement other retirement income; instead, they look to future annual income generated by the accumulated money. The funds are annuitized to provide guaranteed lifetime annual income. In that sense, the TIAA traditional plan functions more like a defined-benefit pension plan than a 401(k).


  TIAA Personal Annuities  

You can also purchase a personal annuity directly from TIAA, which offers both the fixed and variable kinds. A fixed annuity grows at a slow but steady rate as you save, even during financial downturns. There are no mandatory withdrawals prior to age 90, and the money in your annuity grows tax-deferred. A variety of time periods are available.



A variable annuity offers a chance for greater growth through investments but is subject to the vagaries of the market. There are virtually no contribution limits, allowing you to continue investing retirement money after you have maxed out your 401(k), 403(b), or individual retirement account (IRA).



TIAA offers more than 60+ investment choices, and your money grows tax-deferred. You can invest or withdraw funds at any time, and both you and your spouse can receive payments in retirement. At retirement, you can choose to generate a set amount of annual lifetime income or take the money in a lump-sum payment. You never pay a surrender charge.


  TIAA IRAs  

TIAA offers traditional and Roth IRAs, and it also allows you to roll over other retirement accounts—401(k), 403(b), or IRA plans—into a new or existing TIAA IRA. Rollovers can also go the other way: from a TIAA plan to a regular retirement account. Traditional IRAs provide a tax break on the money you deposit, but you must pay taxes on the money when you withdraw it. Roth IRAs involve after-tax contributions, meaning that you don’t pay taxes on withdrawals. TIAA also has SEP and SIMPLE IRAs for small businesses.


  TIAA Target-Date Funds  

Target-date funds are labeled “lifecycle” funds by TIAA and allow you to invest in mutual funds. You pick a retirement date, and the fund automatically adjusts its mix of high-risk and low-risk investments over time, with the latter increasing as you come closer to your retirement date.




Who Is Eligible for a TIAA-CREF Retirement Plan?
These plans are available to workers in the nonprofit sector in academic, research, medical, government, and cultural fields. TIAA was originally started in 1918 to provide pensions for professors.




Is a TIAA-CREF Plan the Same as a 401(k)?
No, though there are some similarities. Both are defined-contribution plans, but a 401(k) is designed to provide supplemental income in retirement and attempts to maximize the funds in it, while a TIAA plan is intended to provide a guaranteed lifetime annual income by annuitizing the money in the plan, making the amount saved less paramount.




Is the TIAA a Nonprofit Organization?
No, however, they are owned by a not-for-profit company and have a charter to operate without profit. Such an organization came into being after Congress stripped the TIAA of its tax-exempt status in the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997.


   The Bottom Line  

The Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association (TIAA) is a for-profit financial organization that provides pension, insurance, and investment services, mainly for teachers and their families. The mission of the organization, founded more than 100 years ago, is "helping those who help others find confidence in retirement."



TIAA serves over five million active and retired employees participating at more than 15,000 institutions. Today, TIAA's reach extends well beyond education, being the leading provider of financial services also in the research, medical, cultural, and governmental fields.
What Is Technical Analysis?  

Technical analysis is a trading discipline employed to evaluate investments and identify trading opportunities by analyzing statistical trends gathered from trading activity, such as price movement and volume. Unlike fundamental analysis, which attempts to evaluate a security's value based on business results such as sales and earnings, technical analysis focuses on the study of price and volume.





Key Takeaways


Technical analysis is a trading discipline employed to evaluate investments and identify trading opportunities in price trends and patterns seen on charts.
Technical analysts believe past trading activity and price changes of a security can be valuable indicators of the security's future price movements.
Technical analysis may be contrasted with fundamental analysis, which focuses on a company's financials rather than historical price patterns or stock trends.

   Understanding Technical Analysis  

Technical analysis tools are used to scrutinize the ways supply and demand for a security will affect changes in price, volume, and implied volatility. It operates from the assumption that past trading activity and price changes of a security can be valuable indicators of the security's future price movements when paired with appropriate investing or trading rules.



It is often used to generate short-term trading signals from various charting tools, but can also help improve the evaluation of a security's strength or weakness relative to the broader market or one of its sectors. This information helps analysts improve their overall valuation estimate.



Technical analysis as we know it today was first introduced by Charles Dow and the Dow Theory in the late 1800s. Several noteworthy researchers including William P. Hamilton, Robert Rhea, Edson Gould, and John Magee further contributed to Dow Theory concepts helping to form its basis. Nowadays technical analysis has evolved to include hundreds of patterns and signals developed through years of research.






   Using Technical Analysis  

Professional analysts often use technical analysis in conjunction with other forms of research. Retail traders may make decisions based solely on the price charts of a security and similar statistics, but practicing equity analysts rarely limit their research to fundamental or technical analysis alone.



Technical analysis can be applied to any security with historical trading data. This includes stocks, futures, commodities, fixed-income, currencies, and other securities. In fact, technical analysis is far more prevalent in commodities and forex markets where traders focus on short-term price movements.



Technical analysis attempts to forecast the price movement of virtually any tradable instrument that is generally subject to forces of supply and demand, including stocks, bonds, futures, and currency pairs. In fact, some view technical analysis as simply the study of supply and demand forces as reflected in the market price movements of a security.



Technical analysis most commonly applies to price changes, but some analysts track numbers other than just price, such as trading volume or open interest figures.


  Technical Analysis Indicators  

Across the industry, there are hundreds of patterns and signals that have been developed by researchers to support technical analysis trading. Technical analysts have also developed numerous types of trading systems to help them forecast and trade on price movements.



Some indicators are focused primarily on identifying the current market trend, including support and resistance areas, while others are focused on determining the strength of a trend and the likelihood of its continuation. Commonly used technical indicators and charting patterns include trendlines, channels, moving averages, and momentum indicators.



In general, technical analysts look at the following broad types of indicators:



Price trends
Chart patterns
Volume and momentum indicators
Oscillators
Moving averages
Support and resistance levels


   Underlying Assumptions of Technical Analysis  

There are two primary methods used to analyze securities and make investment decisions: fundamental analysis and technical analysis. Fundamental analysis involves analyzing a company’s financial statements to determine the fair value of the business, while technical analysis assumes that a security's price already reflects all publicly available information and instead focuses on the statistical analysis of price movements.



Technical analysis attempts to understand the market sentiment behind price trends by looking for patterns and trends rather than analyzing a security's fundamental attributes.



Charles Dow released a series of editorials discussing technical analysis theory. His writings included two basic assumptions that have continued to form the framework for technical analysis trading.



Markets are efficient with values representing factors that influence a security's price, butEven random market price movements appear to move in identifiable patterns and trends that tend to repeat over time.



Today the field of technical analysis builds on Dow's work. Professional analysts typically accept three general assumptions for the discipline:



The market discounts everything: Technical analysts believe that everything from a company's fundamentals to broad market factors to market psychology is already priced into the stock. This point of view is congruent with the Efficient Markets Hypothesis (EMH) which assumes a similar conclusion about prices. The only thing remaining is the analysis of price movements, which technical analysts view as the product of supply and demand for a particular stock in the market.
Price moves in trends: Technical analysts expect that prices, even in random market movements, will exhibit trends regardless of the time frame being observed. In other words, a stock price is more likely to continue a past trend than move erratically. Most technical trading strategies are based on this assumption.
History tends to repeat itself: Technical analysts believe that history tends to repeat itself. The repetitive nature of price movements is often attributed to market psychology, which tends to be very predictable based on emotions like fear or excitement. Technical analysis uses chart patterns to analyze these emotions and subsequent market movements to understand trends. While many forms of technical analysis have been used for more than 100 years, they are still believed to be relevant because they illustrate patterns in price movements that often repeat themselves.


   Technical Analysis vs. Fundamental Analysis  

Fundamental analysis and technical analysis, the major schools of thought when it comes to approaching the markets, are at opposite ends of the spectrum. Both methods are used for researching and forecasting future trends in stock prices, and like any investment strategy or philosophy, both have their advocates and adversaries.



Fundamental analysis is a method of evaluating securities by attempting to measure the intrinsic value of a stock. Fundamental analysts study everything from the overall economy and industry conditions to the financial condition and management of companies. Earnings, expenses, assets, and liabilities are all important characteristics to fundamental analysts.



Technical analysis differs from fundamental analysis in that the stock's price and volume are the only inputs. The core assumption is that all known fundamentals are factored into price; thus, there is no need to pay close attention to them. Technical analysts do not attempt to measure a security's intrinsic value, but instead, use stock charts to identify patterns and trends that suggest what a stock will do in the future.


   Limitations of Technical Analysis  

Some analysts and academic researchers expect that the EMH demonstrates why they shouldn't expect any actionable information to be contained in historical price and volume data; however, by the same reasoning, neither should business fundamentals provide any actionable information. These points of view are known as the weak form and semi-strong form of the EMH.



Another criticism of technical analysis is that history does not repeat itself exactly, so price pattern study is of dubious importance and can be ignored. Prices seem to be better modeled by assuming a random walk.



A third criticism of technical analysis is that it works in some cases but only because it constitutes a self-fulfilling prophecy. For example, many technical traders will place a stop-loss order below the 200-day moving average of a certain company. If a large number of traders have done so and the stock reaches this price, there will be a large number of sell orders, which will push the stock down, confirming the movement traders anticipated.



Then, other traders will see the price decrease and also sell their positions, reinforcing the strength of the trend. This short-term selling pressure can be considered self-fulfilling, but it will have little bearing on where the asset's price will be weeks or months from now.



In sum, if enough people use the same signals, they could cause the movement foretold by the signal, but over the long run, this sole group of traders cannot drive the price.


   Chartered Market Technician (CMT)  

Among professional analysts, the CMT Association supports the largest collection of chartered or certified analysts using technical analysis professionally around the world. The association's Chartered Market Technician (CMT) designation can be obtained after three levels of exams that cover both a broad and deep look at technical analysis tools.



The association now waives Level 1 of the CMT exam for those who are Certified Financial Analyst (CFA) charterholders. This demonstrates how well the two disciplines reinforce each other.




What Assumptions Do Technical Analysts Make?
Professional technical analysts typically accept three general assumptions for the discipline. The first is that, similar to the efficient market hypothesis, the market discounts everything. Second, they expect that prices, even in random market movements, will exhibit trends regardless of the time frame being observed. Finally, they believe that history tends to repeat itself. The repetitive nature of price movements is often attributed to market psychology, which tends to be very predictable based on emotions like fear or excitement. 




What's the Difference Between Fundamental and Technical Analysis?
Fundamental analysis is a method of evaluating securities by attempting to measure the intrinsic value of a stock. The core assumption of technical analysis, on the other hand, is that all known fundamentals are factored into price; thus, there is no need to pay close attention to them. Technical analysts do not attempt to measure a security's intrinsic value, but instead, use stock charts to identify patterns and trends that might suggest what the security will do in the future.




How Can I Learn Technical Analysis?
There are a variety of ways to learn technical analysis. The first step is to learn the basics of investing, stocks, markets, and financials. This can all be done through books, online courses, online material, and classes. Once the basics are understood, from there you can use the same types of materials but those that focus specifically on technical analysis. Investopedia's course on technical analysis is one specific option.
What Is Technical Analysis?  

Technical analysis is the study of historical market data, including price and volume. Using insights from market psychology, behavioral economics, and quantitative analysis, technical analysts aim to use past performance to predict future market behavior. The two most common forms of technical analysis are chart patterns and technical (statistical) indicators.





Key Takeaways

Technical analysis attempts to predict future price movements, providing traders with the information needed to make a profit.Traders apply technical analysis tools to charts in order to identify entry and exit points for potential trades.An underlying assumption of technical analysis is that the market has processed all available information and that it is reflected in the price chart.

   What Does Technical Analysis Tell You?  

Technical analysis is a blanket term for a variety of strategies that depend on interpretation of price action in a stock. Most technical analysis is focused on determining whether or not a current trend will continue and, if not, when it will reverse. Some technical analysts swear by trendlines, others use candlestick formations, and yet others prefer bands and boxes created through a mathematical visualization. Most technical analysts use some combination of tools to recognize potential entry and exit points for trades. A chart formation may indicate an entry point for a short seller, for example, but the trader will look at moving averages for different time periods to confirm that a breakdown is likely.


   A Brief History of Technical Analysis  

The technical analysis of stocks and trends has been used for hundreds of years. In Europe, Joseph de la Vega adopted early technical analysis techniques to predict Dutch markets in the 17th century. In its modern form, however, technical analysis owes heavily to Charles Dow, William P. Hamilton, Robert Rhea, Edson Gould, and many others—including a ballroom dancer named Nicolas Darvas. These people represented a new perspective on the market as a tide that is best measured in highs and lows on a chart rather than by the particulars of the underlying company. The diverse collection of theories from early technical analysts were brought together and formalized in 1948 with the publishing of Technical Analysis of Stock Trends by Robert D. Edwards and John Magee.



Candlestick patterns date back to Japanese merchants eager to detect trading patterns for their rice harvests. Studying these ancient patterns became popular in the 1990s in the U.S. with the advent of internet day trading. Investors analyzed historical stock charts eager to discover new patterns for use when recommending trades. Candlestick reversal patterns in particular are critically important for investors to identify, and there are several other commonly used candlestick charting patterns. The doji and the engulfing pattern are all used to predict an imminent bearish reversal.


   How to Use Technical Analysis  

The core principle underlying technical analysis is that the market price reflects all available information that could impact a market. As a result, there's no need to look at economic, fundamental, or new developments since they're already priced into a given security. Technical analysts generally believe that prices move in trends and history tends to repeat itself when it comes to the market's overall psychology. The two major types of technical analysis are chart patterns and technical (statistical) indicators.



Chart patterns are a subjective form of technical analysis where technicians attempt to identify areas of support and resistance on a chart by looking at specific patterns. These patterns, underpinned by psychological factors, are designed to predict where prices are headed, following a breakout or breakdown from a specific price point and time. For example, an ascending triangle chart pattern is a bullish chart pattern that shows a key area of resistance. A breakout from this resistance could lead to a significant, high-volume move higher.



Technical indicators are a statistical form of technical analysis where technicians apply various mathematical formulas to prices and volumes. The most common technical indicators are moving averages, which smooth price data to help make it easier to spot trends. More complex technical indicators include the moving average convergence divergence (MACD), which looks at the interplay between several moving averages. Many trading systems are based on technical indicators since they can be quantitatively calculated.


   The Difference Between Technical Analysis and Fundamental Analysis  

Fundamental analysis and technical analysis are the two big factions in finance. Whereas technical analysts believe the best approach is to follow the trend as it forms through market action, fundamental analysts believe the market often overlooks value. Fundamental analysts will ignore chart trends in favor of digging through the balance sheet and the market profile of a company in search of intrinsic value not currently reflected in the price. There are many examples of successful investors using fundamental or technical analysis to guide their trading and even those who incorporate elements of both. On the whole, however, technical analysis lends itself to a faster investing pace, whereas fundamental analysis generally has a longer decision timeline and holding period by virtue of the time required for the extra due diligence.


   Limitations of Technical Analysis  

Technical analysis has the same limitation of any strategy based on particular trade triggers. The chart can be misinterpreted. The formation may be predicated on low volume. The periods being used for the moving averages may be too long or too short for the type of trade you are looking to make. Leaving those aside, the technical analysis of stocks and trends has a fascinating limitation unique to itself.



As more technical analysis strategies, tools, and techniques become widely adopted, these have a material impact on the price action. For example, are those three black crows forming because the priced-in information is justifying a bearish reversal or because traders universally agree that they should be followed by a bearish reversal and bring that about by taking up short positions? Although this is an interesting question, a true technical analyst doesn't actually care as long as the trading model continues to work.

What Is a Technical Analyst?  

A technical analyst, also known as a chartist or market technician, is a securities researcher or trader who analyzes investments based on past market prices and technical indicators.



Technicians believe that short-term price movements are the result of supply and demand forces in the market for a given security. Thus, for technicians, the fundamentals of the security are less relevant than the current balance of buyers and sellers. Based on the careful interpretation of past trading patterns, technical analysts try to discern this balance with the aim of predicting future price movements.





Key Takeaways

Technical analysts, also known as chartists or technicians, employ technical analysis in their trading and research.Technical analysis looks for price patterns and trends based on historical performance to identify signals based on market sentiment and psychology.Technical analysts may augment their training and education by earning the chartered market technician (CMT) professional designation.


   Understanding Technical Analysts  

Technical analysis is a trading discipline employed to evaluate investments and identify trading opportunities. It involves analyzing statistical trends gathered from trading activity, such as price movement and volume.



Unlike fundamental analysts, who attempt to evaluate a security's intrinsic value, technical analysts focus on patterns of price movements, trading signals, and various other analytical charting tools to evaluate a security's strength or weakness. Technical analysis utilizes price movements and chart histories to uncover trends and sentiment based on revealed market psychology.



Technical analysts have developed an extensive toolbox of analysis techniques and indicators. Typically, the use of one technical indicator does not provide enough information to make a trading decision; technicians use several indicators to confirm a hypothesis before taking action. There is no broad consensus on the best method of identifying future price movements, so most technicians gradually develop their own set of trading rules based on their knowledge and experience.






Technical analysts can work in either buy-side or sell-side firms and, as of 2022, earn an average income of $108,080.



Technical analysts rely on technical analysis trading systems, which form the basis for their investment trades. Since many technical analysts are day traders, these systems are typically targeted at individual traders.



Chartists have a variety of options to choose from with many programs available through brokerages. Brokerages will often include comprehensive charting software with featured charting patterns in their service offering. Many advanced chartists, however, choose to obtain charting software from independent vendors in order to have access to the full range of available charting patterns.


   Technical Analyst Certification and Licensing  

Licensing is required for most technical analysts, although it will depend on the specific duties they perform, the organization they work for, and the state in which they reside. The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) issues licenses to technicians who are sponsored by the firm that employs them.



Many technical analysts hold certifications from industry-recognized professional associations, such as the CFA Institute. To earn the Chartered Financial Analyst designation from the institute, technical analysts must have relevant work experience and pass several exams. Other prominent associations that technical analysts may belong to include the American Association of Professional Technical Analysts and the International Federation of Technical Analysts.



The Chartered Market Technician (CMT) designation marks the highest level of training within the discipline and is the preeminent designation for practitioners worldwide. It is issued by the CMT Association (formerly the MTA), a global credentialing body with nearly 50 years of service to the financial industry.



Technical analysis provides the tools to successfully navigate the gap between intrinsic value and market price across all asset classes through a disciplined, systematic approach to market behavior and the law of supply and demand. Earning the CMT demonstrates mastery of a core body of knowledge of investment risk in portfolio management, including quantitative approaches to market research and rules-based trading system design and testing.


   Technical Analyst Job Responsibilities  

A technical analyst observes and interprets the price action of a security to make predictions about its future direction. They apply this price data to statistical formulas to determine probable outcomes.



Technicians may present their findings both internally and externally. For example, a technical analyst may present several tactical trading ideas at their investment firm’s morning meeting as well as give a presentation at a client seminar.



Technical analysts may also work closely with fundamental analysts to compile research reports that provide comprehensive analysis for stocks that a brokerage firm covers.
What Is a Technical Indicator?  

Technical indicators are heuristic or pattern-based signals produced by the price, volume, and/or open interest of a security or contract used by traders who follow technical analysis.



By analyzing historical data, technical analysts use indicators to predict future price movements. Examples of common technical indicators include the Relative Strength Index (RSI), Money Flow Index (MFI), stochastics, moving average convergence divergence (MACD), and Bollinger Bands®.





Key Takeaways

Technical indicators are heuristic or mathematical calculations based on the price, volume, or open interest of a security or contract used by traders who follow technical analysis.Technical analysts or chartists look for technical indicators in historical asset price data to judge entry and exit points for trades.There are several technical indicators that fall broadly into two main categories: overlays and oscillators.






   How Technical Indicators Work  

Technical analysis is a trading discipline employed to evaluate investments and identify trading opportunities by analyzing statistical trends gathered from trading activity, such as price movement and volume. Unlike fundamental analysts, who attempt to evaluate a security’s intrinsic value based on financial or economic data, technical analysts focus on patterns of price movements, trading signals, and various other analytical charting tools to evaluate a security’s strength or weakness.



Technical analysis can be used on any security with historical trading data. This includes stocks, futures, commodities, fixed-income, currencies, and other securities. In this tutorial, we’ll usually analyze stocks in our examples, but keep in mind that these concepts can be applied to any type of security. In fact, technical analysis is far more prevalent in commodities and forex markets, where traders focus on short-term price movements.



Technical indicators, also known as “technicals,” are focused on historical trading data, such as price, volume, and open interest, rather than the fundamentals of a business, such as earnings, revenue, or profit margins. Technical indicators are commonly used by active traders, since they’re designed to analyze short-term price movements, but long-term investors may also use technical indicators to identify entry and exit points.


   Types of Indicators  

There are two basic types of technical indicators:



Overlays: Technical indicators that use the same scale as prices are plotted over the top of the prices on a stock chart. Examples include moving averages and Bollinger Bands®.
Oscillators: Technical indicators that oscillate between a local minimum and maximum are plotted above or below a price chart. Examples include the stochastic oscillator, MACD, or RSI.



Traders often use many different technical indicators when analyzing a security. With thousands of different options, traders must choose the indicators that work best for them and familiarize themselves with how they work. Traders may also combine technical indicators with more subjective forms of technical analysis, such as looking at chart patterns, to come up with trade ideas. Technical indicators can also be incorporated into automated trading systems, given their quantitative nature.


   Example of Technical Indicators  

The following chart shows some of the most common technical indicators, including moving averages, the RSI, and the MACD.

In this example, the 50- and 200-day moving averages are plotted over the top of the prices to show where the current price stands relative to its historical averages. The 50-day moving averages is higher than the 200-day moving average in this case, which suggests that the overall trend has been positive. The RSI above the chart shows the strength of the current trend—a neutral 49.07, in this case. The MACD below the chart shows how the two moving averages have converged or diverged—slightly bearish, in this case.
What Are Technical Job Skills?  

Technical job skills, sometimes referred to as hard skills, are specific talents and expertise an individual possesses that help them perform a certain task or job. These skills differ from soft skills, which instead describe character and personality traits.



Technical skills are abilities an individual acquires through practice and learning, although a person may bring an inherent propensity for a certain skill. An individual who possesses a particular proficiency for coding, for instance, would have a sought-after technical skill as a job candidate at a software or technology company.





Key Takeaways

Technical skills are practical abilities that an employee possesses that help a firm achieve its functions.These skills are obtained and honed through education, practice, and repetition, and may be either manual (e.g. sewing) or cognitive (e.g. accounting).Unlike "soft skills," people can prove their technical competencies by taking an aptitude test or providing certification, a degree, an apprenticeship, or work experience.


   Understanding Technical Job Skills  

Technical job skills are ideal to list on the skill section of a resume because they shine a light on abilities and strengths. However, it is important to realize not all technical skills at an individual’s disposal should be listed. The list should be tailored to fit the job. This gives the individual a greater chance of getting hired.



New or prospective employees may be subject to an aptitude test to measure their proficiency at various technical skills and abilities. Aptitude tests assume that individuals have inherent strengths and weaknesses, and have a natural inclination toward success or failure in specific areas based on their innate characteristics. Note that an aptitude test does not test knowledge or intelligence; only a particular skill or propensity. Therefore, it is not a test for which a person can study.



Employees with technical job skills are referred to as skilled labor, and may be contrasted with unskilled labor.


   Technical Skills vs. Soft Skills  

On job applications, cover letters, resumes, and in-person during the interview process, employers seek out applicants with both hard and soft skills. Hard, or technical, skills are those abilities or skill sets that are teachable and can be quantified easily. Examples of hard skills include certificates or degrees in specific disciplines; mastery or fluidity in a foreign language; efficient operation of specific machinery; and the ability to generate computer programs.



Soft skills differ from hard skills in that they are subjective and can be incredibly difficult to quantify. Soft skills are inherent skills relating to an individual’s character or personality. These skills are sometimes referred to as “interpersonal skills” or “people skills.” Examples of soft skills include effective communication; working well with others; time management; the ability to be persuasive; flexibility; and patience.


  What Employers Want  

Technical job skills play a vital role in getting hired. Certain hard skills are necessary for a variety of jobs, and some positions require a specific set or combination of these skills. However, some of the more basic or intermediate types of technical skills are fairly easy for an employer to teach to a new employee. Soft skills, because they are essentially inherent, are extremely difficult to teach. In some cases, soft skills cannot be taught.



For this reason, employers constantly look for potential employees with a mix of technical and soft skills that will allow them to complete tasks in a fast and efficient way. Because customer service/satisfaction is one of the most important aspects for any company or organization, soft skills are often considered of greater value.


   In-Demand Technical Job Skills  

Programming and coding: Programming and coding skills are not just for developers. These skills are also relevant for IT staff, customer service teams, and project managers that need to support customers or coordinate projects. Any IT graduate will be more valuable to an employer from the outset if they know how to code.
Project Management: The ability to effectively marshal resources, people, and budgets is one of the best technical skills that you can have. Project managers work in virtually every industry, from construction to digital design. A qualified project manager can deliver projects more efficiently, use resources cost-effectively and deploy the right teams to complete work. A skilled project manager will save a company money, prompt the resolution of problems, and help anticipate future issues.
Data Analysis: Data analysis provides businesses with the vital information they need to retain market share and build their competitive advantage. It can be a complex task, but good data analysis can result in more effective sales and marketing operations, increased opportunities to generate revenue, and greater operational efficiency.
Information Security: Data breaches can have a devastating impact on a business, from loss of business to irreparable damage to a brand. As such, demand is increasing for technical security specialists.
Design: Designers need to master a number of technical skills, from software such as Photoshop to the tools they use to create wireframes. Technical skills such as a working knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are also useful.
Content and SEO: Today's writing skills go much further than simply using a word processor to create a great piece of content. Writers also need to have serious digital skills. They need to understand content management systems, search engine optimization (SEO), and even know how to put together a website or blog.


   Example of Technical Job Skills  

Accounting is a profession that requires a fairly rigid set of technical skills. In addition to knowing the ins and outs of accounting practice and tax law, familiarity with industry-specific software, such as Great Plains, QuickBooks, Peachtree, SAP Software, and tax preparation software, is also often required these days.



Accountants need to know how to prepare and interpret financial statements and other accounting reports, develop efficient financial reporting mechanisms, and plan and implement accounting controls.



Note that some of the other skills accountants need might be categorized as soft skills. They must be prepared to communicate effectively with regulators, deal with external auditors, and stay updated on current issues and changes in industry regulations.
What Are Technical Skills?  

Technical skills refer to the specialized knowledge and expertise needed to accomplish complex actions, tasks, and processes relating to computational and physical technology as well as a diverse group of other enterprises. Those who possess technical skills are often referred to as "technicians," with the expression referring to audio technicians, electronics technicians, market technicians, computer technicians, engineering technicians, and a variety of other designations.



Technical skills may also refer to the expertise of a certain type of market participant who uses technical analysis signals to buy and sell stocks, bonds, futures, and other financial instruments.





Key Takeaways

Technical skills are sets of abilities or knowledge used to perform practical tasks in the areas of science, the arts, technology, engineering, and math.Technical skills typically require the use of certain tools and the technologies required to use those tools.In finance, technical skills may refer to traders and analysts who follow the procedures of technical analysis, using charts, indicators, and patterns to generate buy and sell signals.In most cases, the acquisition of advanced technical skills requires specialized training or education, which takes both time and resources.Technical skill requirements are listed for most career fields.

   Understanding Technical Skills  

Technical skills are practical ones, typically related to the fields of mechanics, information technology, mathematics, and science.



The term can refer to the ability to perform tasks that require the use of certain tools, whether tangible or intangible, and the technology required to master their intended uses in a variety of scenarios. In this regard, knowledge in a technical skills capacity is seen as practical in nature because it allows an individual to complete a designated task in a real-world, not theoretical, manner.



Given the growth of technology within worldwide and local economies, the need for diverse technical skills and knowledge is likely to continue to grow into the foreseeable future.


   What Technical Skills Are Employees Looking for?  
  Data Science  

Data science is an increasingly popular discipline, combining advanced mathematics and statistics. As more companies use data to measure performance and better understand consumer trends, the demand for data science practitioners grows. Data scientists often work alongside and have overlapping duties and responsibilities with data engineers, data analysts, and machine learning engineers.



Key technical skills for data science professionals include:



Language programming (e.g., R, Java, Python)Data visualizationStatistical analysisMachine learning



In addition to advanced technical skills, some data science jobs require professionals to have formal training or academic backgrounds in computer science, engineering, or statistics.


  Finance  

In finance, sought-after technical skills are more advanced than those in traditional business and accounting disciplines. Core financial technical skills include:



Advanced computationQuantitative analysisFinancial modeling and forecastingTechnical analysis



Technical analysis requires a variety of mathematical skills, often advanced in nature, to produce price chart analysis and model trends that look at historical information to predict future price movements.



Technical skills in this context usually refer to an individual who possesses the knowledge and expertise to complete the mathematical tasks required to gather historical data, produce a data model set, and perform directional analysis on the various outputs.



For example, to produce a linear regression model for technical analysis, the market analyst must have the skills and knowledge necessary to properly gather the historical data, perform any necessary calculations, and use the output to generate a visual representation of current and legacy historical data.



Once the linear regression is complete, the market analyst needs to have the skills and expertise to extrapolate future market activity based on the directional patterns identified in the model set(s).


  Accounting  

Akin to finance, accounting requires specific technical skills that extend beyond basic mathematics. Such skills include:



ResearchFinancial statements preparationAccounting software proficiency



Unlike the olden days when paper and pen were used for documentation, today's accounting professionals rely on a suite of software products, such as Microsoft Excel, for computing and analysis. Therefore, these workers need an advanced working knowledge of various software.



Although most accounting processes are automated, accountants still need to be proficient in understanding and preparing financial statements (e.g., balance sheets, income statements, and statements of cash flows). Central to accounting, these documents shed light on the health of a company or person's portfolio.






Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) outline the rules and regulations for US accountants, whereas the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) is the standard in other nations.



Research is another important and often overlooked technical skill needed in accounting. Some situations require extensive and independent research. For example, an accountant may need to learn how a new law affects how assets are classified or about a new accounting principle.


  Software Development  

Software developers must understand and know how to successfully create programs and applications. To become a software developer, you must be able to:



Create and edit codeUse complex softwareManipulate hardware to increase computing capabilities



Software developers must be proficient in coding, also known as software programming. Much like human languages, there are many coding languages in which a developer can be fluent. Coding translates human language into instructions the computer uses to perform specific functions.



Software developers also need to know how to organize and use data to solve computing problems or simplify processes. Along with data structure, the use of algorithms helps software developers solve issues. Computers use algorithms' step-by-step instructions to produce solutions.


   How to Improve Your Technical Skills: Education and Training  

The acquisition of advanced technical skills requires specific education or training, often with a hands-on learning component and many advanced topical elements. Technical skill requirements are listed for the majority of career fields, with the highest concentrations being employment in areas involving scientific, technological, engineering, computational, and mathematical capabilities.



Here are five steps to help you acquire or improve technical skills:


  1. Establish Career Goals  

Identifying your career goals is critical in determining what technical skills you need. If not in your desired career, your goals will likely differ from those established in their careers. Professionals who seek to stay in the same career might have goals of securing promotions or enhancing their performance. Examples of goals for those seeking career changes include:



Pursuing a career in a new fieldPursuing a new career that promotes better work-life balanceSeeking different opportunities where diversity is promoted and celebrated



Examples of goals for those occupying their desired career might include:



Increasing productivity and efficiencyPursuing opportunities with higher salariesAdvancing to higher-level positions



Because some fields, such as marketing, are multi-faceted, it might be helpful to narrow your career goals to specific roles that you wish to pursue. For example, instead of establishing a goal to pursue a career in marketing, you could set a goal to pursue a career in digital marketing.


  2. Research  

Once your goals are established, research what you need to do to accomplish them. Begin by searching the Internet for the basic and advanced technical skills of a job. The Internet can provide a wealth of information; however, you can often glean more from direct interaction. Consider interviewing or shadowing someone in the field you wish to occupy. Firsthand accounts from experienced professionals and direct observations can give you more insight than what can be gathered online.


  3. Itemize Technical Skills  

From your research, you should be prepared to document the skills you need to realize your goals. Consider the specializations, certifications, and education needed to obtain them.



Create categories and list all the associated skills that fall within each. For example, under the Certification category, you could list Lean Six Sigma or Prosci Certified Change Manager. Some skills are more important than others. Consider listing them in order of importance. Spreadsheet programs, such as Microsoft Excel, are great tools to organize your lists.


  4. Identify What You Need  

From your inventory, reorganize the skills list according to what you have versus what you need. You might be surprised to find that you already possess some of the skills needed.



Identify what you need to do to acquire or enhance technical skills. For example, if a career requires a bachelor's degree in a specific field of study, research what institutions offer that degree program. If seeking a promotion in your current field and a specialization is required, find institutions that offer the specialization.



Before enrolling in an academic program or pursuing professional certifications, consider what alternatives may be accepted in lieu of a specific requirement. For example, some jobs may list a certain degree as a requirement but will accept a degree in a related field or tenured working experience in its place.


  5. Develop Technical Skills  

Now that you know what is needed, it is time to plan and build. Develop a plan itemizing the skills you are pursuing, how you will obtain them, your timeline for completion, and resources to help you accomplish your pursuit.



Some skills can be acquired on the job, whereas some must be obtained through a formal program or training. If the latter, enroll in the program that helps you develop the skills needed and accommodates your lifestyle.






Some employers offer training courses to help their employees develop technical skills.



Sometimes, you may have enough critical technical skills to qualify for a job or promotion. Many employers will invest in skill development for the right candidates. Explore what the employer will do to help you develop your skills before undertaking expensive and time-consuming training and academic programs.


   How to List Technical Skills on a Resume  

A well-constructed resume will present the qualifications, experience, and skills that make you a qualified candidate. When including technical skills, it is important to list those pertinent to the job for which an application is submitted. Begin with the technical skills most critical to the role, and then follow with general skills.



Many employers look for basic technical skills like data analysis, management, accounting, project management, and marketing. Highly-specialized jobs may require specific technical skills that the applicant must possess to qualify.



Here are the steps to list technical skills on a resume:



Create a skills section using an appropriate heading (e.g., Skills, Technical Skills, etc.).Organize your skills in a list format, with the most relevant skills listed first.For readability and added flair, group related skills into categories. For example, a resume might have an Engineering category with the applicable skills listed beneath.For the required or preferred technical skills, highlight your expertise in the Experience section.



Not every technical skill listed in a job requisition is required. However, the more skills you have, your chances for selection are better. The right technical skills show the employer that you have what it takes to perform the job.








Which Jobs Require Technical Skills?
Many professions—such as audio technicians, electronics technicians, market technicians, computer technicians, and engineering technicians—require technical skills. Careers in the scientific, technological, engineering, computational, and mathematical fields have the highest concentrations of technical skills.




Why Are Technical Skills Important?
Most jobs require their employees to use specific tools and complete certain processes to fulfill their job duties. To do so effectively and efficiently, employees need to know how to use the tools and complete steps in a process. This adaptation is acquired through the development of hard or technical skills. Without these skills, companies lose their competitive advantage, employee satisfaction is adversely affected, and productivity suffers.




How Can I Improve My Technical Skills?
Technical skills can be improved through education and training. For example, enhancing technical skills in computer programming may require prospects to take computer programming courses and receive training on specific software applications.


   The Bottom Line  

Technical skills are the abilities and knowledge that enable someone to perform certain functions. Workers need these skills to successfully perform their day-to-day job duties. Whether attained through training or education, technical skills are essential for increased productivity and to achieve a competitive advantage.
What Is Technocracy?  

A technocracy is a model of governance wherein decision-makers are chosen for office based on their technical expertise and background. A technocracy differs from a traditional democracy in that individuals selected to a leadership role are chosen through a process that emphasizes their relevant skills and proven performance, as opposed to whether or not they fit the majority interests of a popular vote.



The individuals that occupy such positions in a technocracy are known as "technocrats." An example of a technocrat could be a central banker who is a trained economist and follows a set of rules that apply to empirical data.





Key Takeaways

A technocracy is a form of governance whereby government officials or policymakers, known as technocrats, are chosen by some higher authority due to their technical skills or expertise in a specific domain.Decisions made by technocrats are supposed to be based on information derived from data and objective methodology, rather than opinion or self-interest.Critics complain that technocracy is undemocratic and disregards the will of the people.


   How Technocracy Works  

A technocracy is a political entity ruled by experts (technocrats) that are selected or appointed by some higher authority. Technocrats are, supposedly, selected specifically for their expertise in the area over which they are delegated authority to govern. In practice, because technocrats must always be appointed by some higher authority, the political structure and incentives that influence that higher authority will always also play some role in the selection of technocrats.



An official who is labeled as a technocrat may not possess the political savvy or charisma that is typically expected of an elected politician. Instead, a technocrat may demonstrate more pragmatic and data-oriented problem-solving skills in the policy arena.



Technocracy became a popular movement in the United States during the Great Depression when it was believed that technical professionals, such as engineers and scientists, would have a better understanding than politicians regarding the economy's inherent complexity.






Although democratically officials may hold seats of authority, most come to rely on the technical expertise of select professionals in order to execute their plans.



Defense measures and policies in government are often developed with considerable consultation with military personnel to provide their firsthand insight. Medical treatment decisions, meanwhile, are based heavily on the input and knowledge of physicians, and city infrastructures could not be planned, designed, or constructed without the input of engineers.


   Critiques of Technocracy  

Reliance on technocracy can be criticized on several grounds. The acts and decisions of technocrats can come into conflict with the will, rights, and interests of the people whom they rule over. This in turn has often led to populist opposition to both specific technocratic policy decisions and to the degree of power in general granted to technocrats. These problems and conflicts help give rise to the populist concept of the "deep state", which consists of a powerful, entrenched, unaccountable, and oligarchic technocracy which governs in its own interests.



In a democratic society, the most obvious criticism is that there is an inherent tension between technocracy and democracy. Technocrats often may not follow the will of the people because by definition they may have specialized expertise that the general population lacks. Technocrats may or may not be accountable to the will of the people for such decisions.



In a government where citizens are guaranteed certain rights, technocrats may seek to encroach upon these rights if they believe that their specialized knowledge suggests that it is appropriate or in the larger public interest. The focus on science and technical principles might also be seen as separate and disassociated from the humanity and nature of society. For instance, a technocrat might make decisions based on calculations of data rather than the impact on the populace, individuals, or groups within the population.



In any government, regardless of who appoints the technocrats or how, there is always a risk that technocrats will engage in policymaking that favors their own interests or others whom they serve over the public interest. Technocrats are necessarily placed in a position of trust, since the knowledge used to enact their decisions is to some degree inaccessible or not understandable to the general public. This creates a situation where there can be a high risk of self-dealing, collusion, corruption, and cronyism. Economic problems such as rent-seeking, rent-extraction, or regulatory capture are common in technocracy.
What Is the Technology, Media, and Telecom (TMT) Sector?  

The technology, media, and telecom (TMT) sector is an industry grouping that includes the majority of companies focused on new technologies. There is a substantial overlap between TMT and the 1990s idea of the new economy. The TMT sector is sometimes also referred to as technology, media, and communications (TMC).



The technology sector can no longer hold all the firms that depend on innovation because the role of technology in the economy has expanded. For example, Meta (META), formerly Facebook, and Netflix (NFLX) are both in the Communication Services Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLC) rather than the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLK). Big tech companies increasingly dominate the TMT sector.





Key Takeaways

The technology, media, and telecom (TMT) sector is an industry grouping that includes companies focused on new technologies.The TMT sector includes a wide range of companies that depend on research & development (R&D).By getting in early on stocks in the TMT industry, growth investors hope to achieve higher returns.Since the TMT segment is so broad, it's often divided into subsectors, including hardware, semiconductors, software, media, and telecom.


   Understanding the TMT Sector  

The TMT sector includes a wide range of companies that depend on research & development (R&D). They focus on patents and other intellectual property and prefer rapid company growth. As a result, investors in the TMT sector often tolerate relatively high price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios in favor of enterprise-value-to-sales (EV/Sales).



The TMT sector is beneficial to growth investors looking for potential tenbaggers that will dramatically outperform the market. New technologies are continually developed in the TMT sector, and some companies may eventually become big names in the sector. By getting in early on stocks in the TMT industry, growth investors hope to achieve higher returns.






Many TMT stocks have high potential to outperform the market, but they also face greater downside risks.


   Special Considerations  

Because this industry segment covers a broad range, it is often helpful to divide TMT into subsectors, such as hardware, semiconductors, software, media, and telecom. The TMT sector contains new and hi-tech firms, so it experiences many mergers, acquisitions, and initial public offerings (IPOs). Each subsector also has different growth metrics and prospects. For example, the telecom sector is driven by the shift toward wireless.



The hardware companies include computer makers—IBM, Dell, and HP—but also makers of server systems, mobile device handsets, tablets, and storage devices such as hard drives and memory. Within hardware, semiconductor manufacturers develop and produce integrated circuits and microchips used in all sorts of applications. Some representative firms include Intel, AMD, Texas Instruments, and Nvidia.



Software companies produce computer or mobile applications for both individuals and enterprises. Microsoft, Adobe, and SAP rank among the top software firms.



Furthermore, media and telecom companies also play essential parts in the TMT sector. Media firms develop, produce, and distribute multimedia content on TV, in print, and online. Television networks, cable TV providers, production studios, and social media companies are all in this subsector. Finally, telecom focuses on communications-related businesses such as phone, TV, and internet service providers. There are several significant telecoms, such as AT&T and Verizon, that dominate the industry.


   Examples of Technology, Media, and Telecom Sector  

Market participants may categorize TMT companies in different subsectors, so there are many examples of companies in multiple TMT subsectors. Meta may be viewed as either an internet company or a media company. Apple can be placed in the internet, hardware, software, or media category, depending on who is judging the company.



Other examples that cross subsectors are Hulu, Amazon, and Netflix. Sometimes, companies in one subsector of TMT will merge or acquire another to consolidate, diversify, and broaden product offerings.



Examples of mergers include the AOL and Time Warner merger in 2000. In 2015, AT&T and DIRECTV joined forces, while the Dell-EMC merger happened in 2016.
What Is the Technology Sector?  

The technology sector is the category of stocks relating to the research, development, or distribution of technologically based goods and services. This sector contains businesses revolving around the manufacturing of electronics, creation of software, computers, or products and services relating to information technology.





Key Takeaways

The technology sector is comprised of businesses that sell goods and services in electronics, software, computers, artificial intelligence, and other industries related to information technology (IT).Tech companies invest heavily in research and development and may undertake riskier projects with greater future potential.Tech companies run social media platforms like Facebook, X platform (formerly Twitter), and Instagram.Companies rely on the technology sector to help them grow and thrive.The technology sector is often one of the most attractive growth investments in an economy.







Investing In the Tech Industry


   Understanding the Technology Sector  

The technology sector offers a wide range of products and services for both customers and other businesses. Consumer goods like personal computers, mobile devices, wearable technology, home appliances, televisions, and so on are continually being improved and sold to consumers with new features.



On the business side, companies are dependent on innovations coming out of the technology sector to create their enterprise software, manage their logistics systems, protect their databases, and generally provide the critical information and services that allow companies to make strategic business decisions. The term "technology sector" is frequently shortened to tech sector and is used interchangeably with the term "technology industry or tech industry."



The technology sector is often the most attractive investment destination in any economy. The U.S. technology sector boasts of companies like Apple, Google, Amazon, Netflix, IBM, and Microsoft. These companies drive the growth in the tech sector, and the enthusiasm around their long-term potential has them trading at price-to-earnings multiples that look ridiculous compared to almost every other sector.






A large amount of this growth owes a debt to the buzz factor that technology companies create by launching business lines that have never existed before.






   Growth in the Technology Sector  

The term technology sector has been broadened many times to include businesses that may be better served by a more specific category. The technology sector was initially anchored in semiconductors, computing hardware, and communications equipment. In addition, growth also includes jobs. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, jobs in computer and information technology are poised to grow 13% between 2020 and 2030.



The addition of software companies expanded the perceived tech sector to include anything based on coding. Soon, more room had to be made for internet companies, which flooded during the Internet boom. Some of these internet companies were media and content companies that used code as the medium. Still, others were off launching rich features that grew to be e-commerce, social media, the sharing economy, and even cloud-based computing.



The technology sector now includes such a diverse set of companies that the subsectors are far more useful than the overall one. Unsurprisingly, there is no universal agreement—some pundits want a whole new sector for each innovation—but the big buckets include semiconductors, software, networking, Internet, and hardware.



From there, all the subsectors can be further broken down. For example, hardware breaks into wearables, peripherals, laptops, desktops, and so on. People may argue that it doesn't make sense to call a cloud computing company a software company, but the arbitrary separations are a bit more manageable than the massive label of "tech sector" for every company.




What's the Difference Between a Sector and an Industry?
In general, an industry is a group of companies that are all similar in type. A sector is a segment of the broader economy. For example, the semiconductor industry is part of the technology sector. However, these terms are often used interchangeably.




What Are Industries Within the Technology Sector?
There are three main industries within the technology sector. These are software and services, semiconductors and semiconductor equipment, and technology hardware and equipment. Each of these areas can be further broken down into sub-industries.




is Social Media Part of the Technology Sector?
Social media is an industry within the technology sector. Some of the most well-known tech companies are those that run social media platforms, such as Meta and X. Many of these tech companies pursue other projects in addition to social media, so they can belong to other industries within the technology sector as well.


   The Bottom Line  

The technology sector is the part of the economy made up of businesses that focus on electronics, software, computers, social media, and other industries related to information technology. These companies often invest in developing new projects with future potential, even without an immediate payoff.



Many parts of the public and private sectors rely on products and services developed by technology companies. The tech sector is often a growth part of the economy.
What Is the TED Spread?  

The TED spread is the difference between the three-month Treasury bill and the three-month LIBOR based in U.S. dollars. To put it another way, the TED spread is the difference between the interest rate on short-term U.S. government debt and the interest rate on interbank loans.



TED is an acronym for the Treasury-EuroDollar rate.





Key Takeaways

The TED spread is the difference between the three-month LIBOR and the three-month Treasury bill rate.The TED spread is commonly used as a measure of credit risk, as U.S. Treasury bills are seen as risk-free.The TED spread often widens in periods of economic crisis, as the default risk widens; the spread narrows when the economy is more stable and defaults are less of a risk.


   Understanding the Ted Spread  

The TED spread was originally calculated as the price difference between three-month futures contracts on U.S. Treasuries and three-month contracts for Eurodollars with identical expiration months. After futures on Treasury bills (T-bills) were dropped by the Chicago Mercantile Exchange (CME) following the 1987 stock market crash, the TED spread was amended. It is calculated as the difference between the interest rate banks can lend to each other over a three-month time frame and the interest rate at which the government is able to borrow money for a three-month period.



The TED spread is used as an indicator of credit risk. This is because U.S. T-bills are considered risk free and measure an ultra-safe bet—the U.S. government’s creditworthiness. In addition, the LIBOR is a dollar-denominated gauge used to reflect the credit ratings of corporate borrowers or the credit risk that large international banks assume when they lend money to each other. By comparing the risk-free rate to any other interest rate, an analyst can determine the perceived difference in risk. Following this construct, the TED spread can be understood as the difference between the interest rate that investors demand from the government for investing in short-term Treasuries and the interest rate that investors charge large banks.






According to an announcement by the Federal Reserve on November 30, 2020, banks should stop writing contracts using LIBOR by the end of 2021. The Intercontinental Exchange, the authority responsible for LIBOR, will stop publishing one week and two month LIBOR after December 31, 2021. All contracts using LIBOR must be wrapped up by June 30, 2023.﻿﻿



As the TED spread increases, the default risk on interbank loans is considered to be increasing. Interbank lenders will demand a higher rate of interest or will be willing to accept lower returns on safe investments such as T-bills. In other words, the higher the liquidity or solvency risk posed by one or more banks, the higher the rate lenders or investors will require on their loans to other banks compared to loans to the government. As the spread decreases, the default risk is considered to be decreasing. In this case, investors will sell T-bills and reinvest the proceeds in the stock market which is perceived to offer a better rate of return on investments.


   Calculation and Example of the TED Spread  

The TED spread is a relatively simple calculation:



TED Spread = 3-month LIBOR – 3-month T-bill rate



Of course, it is far easier to let the St. Louis Fed calculate and chart it for you.



Typically, the size of the spread is designated in basis points (bps). For example, if the T-bill rate is 1.43% and LIBOR is 1.79%, the TED spread is 36 bps. The TED spread fluctuates over time but generally has remained within the range of 10 and 50 bps. However, this spread can increase over a wider range during times of crisis in the economy.



For example, following the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008, the TED spread peaked at 450 basis points. A downturn in the economy indicates to banks that other banks may encounter solvency problems, leading banks to restrict interbank lending. This, in turn, leads to a wider TED spread and lower credit availability for individual and corporate borrowers in the economy.
What Is a Telegraphic Transfer (TT)?  

A telegraphic transfer (TT) is an electronic method of transferring funds used primarily for overseas wire transactions. These transfers are used most commonly with Clearing House Automated Payment System (CHAPS) transfers in the U.K. banking system. Telegraphic transfers are also known as telex transfers.





Key Takeaways

A telegraphic transfer is an electronic method of transferring funds, used primarily for overseas wire transactions.Telegraphic transfers are used most often with Clearing House Automated Payment System (CHAPS) transfers in the U.K. banking system.Typically, a telegraphic transfer is complete within two to four business days, depending on the origin and destination of the transfer, as well as any currency-exchange requirements.Telegraphic transfers are also known as telex transfers (TT), or more generically as wire transfers or electronic funds transfers.


   Understanding a Telegraphic Transfer (TT)  

Originally, as the name suggests, telegraphs were used to communicate transfers between financial institutions. The sender went to their bank and provided the required data about the amount sent and the recipient. An operator at that bank would send a message to the recipient’s bank using Morse code. 



While the telegraph itself has become obsolete, the telegraphic transfer concept has remained—although it has evolved with changing technologies and uses secure cable networks to transfer funds. At times, the transfer mechanism may be referred to by the more general term "wire transfer," or by the updated term "electronic funds transfer" (EFT).



Telegraphic transfers are usually fairly expensive, sometimes including multiple fees, due to the fast nature of the transaction. Generally, the telegraphic transfer is complete within two to four business days, depending on the origin and destination of the transfer, as well as any currency-exchange requirements.



Funds sent between institutions are transferred through the Federal Reserve System for U.S. domestic transfers and the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT) network for international transfers.






SWIFT (the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication) was launched in 1973. The system facilitated cross-border transfers between banks by introducing uniform standards, which made transactions less prone to error and able to move swiftly.



While the term can refer to both U.S. domestic and international transfers, TTs are most commonly associated with transfers through SWIFT. The use of these systems provides a level of security to the transaction as well as a set of standards and regulations to control how the transfers take place.



The cost associated with a telegraphic transfer can also be affected by these variables. Additional factors influencing the cost can include the amount being transferred and the institution chosen to complete the transaction.






Associated fees to complete the transfer aren't standardized across all institutions and can thus vary dramatically from one institution to the next.


   Information Required for Telegraphic Transfers  

Certain information regarding the sender and destination is required to complete the transfer. Whether a person transfers funds between two accounts that are both held in their name, or between two accounts held by two different individuals, the most pertinent information required for the transfer is the relevant account numbers and details of the corresponding financial institutions.



Personal identifiable information is also required for security purposes and to confirm the identity of the sender. Similar requirements exist for business entities, but the identifiable information relates to the business, instead of the individual.




Why Was It Called Telegraphic Transfer (TT)?
Originally, money transfers between financial institutions were once accomplished over telegraph wires. Because the telegraph itself has become obsolete, the telegraphic transfer concept has evolved with changing technologies. Now, funds move via cable networks or cloud-based apps.




What Are the Key Characteristics of a Telegraphic Transfer?
Telegraphic transfers provide a level of security as well as a set of standards and regulations to control how the transfers take place. Generally, the TT is complete within two to four business days, depending on the origin and destination of the transfer, as well as any currency exchange requirements. TTs are also usually fairly expensive—the price one pays for the rapid service.




How Are Telegraphic Transfers Processed?
TTs are used most commonly in connection with Clearing House Automated Payment System (CHAPS) transfers in the U.K. banking system. U.S. domestic transfers of funds sent between institutions are transferred through the Federal Reserve System, while international transfers use the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT).




What Information Is Needed for a Telegraphic Transfer (TT)?
The most pertinent information required for the telegraphic transfer is the account numbers and routing numbers of the parties and the financial institutions involved. Then there is the amount of money being transferred and the bank or non-bank transfer provider, such as Western Union, that is chosen to actually carry out the transaction (though, strictly speaking, TTs are carried out between two banks and don't involve third parties). Other details may also be required for security purposes and to confirm the identity of the sender.


   The Bottom Line  

A telegraphic transfer (TT) is an electronic way of transferring funds that is used primarily for overseas wire transactions. Usually, a telegraphic transfer is complete in two to four business days, depending on the origin and destination of the transfer. Telegraphic transfers are also known as telex transfers (TT), or more generically as wire transfers or electronic funds transfers. TTs are usually fairly expensive, sometimes charging multiple fees, due to the fast nature of the transfer.
What Is the Temporal Method?  

The temporal method (also known as the historical method) converts the currency of a foreign subsidiary into the currency of the parent company. This technique of foreign currency translation is used when the local currency of the subsidiary is not the same as the currency of the parent company. Differing exchange rates are used depending on the financial statement item being translated.


   Understanding the Temporal Method  

When a company has operations or subsidiaries in a country other than where the parent company is domiciled, the parent company must convert the values on the foreign entity's financial statements back into the parent company's currency in order to calculate its profits and losses and generate the financial statements. The currency used by the parent company is sometimes referred to as the subsidiary’s "functional currency" or "reporting currency." 





Key Takeaways

The temporal method is used to convert the currency of a foreign subsidiary into the same currency as the parent company.The parent company's currency is called the functional currency.The currency translation technique allows the parent company to report profits or losses and file financial statements when it has subsidiaries outside of the country where it is domiciled.Gains or losses due to exchange rate conversions are reported in the parent company's net earnings.



If the subsidiary's functional currency differs from its local currency, the temporal method is used to perform currency translations. Exchange rate values are based on the time assets and liabilities are acquired or incurred, which makes it possible to convert the numbers on the books of an integrated foreign entity into the parent company's currency.



Monetary assets and liabilities are converted using the exchange rate in effect as of the balance sheet date. Non-monetary assets and liabilities are converted using the exchange rate in effect on the date of the transaction. Gains and losses due to foreign exchange are reported in net earnings.


   Example of the Temporal Method  

An example of the temporal method would be subsidiary XYZ being domiciled in Great Britain. The local currency of XYZ is the British pound. However, if the majority of XYZ's clients reside in continental Europe, then it may conduct its business in euros. The euro would be the functional currency. In this instance, the parent company of XYZ would use the temporal method to translate XYZ's financial statements back into the currency used by the parent company.



Monetary assets such as accounts receivable, investments, and cash are converted to the parent's currency at the exchange rate in effect on the balance sheet date. Non-monetary assets are longer-term assets—such as property, plant, and equipment—are converted using the exchange rate in effect on the date the asset was obtained. Since all foreign exchange gains and losses are reported in net earnings of the parent company, the result can be an increase in the volatility of the parent company's earnings if it has substantial income coming from subsidiaries in different countries.
What Is Tenancy at Sufferance?  

Tenancy at sufferance is created when a tenant has overstayed their lease term without a new agreement. In this case, the landlord can hold them to the terms of the old lease and collect rent payments for the time overstayed. This can continue until the landlord is able to obtain an eviction order, or decides to extend the lease.



This can be contrasted with tenancy at will, where a tenant occupies the property with the consent of the owner but without necessarily a written contract or lease.


   Understanding Tenancy at Sufferance  

Tenancy at sufferance (also called "estate at sufferance" or "holdover tenancy") arises when a tenant who has a lawful possession of a property (for example, a lease) holds over without the owner's consent. The only difference between a holdover tenant at sufferance and a trespasser is that the tenant entered into possession in a legal manner but has now overstayed his or her welcome.



Each state may have different legal definitions and criteria to determine whether or not an occupant is classified as a trespasser if they remain on a property they previously had a lease agreement for.





Key Takeaways

Tenancy at sufferance refers to holdover tenants of an expired lease who no longer have the landlord's permission to remain in the property, but who have not yet been evicted.The term sufferance means the absence of objection without genuine approval.A holdover tenant at sufferance may be subject to eviction, and depending on state law may be accused of trespassing.


   Ways a Tenancy of Sufferance Can Be Put into Effect  

The circumstance that can lead to a tenancy of sufferance can include eviction proceedings. This can be the case if a tenant’s lease agreement comes to an end, but they do not vacate the premises and the landlord intends to lease the space to new occupants. The landlord or property owner may initiate their legal options to remove the tenant from the property but the tenant continues to dwell on the property and usually cannot be forcibly removed.



While the eviction process is underway, the tenant must comply with the rental or lease terms. However, in some jurisdictions a landlord should not accept rent during this time as it may constitute an extension of the lease agreement. Evictions could take a relatively short time or take several months depending on the jurisdiction. The property owner would have to accept the tenancy at sufferance throughout that period.



It is possible that the property owner will offer to buy out the tenant in order to see them exit the property. This might be a more expensive option, but it would expedite a resolution to the situation. If such a buyout is accepted, the tenancy at sufferance would end and the tenant would have to vacate the premises.



A property owner could also offer a new lease agreement. Acceptance of a new lease by all parties would also end a tenancy at sufferance and the tenant would be bound to the terms of the new agreement.
What Is a Tenancy-at-Will?  

A tenancy-at-will is a property tenure that can be terminated at any time by either the tenant or the owner/landlord. It exists without a contract or lease and usually does not specify the duration of a tenant’s rental or the exchange of payment. The agreement is governed by state law and the terms can vary by state, though federal law comes into play in cases of discrimination.﻿﻿ ﻿﻿



“Estate-at-will” is another name for a tenancy-at-will. The estate-at-will or tenancy-at-will agreement is generally beneficial to both tenants and owners, who may wish to have the flexibility to change rental situations easily and without breaking a contract.





Key Takeaways

A tenancy-at-will is an agreement between a landlord and a tenant without a written agreement.This type of tenancy does not specify its duration or the exchange of payment and can be terminated at any time.Tenants and landlords may find these types of arrangements flexible because they allow for changes to rentals without breaking a contract.


   How a Tenancy-at-Will Works  

Tenants who have permission from their landlords but don’t have leases generally have a tenancy-at-will. These tenancies are sometimes called “month-to-month” or “at-will” agreements, as there is no formal contract specifying the length of time during which the tenancy will take place.



A tenancy-at-will defines the relationship between the landlord and tenant when strict terms—such as those contained within a lease agreement—are not present, are defective in nature, or have expired. A tenancy-at-will agreement may also be created at the beginning of the landlord-tenant relationship.



Tenancies-at-will are effective if there is an oral agreement in lieu of a written one between the two parties, if there is a written agreement stating either that the tenancy is on a month-to-month basis or there is no specified timeline, or if the tenancy is continued after the original lease expires without signing a new one.﻿﻿



Tenancies-at-will generally involve parties who are known to each other. In some cases they make take place between family members.


  Holdover tenants  

A tenant-at-will is different from a holdover tenant, even though both lack a formal rental agreement. A holdover tenant typically stays on after a fixed-term agreement that has expired—sometimes without the landlord’s permission. If the landlord continues to accept rental payments, the tenant can legally occupy the unit. If not, the tenant is considered a trespasser and must move out. If they don’t, the landlord can begin eviction proceedings.


   Tenancy-at-Will Protections  

Both parties are afforded certain legal protections governing the relationship even in the absence of a written agreement. Just one example: The landlord must provide a safe environment as required by law. Additionally, the landlord must provide notice prior to entering the tenant-occupied property as governed by local statutes.﻿﻿



The tenant also has certain unspoken responsibilities they must fulfill even under a tenancy-at-will. Rent payments must be made, and the tenant must adhere to any rules they have agreed upon with the landlord. The tenant is also responsible for any damages beyond normal wear and tear on the property. Both parties must follow local regulations when it comes to vacating or having the property vacated.






Even though there is no formal agreement, a notice to vacate is normally required to terminate a tenancy-at-will.


   Vacating a Tenancy-at-Will  

While a tenancy-at-will arrangement may not have written and agreed-upon requirements regarding notification of intention to vacate, terms are generally spelled out within local landlord-tenant regulations. It is not uncommon for a 30-day notice to apply to both the tenant and landlord. This means that if the tenant intends to vacate, or the landlord wants the tenant to vacate, 30 days’ notice must be supplied to the other party. A reason for the request to vacate is not required to be cited by either party. The notice is traditionally provided in writing.



In Maine, for example, landlords in an at-will arrangement can evict tenants without giving a reason, but they must give a 30-day written notice of the intended eviction. But under certain circumstances, which include serious damage to the premises, being a nuisance to neighbors, being a perpetrator of domestic violence or sexual assault, and being at least seven days in arrears for rent, a landlord can give a tenant a seven-day notice to vacate for a tenancy-at-will agreement in the state of Maine.



There are also circumstances when a tenancy-at-will can be terminated without the need for a notice to vacate. If the tenant or property owner dies, or the landlord decides to sell the property, the tenancy agreement is nullified.


   Types of Tenancies  

There are generally four different types of tenancies, including the tenancy-at-will.﻿﻿



In a tenancy-for-years, the agreement is for a fixed period of time. It has a specified beginning and termination date, at which point the tenant is expected to vacate the premises. As the lease’s end date is already set, there is generally no need for a notice to vacate. However, the landlord may choose to renew the lease.



A periodic tenancy allows a tenant to remain within the property for an undetermined period of time, as the lease has no set end date. The lease, however, typically stipulates when notice to vacate is required, and both parties are bound to adhere to that clause.



Another kind of tenancy is tenancy-at-sufferance. In this type of agreement, a tenant may legally occupy a property after their lease expires but before the landlord issues a notice to vacate. The tenant has thus overstayed their welcome.
What Is Tenancy by the Entirety?  

Tenancy by the entirety refers to a form of shared property ownership that is reserved only for married couples. A tenancy by the entirety permits spouses to jointly own property as a single legal entity. This means that each spouse has an equal and undivided interest in the property.



This form of legal ownership creates a right of survivorship so if one spouse dies, the surviving spouse automatically receives full title to the property.





Key Takeaways

Tenancy by the entirety is a form of property ownership reserved only for married couples.Each spouse has a legal right to an equal portion of the property provided they were married at the time title was received in both their names.This arrangement creates a right of survivorship, so when one spouse dies, their interest in the property is automatically transferred to the surviving spouse.Creditors cannot enforce a lien on any property that falls under a tenancy by the entirety if only one spouse owns the debt.


   How Tenancy by the Entirety Works  

Tenancy by the entirety can only occur when the property owners are married to one another at the time they receive the title. This type of legal agreement doesn't apply to other partnerships, such as friends, siblings, parent-child relationships, or business associates.



Spouses who mutually own property through tenancy by the entirety are referred to as tenants by entirety. Each spouse legally has equal rights to ownership of the property in question. This allows them to inhabit and use the property as they see fit.



The condition of mutual ownership of the entire property means the spouses must be in agreement when making decisions about the property. For example, one spouse doesn't have the legal right to sell off or develop part of the property without the other’s consent.






There is no subdivision that separates the property into equal parts between the spouses. So, even if one spouse writes a will that grants an interest stake in the property to an heir, the power and rights of tenancy by the entirety creates a right of survivorship and invalidates and supersedes that aspect of the will.


   Requirements of Tenancy by the Entirety  

In order to become tenants by the entirety of a certain property, the prospective tenants must be married at the time they come into ownership of the property. Specific requirements vary from state to state; some states extend tenancy by the entirety to domestic partners or common-law spouses.



The establishment of tenancy by the entirety differs across jurisdictions as well. In some states, any married couple that buys property is assumed to be tenants in the entirety. Some states may limit tenancy to entirety to real estate only, or only to homestead property.


   Advantages and Disadvantages of Tenancy by the Entirety  

The main advantage of a tenancy by the entirety is to protect the interests of a surviving spouse. When one tenant dies, there is no possibility that their partner will lose the property. There is no need for the property to go through probate, and no other heir can evict the surviving spouse.



But a tenancy by the entirety only prevents the property from being probated if a single spouse dies. When the surviving spouse dies, the property must be probated as normal. The same is true if both spouses die together.



However, tenancy by the entirety is not available in all states, and it is sometimes restricted to real estate only. Moreover, the couple must own equal shares and be in agreement about any decision covering a property. This can cause issues in some relationships.



While tenancy by the entirety protects the property from claims against one spouse, it does not protect it from all claims. If there is a debt that both tenants are responsible for, the creditor can still make a claim against the property.




Pros and Cons of Tenancy by the Entirety

Pros

Allows one married partner to inherit the property without probate if their partner dies.
Protects the property from any claims against the deceased partner's estate.
Prevents either partner from placing liens or selling the shared property.



Cons

Limited to some states, and may be limited to some types of property.
Does not protect the property from claims against shared debts.
Both partners must have equal stakes, and be in agreement about any decisions concerning the property.
Property must still be probated after the second spouse dies.





   Tenancy by the Entirety vs. Joint Tenancy  

A tenancy by the entirety is similar to a joint tenancy, where a property is co-owned by two or more people. In both types of tenancy, there is a right of survivorship: Upon the death of one owner, their share is automatically passed on to the other tenant, rather than being probated with their estate.



However, there are some differences. While tenants in the entirety are usually required to be a married couple, joint tenants can have any type of relationship: siblings, business partners, or even friends.



Moreover, while a tenancy by the entirety can only be terminated by mutual agreement (or the death of a spouse), a joint tenancy can unilaterally be ended by any one of the tenants: All they need to do is sell or transfer their share to another person, who then becomes a tenant in common.


   States That Allow Tenancy by the Entirety  

Each state has its own laws that govern tenancy by the entirety and how it may be applied. Though some states allow this form of ownership to exist for all types of property held by married couples, others only allow it to be exercised for real estate that is jointly owned by spouses. Some states also permit domestic partners to jointly own property through tenancy by the entirety.



Twenty-five states and Washington D.C. allow tenancy by the entirety. The states that permit it are:



AlaskaArkansasDelawareFloridaHawaiiIllinoisIndianaKentuckyMarylandMassachusettsMichiganMississippiMissouriNew JerseyNew YorkNorth CarolinaOhioOklahomaOregonPennsylvaniaRhode IslandTennesseeVermontVirginiaWyoming






Other possible structures under which spouses can choose to jointly own property include tenancy in common (TIC) and joint tenancy.


   How Is Tenancy by the Entirety Terminated?  

Tenancy by the entirety can be terminated in one of several ways:



Spouses mutually agree to end the arrangementWhen a spouse diesWhen a couple divorces



As mentioned above, a tenancy by the entirety creates a right of survivorship. In other words, when one spouse dies, that person's share in the property is automatically transferred to the surviving spouse. This eliminates the need for probate.



When a couple divorces, the parties become tenants in common (TIC). This means they both have ownership rights in the property and can bequeath their share of the property to anyone upon their death. Courts can order the sale of the property with the proceeds split between the divorcing couple or award full ownership to one party.


   Rights of Tenants by Entirety  

Tenancy by the entirety forbids one party from selling the property without the other party’s consent. Suppose a married couple purchases a house together through a tenancy by entirety arrangement. Because the couple purchased the property together, each would have a 100% ownership interest.



This status also protects the spouses against certain liens. Creditors who seek relief on delinquent debt cannot enter claims against any property that is under tenancy by the entirety unless the couple shares that debt. The property can only be attached by creditors to whom the married couple owes joint debts.



For example, if a borrower owes payments on a motorcycle they acquired only for themselves, the lender could not put a lien against a house the borrower owns with a spouse because the property is under tenancy by the entirety.


   Frequently Asked Questions  


What Does Tenancy by the Entirety Mean?
Tenancy by the entirety is a type of property ownership that only applies to married couples. The couple is treated as a single legal entity and mutually co-owns the property. The consent of each is needed to sell or develop it. A tenancy by the entirety also creates a right of survivorship—when one spouse dies the surviving spouse gains full ownership of the property. About half of the U.S. states allow tenancy by the entirety and some permit it for domestic partners too.




What Happens When a Couple Divorces?
If a couple divorces, they become tenants in common, which gives them both ownership rights in the property. A court can also order the sale of the property—the proceeds would be split between the ex-spouses—or grant full ownership to one spouse.




What Are the Benefits of Tenancy by the Entirety?
One major benefit of tenancy by the entirety is that creditors can’t place a lien on the property if only one spouse holds the debt. Also, because of the automatic survivorship rights this arrangement provides, there is no need for probate, which can be costly and time-consuming. 


   The Bottom Line  

Tenancy by the entirety is a legal arrangement where a married couple shares equal ownership of a property, and ownership automatically passes to the survivor if their partner dies. This allows the survivor to avoid probate and protects the home from any claims against the other tenant. However, this form of co-ownership is only available in some states.
What Is Tenancy in Common (TIC)?  

Tenancy in Common (TIC) is a legal arrangement in which two or more parties share ownership rights in a real estate property or parcel of land. Each independent owner may control an equal or different percentage of the total property, whether commercial or residential. The parties are known as tenants in common.



Tenancy in Common is one of three types of shared ownership. The other two types are Joint Tenancy and Tenancy by Entirety. A TIC has no right of survivorship and when a tenant in common dies, their share of the property passes to their estate, where a beneficiary of the share of property may be named.





Key Takeaways

Tenancy in Common (TIC) is a legal arrangement in which two or more parties have ownership interests in a real estate property or parcel of land.Tenants in common can own different percentages of the property.Tenants in common can bequeath their share of the property to a named beneficiary upon their death.Joint Tenancy and Tenancy by Entirety are two other types of ownership agreements.


   How Tenancy in Common (TIC) Works  

Owners as tenants in common share interests and privileges in all areas of the property, however, each tenant can own a different percentage or proportional financial share of the property.



Tenancy in Common agreements can be created at any time and an individual may join as an interest in a property after the other members have already entered into a TIC arrangement. Each tenant can also independently sell or borrow against their portion of ownership.






While the percentage of the property owned varies, a tenant in common cannot claim ownership to any specific part of the property.


   Dissolving Tenancy in Common  

One or more tenants can buy out other members to dissolve the Tenancy in Common in a joint agreement. In cases where an understanding cannot be reached, a partition action may take place that may be voluntary or court-ordered.



In a legal partition proceeding, a court will divide the property as a partition in kind, separating the property into parts that are individually owned and managed by each party without compelling a person to sell his property against his will. 



If the tenants refuse to work together, they may consider entering into a partition of the property by sale. In this case, the holding is sold and the proceeds are divided among the tenants according to their respective share of the property.


   Property Taxes Under Tenancy in Common  

Because a Tenancy in Common agreement does not legally divide a parcel of land or property, most tax jurisdictions will not separately assign each owner a proportional property tax bill based on their ownership percentage. Most often, the tenants in common receive a single property tax bill.



In many jurisdictions, a TIC agreement imposes joint-and-several liability on the tenants where each of the independent owners may be liable for the property tax up to the full amount of the assessment. The liability applies to each owner regardless of the level or percentage of ownership.



Tenants can deduct payments from their income tax filings. If the taxing jurisdiction followed joint-and-several liability, each tenant can deduct the amount they contributed. In counties that do not follow this procedure, they can deduct a percentage of the total tax up to their level of ownership.


   Joint Tenancy and Tenancy by Entirety  

Besides Tenancy in Common, two additional forms of shared ownership are commonly used: Joint Tenancy and Tenancy by Entirety.



In a Joint Tenancy, tenants obtain equal shares of a property with the same deed at the same time. With two tenants, each owns 50%. If one party would like to buy out the other, the property must be sold and the proceeds distributed equally.



In Tenancy in Common, the ownership portion passes to the individual's estate at death. In Joint Tenancy, the title of the property passes to the surviving owner.



Some states set Joint Tenancy as the default property ownership for married couples, while others use the Tenancy in Common model. A third method, used in some states, is Tenancy by Entirety in which each spouse has an equal and undivided interest in the property.



In Tenants by Entirety, both parties have equal, 100% interest in the property as if each is a full owner. If a married couple is in a TBE agreement, the property is viewed as owned by one entity.






Contract terms for Tenancy in Common are detailed in the deed, title, or other legally binding property ownership documents.


   Pros and Cons of Tenancy in Common  

Buying a home with a family member or business partner may make it easier to enter the real estate market. Dividing deposits, payments, and maintenance make real estate investment less expensive for an individual buyer.



However, when mortgaging property as tenants in common, all borrowers sign and agree to the loan agreement, and in the case of default, the lender may seize the holdings from all tenants. If one or more borrowers stop paying their share of the mortgage loan payment, the other borrowers are still responsible for the full payment of the loan.



Using a will to designate beneficiaries to the property gives a tenant control over their share. However, the remaining tenants may subsequently own the property with someone they do not know or with whom they do not agree. The heir may file a partition action, forcing unwilling tenants to sell or divide the property.





Pros

Facilitates property purchases
Number of tenants can change
Different degrees of ownership possible



Cons

No automatic survivorship rights
All tenants equally liable for debt and taxes
One tenant can force sale of property





   Example of Tenancy in Common  

California allows four types of ownership that include Community Property, Partnership, Joint Tenancy, and Tenancy in Common. TIC is the default form among unmarried parties or individuals who jointly acquired property.



These owners have the status of tenants in common unless their agreement or contract expressly states otherwise as a Partnership or Joint Tenancy.



TIC is one of the most common types of homeownership in San Francisco, according to SirkinLaw, a San Francisco real estate law firm specializing in co-ownership. They maintain that TIC conversions have become increasingly popular in other parts of California too, including Oakland, Berkeley, Santa Monica, Hollywood, Laguna Beach, San Diego, and throughout Marin and Sonoma counties.




What Benefit Does Tenancy in Common Provide?
Tenancy in common (TIC) is a legal arrangement in which two or more parties jointly own a piece of real property, such as a building or parcel of land. The key feature of a TIC is that either party can sell their share of the property while also reserving the right to pass on their share of the property to their heirs.




What Happens When One of the Tenants in Common Dies?
The ownership share of the deceased tenant is passed on to that tenant’s estate and handled in accordance with the deceased tenant’s will. Any surviving tenants continue owning and occupying the property.




What Is a Common Dispute Among Tenants In Common?
TIC tenants share equal rights to use the entire property regardless of their ownership percentage of the property. Maintenance and care are divided evenly despite ownership share. Problems often arise when a minority owner overuses or misuses the property.


   The Bottom Line  

Tenancy in Common is one of three types of ownership where two or more parties, referred to as tenants in common, share interests in real estate or land. Owners as tenants in common share interests and privileges in all areas of the property regardless of each tenant's financial or proportional share of the property. Two other types of ownership agreements are Joint Tenancy and Tenancy by Entirety.
What Are Tenants by Entirety (TBE)?  

Tenants by entirety (TBE) is a method in some states by which married couples can hold the title to a property. In order for one spouse to modify his or her interest in the property in any way, the consent of both spouses is required by tenants by entirety. It also provides that when one spouse passes away the surviving spouse gains full ownership of the property.


   Understanding Tenants by Entirety (TBE)  

For example, a husband could not decide to sell his ownership interest in a vacation home owned with his wife without the wife's consent.



About half of the U.S. states allow tenancy by entirety for all types of property; a handful of states allow it only for real estate. Other possible structures under which spouses may choose to jointly own property include tenancy in common and joint tenancy. Each method of holding title affects each owner's rights to transfer the property and use it as collateral. The ownership structure also determines what will happen to the property when one spouse dies and whether the property can be used to satisfy a debt or judgment.


   How Tenants by Entirety Are Viewed From a Legal Perspective  

Property that is held by tenants by entirety is comparable to community property. Both spouses mutually own the entire property as a whole rather than any type of subdivision, where each would have individual ownership. One key distinction, however, relates to a creditor's ability to attach property in order to collect on a debt. Tenants by entirety precludes creditor's from attaching the property of an individual debtor. Only in cases where both the husband and wife are parties to the debt can the property be attached. This is not the case with community property. Regardless of who owes the debt, community property can be attached. In addition, federal tax liens against one spouse could in some circumstances be attached to property that is covered by tenants by entirety and potentially subject to seizure



The rights of tenants by entirety can supersede the terms laid out in a will or trust that might otherwise grant property to heirs upon the death of one of the spouses. For example, the will left by a deceased party might state they want one of their surviving children to take possession of a piece of property. If that property is jointly owned by the decedent's spouse and falls under the terms of tenants by entirety, the terms of the will may be ignored. The surviving spouse would retain sole ownership of the property.



A tenancy by entirety can be eliminated under such circumstances as a divorce, which would see the property divided between the parties, or a voluntary, mutually-sought petition by both parties to change the nature of ownership.
What Is a Tender?  

The term tender refers to an invitation to bid for a project. Tendering usually refers to the process whereby governments and financial institutions invite bids for large projects that must be submitted within a finite deadline. The word tender can also refer to the acceptance of a formal offer, such as a takeover bid. This form of tendering is the process whereby shareholders submit their shares or securities in response to a takeover offer.

   How a Tender Works  

As noted above, a tender is a term used in business to refer to an invitation by governments and other entities to submit a bid for contracts. Most institutions have a well-defined tender process for projects or procurements. There are also specific processes in place to govern the opening, evaluation, and final selection of the vendors. This ensures that the selection process is fair and transparent.



A request for tender is a formal and structured invitation to suppliers to submit competitive bids to supply raw materials, products, or services. Because this is a public and open process, laws were created to govern the process to ensure fair competition among bidders.



For example, without laws, bribery and nepotism may flourish. Tender services are available for potential bidders and include a wide range of tenders from private and public sources. These services include crafting suitable bids, coordinating the process to ensure deadlines are met, and ensuring compliance with applicable laws.






In the private sector, requests for tenders are referred to as requests for proposals (RFPs). This allows potential bidders to respond to the defined needs of the issuer.


   Tender vs. Tender Offer  

Don't confuse the term tender with a tender offer, which most people often do. The latter is a public solicitation to all shareholders requesting that they tender their stock for sale at a specific price during a certain time. To entice shareholders to release a specific number of shares, the offer typically exceeds the current market value of the shares. In the U.S., tender offers are highly scrutinized and subject to extensive regulation.



For example, on Dec. 13, 2021, Dell (DELL) announced it closed a tender offer to repurchase shares of the company's securities. To fund the stock buyback, the company used cash on hand along with the net proceeds from the sale of $2.25 billion of senior notes.



Since the deal targets shareholders directly, it effectively removes upper management from the process, unless those members of management are also substantial shareholders. If an acquiring company already has a notable share of the target company (which is referred to as a foothold block), a minority of the remaining shareholders may be enough to allow the offering company to become the majority shareholder.



If the requested shares are not released by the deadline, the deal is often considered void. If this happens, it effectively allows shareholders to block the deal.


   Competitive Tender vs. Non-Competitive Tender  

The terms competitive tender and non-competitive tender refer to two different methods governments use to sell government securities. In the United States, the government sells Treasury securities, such as bonds, bills, and notes, to help fund the government's operations. Individual investors, commercial banks, corporations, pension funds, brokers, and dealers are some of the typical buyers of government securities. In exchange for investing in these securities, buyers will receive the government's promise of full repayment at maturity along with a specified interest payment.



There are two ways that investors can purchase government securities—through a competitive tender and a non-competitive tender. A competitive tender is a bidding process in which large institutional investors buy newly issued government securities. These institutional investors compete with one another to purchase the securities in an auction. The investor that bids the highest will win the auction and can purchase the security at the bid price.



Smaller, non-institutional investors purchase government securities through a non-competitive tender process. The price for these securities is set by the large institutional investors during the competitive tender. For example, when the U.S. Treasury auctions securities to large institutional investors, it will use the winning bid to establish the fair market value (FMV) for its securities. It will then use this value to set the price that smaller investors will pay during the non-competitive tender.






The U.S. Treasury issues bonds in a term of 20 years or 30 years and pays a fixed interest rate every six months until they mature.


   Examples of Tender  

In the U.S., many business owners look to expand their businesses by becoming government contractors with federal, state, or local governments. They sell services or goods to governments and a variety of agencies. Federal agencies that routinely buy from contractors include the Defense Contract Management Agency, Department of Energy, Department of Education, Department of Health and Human Services, and Department of Homeland Security.



Becoming a contractor requires businesses to compete with one another by presenting proposals and quotes based on the requirements outlined by the government or agency in their invitation to tender. This process is also referred to as a call for bids. The U.S. federal government lists contract opportunities in a searchable database that helps business owners match open opportunities with the products or services they offer. The database also lists pre-solicitation notices, solicitation notices, and award notices.




What Does Tender Mean in Business and Finance?
Tender can have a couple of different meanings in business in finance. The most common definition of the word is the invitation to bid for a project—usually a large bid from contractors for projects by governments and financial institutions. It may also refer to the acceptance of a formal offer, which can include a takeover bid. In this case, shareholders put up their shares to the offering entity.




What Are Some Examples of Tendering?
Some of the most common examples of tendering include the submission process by contractors to various levels of government. For instance, private companies compete with one another to become government contractors. The process involves submitting proposals with costs based on the work required. Government agencies that typically put out calls for proposals are the Department of Energy, Department of Health and Human Services, and Department of Homeland Security.




What Are the Steps to Take in the Tender Process?
The tender process steps generally include the call for submissions, the bid submission, the selection process, and the formation of the contract. Once these steps are all complete, the contractor starts the project and sees it through completion.




What's the Difference Between Tender and Tender Offer?
People often confuse the terms tender and tender offer. Tender (or tendering) is mainly defined as the invitation to submit a bid for a project. Governments and other entities normally put out calls for contractors to submit proposals for projects that need to be done. They review these proposals and choose the best one for the job.A tender offer, on the other hand, is made by a public company or third party to purchase a shares from another company's shareholders. The bidder is the party conducting the tender offer.


   The Bottom Line  

Tender is an often-used term in business, finance, and investing that can have various meanings. In a business setting, tender refers to the process where governments invite vendors to bid for the right to work on government projects or provide goods or other services.



When purchasing government securities—such as U.S. Treasury bills, bonds, and notes—a tender has a different meaning. It refers to the bidding process in which investors purchase these securities. In a stock buyback, a tender offer refers to a corporation's solicitation to repurchase its stock from shareholders. Other uses of the term include short tender and hedged tender.
What Is a Tender Offer?  

A tender offer is a bid to purchase some or all of shareholders' stock in a corporation. Tender offers are typically made publicly and invite shareholders to sell their shares for a specified price and within a particular window of time. The price offered is usually at a premium to the market price and is often contingent upon a minimum or a maximum number of shares sold.



To tender is to invite bids for a project or accept a formal offer such as a takeover bid. An exchange offer is a specialized type of tender offer in which securities or other non-cash alternatives are offered in exchange for shares.





Key Takeaways

A tender offer is a public solicitation to all shareholders requesting that they tender their stock for sale at a specific price during a certain time.The tender offer typically is set at a higher price per share than the company’s current stock price, providing shareholders a greater incentive to sell their shares.In the case of a takeover attempt, the tender may be conditional on the prospective buyer being able to obtain a certain amount of shares, such as a sufficient number of shares to constitute a controlling interest in the company.






   How a Tender Offer Works  

A tender offer often occurs when an investor proposes buying shares from every shareholder of a publicly traded company for a certain price at a certain time. The investor normally offers a higher price per share than the company’s stock price, providing shareholders a greater incentive to sell their shares.



Most tender offers are made at a specified price that represents a significant premium over the current share price. A tender offer might, for instance, be made to purchase outstanding stock shares for $18 a share when the current market price is only $15 a share. The reason for offering the premium is to induce a large number of shareholders to sell their shares. In the case of a takeover attempt, the tender may be conditional on the prospective buyer being able to obtain a certain amount of shares, such as a sufficient number of shares to constitute a controlling interest in the company.



A publicly traded company issues a tender offer with the intent to buy back its own outstanding securities. Sometimes, a privately or publicly traded company executes a tender offer directly to shareholders without the board of directors' (BOD) consent, resulting in a hostile takeover. Acquirers include hedge funds, private equity firms, management-led investor groups, and other companies.



The day after the announcement, a target company’s shares usually trade below or at a discount to the offer price, which is attributed to the uncertainty of and time needed for the offer. As the closing date nears and issues are resolved, the spread typically narrows.



Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) laws require any corporation or individual acquiring 5% or more of a company to disclose their stake to the SEC, the target company, and the exchange.





Important

The shares of stock purchased in a tender offer become the property of the purchaser. From that point forward, the purchaser, like any other shareholder, has the right to hold or sell the shares at their discretion.


   Example of a Tender Offer  

For example, Company A has a current stock price of $10 per share. An investor, seeking to gain control of the corporation, submits a tender offer of $12 per share with the condition that they acquire at least 51% of the shares. In corporate finance, a tender offer is often called a takeover bid as the investor seeks to take over control of the corporation.


   Advantages of a Tender Offer  

Tender offers provide several advantages to investors. For example, investors are not obligated to buy shares until a set number is tendered, which eliminates large upfront cash outlays and prevents investors from liquidating stock positions if offers fail. Acquirers can also include escape clauses, releasing liability for buying shares. For example, if the government rejects a proposed acquisition citing antitrust violations, the acquirer can refuse to buy tendered shares.



In many instances, investors gain control of target companies in less than one month if shareholders accept their offers; they also generally earn more than normal investments in the stock market.


   Disadvantages of a Tender Offer  

Although tender offers provide many benefits, there are some noted disadvantages. A tender offer is an expensive way to complete a hostile takeover as investors pay SEC filing fees, attorney costs, and other fees for specialized services. It can be a time-consuming process as depository banks verify tendered shares and issue payments on behalf of the investor. Also, if other investors become involved in a hostile takeover, the offer price increases, and because there are no guarantees, the investor may lose money on the deal.
What Is a Tenkan-Sen (Conversion Line)?  

Tenkan-Sen, or Conversion Line, is the mid-point of the highest and lowest prices of an asset over the last nine periods. The Tenkan-Sen is part of a larger indicator called the Ichimoku Kinko Hyo, which shows potential support and resistance areas based on different timeframes. Ichimoku Kinko Hyo roughly means "one look equilibrium chart," and is commonly called the Ichimoku Cloud indicator.



The Ichimoku Cloud indicator was developed by Japanese journalist Goichi Hosoda and promoted to the public in 1969. The Ichimoku combines a typical candlestick chart with five additional lines that measure price movement and volatility. One of those lines is the Tenkan-Sen.





Key Takeaways

The Tenkan-Sen is the fastest moving line that appears in the Ichimoku Cloud indicator.The line follows price closely, therefore it helps highlight short-term price direction via its slope.Tenkan-Sen is its own line/indicator, but its value is also used in the Senkou Span A (Leading Span A) formula.Senkou Span A is one of the two lines that form the "cloud" or "kumo" for the Ichimoku Cloud indicator.

   How to Calculate the Tenkan-Sen (Conversion Line)  

Find the highest price in the last nine periods.Find the lowest price in the last nine periods.Add these values together and then divide by two.Repeat the process as each period ends.


   Understanding the Tenkan-Sen (Conversion Line)  

The Tenkan-Sen shows an asset's short-term price momentum. On its own, it shows the mid-point price over the last nine periods. Due to the very short-term nature of the indicator, it is not typically used on its own but rather used in conjunction with the other elements of the Ichimoku Cloud indicator.



For example, if the Tenkan-Sen moves above the Kijun-Sen (Base Line), which is the 26-period price midpoint, some traders view that as a buy signal. Conversely, if the Tenkan-Sen drops below the Kijun-Sen, it may be viewed as a sell signal.















TradingView.



These signals are also filtered via the "cloud," a colored part of the indicator that is used to help identify the trend. When the price is above the cloud the trend is up, and when the price is below the cloud the trend is down. If the price is moving within the cloud, that often indicates choppy trading, or that the trend is in the process of reversing.



Therefore, when the price is above the cloud, traders may prefer to buy when the Tenkan-Sen crosses above the Kijun-Sen. They may also sell that long position when it crosses back below.



In a downtrend, when the price is below the cloud, traders may short-sell when the Tenkan-Sen crosses below the Kijun-Sen. They may cover the short position when the Tenkan-Sen crosses back above the Kijun-Sen.



The Tenkan-Sen also plays a role in generating Senkou Span A, one of two lines creating the "cloud" on the Ichimoku indicator. The edges of the cloud indicate support and resistance points, and the thickness of the cloud indicates price volatility. As indicated above, the cloud also helps identify the trend.


   The Tenkan-Sen (Conversion Line) vs. a Simple Moving Average (SMA)  

The Tenkan-Sen is sometimes wrongly confused with a simple moving average (SMA). The Tenkan-Sen is a mid-point, calculated by adding the nine-period high and low and dividing by two. This is a different calculation than a SMA, which would add up the closing prices from the nine periods and then divide the total by nine.


   Limitations of Using the Tenkan-Sen (Conversion Line)  

The Tenkan-Sen moves closely with the price, so it doesn't provide a lot of information on its own, except possibly to very short-term traders. Because of this, the Tenkan-Sen is typically used in conjunction with other lines in the Ichimoku indicator.



Crossover trade signals are sometimes used between the Tenkan-Sen and the Kijun-Sen. While these crossover trade signals may produce high-profit trades, the strategy is also prone to whipsaws. This is when crossovers occur but the price fails to move as anticipated, resulting in more crossovers and losing trades.



The Tenkan-Sen is the mid-point price of the last nine periods. There is nothing inherently predictive in its calculation. Therefore, while it may provide some insight and trade signals, traders are well advised to also incorporate other forms of analysis, such as price action and other indicators, into their strategy, as opposed to relying exclusively on the Ichimoku indicator and its elements.
What Is Tenor?  

Tenor refers to the length of time remaining before a financial contract expires. It is sometimes used interchangeably with the term maturity, although the terms have distinct meanings. Tenor is used in relation to bank loans, insurance contracts, and derivative products.





Key Takeaways

The term tenor describes the length of time remaining in the life of a financial contract.By contrast, maturity refers to the initial length of a contract upon its inception.Higher-tenor contracts are sometimes considered riskier, and vice versa.Tenor is particularly important in a credit default swap because it coordinates the term remaining on the contract with the maturity of the underlying asset.Understanding the tenor of a financial contract is crucial to analyze the contract's riskiness and maintain a steady cash flow. 


   Understanding Tenor  

Tenor is often used in relation to bank loans and insurance contracts, whereas the term maturity is more often used when describing government bonds and corporate bonds. Colloquially, the two terms have very similar meanings, and they may be used interchangeably for different types of financial instruments.



The term tenor is also used in relation to non-standard financial instruments, such as derivative contracts. In this context, it is often used when describing the riskiness of a particular security.



For instance, a futures contract with a long tenor could be said to be relatively risky because there is still significant time in which its value might fall. Derivatives with shorter tenors would likewise be viewed as less risky. As compensation for this perceived risk, buyers of high-tenor securities will generally require compensation in the form of lower prices or higher risk premiums.



Depending on their risk tolerance and financial objectives, some investors may even systematically avoid securities with tenors longer than the specified period. For instance, a company wishing to manage its short and medium-term liquidity needs might buy and sell debt instruments with tenors of five years or less. In this context, adjustments might be made based on the perceived creditworthiness of the counterparties involved. For instance, a company might accept a five-year tenor for counterparties with high credit ratings, while limiting poorly-rated counterparties to tenors of three years or less.


   Tenor vs. Maturity  

From a technical perspective, tenor and maturity have distinct meanings. Whereas tenor refers to the length of time remaining in a contract, maturity refers to the initial length of the agreement upon its inception.



For example, if a 10-year government bond was issued five years ago, then its maturity would be ten years and its tenor—the time remaining until the end of the contract—would be five years. In this manner, the tenor of a financial instrument declines over time, whereas its maturity remains constant.


   Example of Tenor  

Alex is the chief financial officer (CFO) of a mid-size publicly traded corporation. As part of their portfolio of responsibilities, they must ensure that the company has adequate working capital to carry out its operations.



To that end, Alex buys and sells short and medium-term financial instruments with tenors ranging between one and five years. They do so in the corporate bond market as well as through over-the-counter derivative transactions with various counterparties.



Currently, Alex's portfolio includes several instruments from highly creditworthy counterparties with maturities of five years. Because they were purchased three years ago, these securities have tenors of two years. Their portfolio also includes instruments from counterparties with weaker credit ratings. For these instruments, they limit their maximum tenor to three years, in order to manage their counterparty risk.


   Special Considerations  

Tenor is particularly important in a credit default swap because it coordinates the term remaining on the contract with the maturity of the underlying asset. A properly structured credit default swap must match the maturity between contract and asset. If there is a mismatch between the tenor and the asset's maturity, then integration is not likely. Furthermore, coordination between cash flows (and subsequent calculation of yield) is only possible when tenor and asset maturity are linked.


   Tenor FAQs  
  What Does Tenor Mean?  

Tenor refers to the length of time remaining before a financial contract expires. It is often used interchangeably with the term "maturity."


  What Is Tenor in Banking?  

Tenor, in regards to banking, refers to the length of time that will be taken by the borrower to repay the loan along with the interest. Generally, a home loan tenure may be from 5–20 years with some banks allowing up to 25 years


  What Is Maximum Tenor?  

The loan tenor is typically between 5 and 25 years, with a maximum of 30 years, depending on the type of project and its debt servicing capability. 


  What Is Tenor Basis Risk?  

Tenor basis risk is the risk that arises when a basis swap occurs. Despite re-pricing on the same date, being in the same currency, and being linked to the same benchmark, problems could arise when they re-price if they do so for different periods or tenors.


   The Bottom Line  

Understanding the tenor of any financial instruments a company may hold, such as a short- or long-term derivative, is crucial to maintaining a steady cash flow and analyzing a contract's riskiness.
What Is a Term Deposit?  

A term deposit is a fixed-term investment that includes the deposit of money into an account at a financial institution. Term deposit investments usually carry short-term maturities ranging from one month to a few years and will have varying levels of required minimum deposits.



The investor must understand when buying a term deposit that they can withdraw their funds only after the term ends. In some cases, the account holder may allow the investor early termination—or withdrawal—if they give several days notification. Also, there will be a penalty assessed for early termination.



Examples of term deposits include certificates of deposit (CDs) and time deposits.





Key Takeaways

A term deposit is a type of deposit account held at a financial institution where money is locked up for some set period of time.Term deposits are usually short-term deposits with maturities ranging from one month to a few years.Typically, term deposits offer higher interest rates than traditional liquid savings accounts, whereby customers can withdraw their money at any time.

   Term Deposit Explained  

When an account holder deposits funds at a bank, the bank can use that money to lend to other consumers or businesses. In return for the right to use these funds for lending, they will pay the depositor compensation in the form of interest on the account balance. With most deposit accounts of this nature, the owner may withdraw their money at any time. This makes it difficult for the bank to know ahead of time how much they may lend at any given time.



To overcome this problem, banks offer term deposit accounts. A customer will deposit or invest in one of these accounts, agreeing not to withdraw their funds for a fixed period in return for a higher rate of interest paid on the account.



The interest earned on a term deposit account is slightly higher than that paid on standard savings or interest-bearing checking accounts. The increased rate is because access to the money is limited for the timeframe of the term deposit.



Term deposits are an extremely safe investment and are therefore very appealing to conservative, low-risk investors. The financial instruments are sold by banks, thrift institutions, and credit unions. Term deposits sold by banks are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) provides coverage for those sold by credit unions.


   How a Bank Uses a Term Deposit  

If a customer places money in a term deposit, the bank can invest the money in other financial products that pay a higher rate of return (RoR) than what the bank is paying the customer for the use of their funds. The bank can also lend the money out to its other clients, thereby receiving a higher interest rate from the borrowers as compared to what the bank is paying in interest for the term deposit.



For example, a lender may offer a 2% rate for term deposits with a two-year maturity. The funds deposited are then structured as loans to borrowers who are charged 7% in interest on those notes. This difference in rates means that the bank makes a net 5% return. The spread between the rate the bank pays its customers for deposits and the rate it charges its borrowers is called net interest margin. Net interest margin is a profitability metric for banks.



Banks are businesses, as such, they want to pay the lowest rate possible for term deposits and charge a much higher rate to borrowers for loans. This practice increases their margins or profitability. However, there is a balance the bank needs to maintain. If it pays too little interest, it won't attract new investors into the term deposit accounts. Also, if they charge too high of a rate on loans, it won't attract new borrowers.


   Term Deposits and Interest Rates  

In periods of rising interest rates, consumers are more likely to purchase term deposits since the increased cost of borrowing makes savings more attractive. Also, with higher market interest rates, the financial institution will need to offer the investor a higher rate of interest, so the investor also earns more.



When interest rates decrease, consumers are encouraged to borrow and spend more, thereby stimulating the economy. In a low interest rate environment, demand for term deposits can decrease since investors can typically find alternative investment vehicles that pay a higher rate.



Typically, interest rates should be proportional to the time until maturity, and the minimum amount of principal lent to the credit union or bank. In other words, a six-month term deposit will likely pay a lower interest rate than a two-year term deposit. Investors not only receive a higher rate for locking up their money with the bank for extended periods, but also should earn a higher rate for large deposits. For example, a jumbo CD, which is a term deposit above $100,000, will receive a higher interest rate than a $1,000 CD.


   Opening or Closing a Term Deposit  

Term deposits are also called certificates of deposits. Customers can view the conditions of the term deposit via a paper statement. This statement includes the required minimum principal amount, the interest rate paid, and the duration (or time to maturity), as agreed by the bank and the depositor. 



If a customer wants to close a term deposit before the end of the term, or maturity, the customer will be subject to a penalty. This penalty may include the loss of any interest paid on the deposit account until that point. Closing the CD before the term ends lets the customer take back the principal amount invested but with the forfeiture of the earned interest.



The penalty for withdrawing prematurely or against the agreement is stated at the time of opening a term deposit, as required by the Truth in Savings Act.



Sometimes, if interest rates have risen considerably, it might be worth it for a customer to close the term deposit early, take the penalty for the early withdrawal, and reinvest the funds elsewhere at a higher rate. It's important to be sure that the alternative rate is high enough to more than compensate for the original rate on the term deposit plus the cost of the penalty.



When a term deposit is nearing its maturity date, the bank holding the deposit will usually send a letter notifying the customer of the upcoming maturity. In the letter, the bank will ask if the customer wants the deposit renewed again for the same length to maturity. The rollover will likely be at a different rate based on the market interest rate at that time. Alternatively, the customer has the option of placing the funds in another financial product.






Investors holding retirement CDs should speak to a financial planner or tax advisor who can explain the different regulations involved in early withdrawal from these investments.


   Inflation and Term Deposits  

Unfortunately, term deposits do not keep up with inflation. The inflation rate is a measure of how much prices rise in a given year. If the rate on a term deposit is 2% and the inflation rate in the U.S. is 2.5%, theoretically, the customer is not earning enough to compensate for price increases in the economy.


   Laddering Strategy  

Rather than investing a large lump sum into one term deposit, an investor may use a strategy that spreads out the funds between several CDs. This strategy for investing using term deposits is to distribute an investment evenly over a set number of years with maturities coming at regular intervals. This laddering investment strategy locks in the interest rates with the CDs at longer terms having higher rates than those with shorter terms. As the CDs mature, the customer can choose to use the money for income by withdrawing the funds or roll those funds into another CD to continue the ladder. The method allows the investor to have access to funds as they mature.



For example, an investor can deposit $3,000 each into a five, four, three, two, and one-year term deposit. One of the CDs matures each year, which allows the customer to either withdraw the money for expenses or roll the funds into a new account. The new term deposit will have a rate based on the current market rate. This method is popular for retirees who need to withdraw a set amount of income each year from their savings to pay for living expenses.



The strategy can be used while investing with the same credit union or bank, or across several different institutions. The investor can either withdraw the principal and interest upon maturity or reinvest the funds if they are not needed.





Pros

Term deposits offer a fixed rate of interest over the life of the investment.
Term deposits are risk-free, safe investments since they're either backed by the FDIC or the NCUA.
Various maturities allow investors to stagger end-dates to create an investment ladder.
Term deposits have a low minimum deposit amount.
Term deposits pay higher rates for larger initial deposit amounts.



Cons

Interest rates paid on term deposits are typically lower or less attractive than most fixed-rate investments.
Term deposits can't be withdrawn early without penalty or losing all of the interest earned.
Interest rates don't keep up with rising inflation.
Interest rate risk exists if investors are locked in a low-rate term deposit while overall interest rates are rising.





   Example of Term Deposits  

Wells Fargo Bank (WFC) is one of the largest consumer banks in the U.S. and offers several types of term deposits. Below are a few of the bank's CDs along with the interest rates paid to depositors as of Mar. 19, 2022:



A six-month CD with a minimum $2,500 deposit pays 0.01%.A one-year CD with a minimum $2,500 deposit pays 0.01%.



Please note that the interest rates being offered by the bank can change anytime for new CDs and might be different depending on the state in which the branch is located.
What Is Term Life Insurance?  

Term life insurance provides a death benefit that pays the beneficiaries of the policyholder throughout a specified period of time.



Once the term expires, the policyholder can either renew it for another term, possibly convert the policy to permanent coverage, or allow the term life insurance policy to lapse.





Key Takeaways

Term life insurance guarantees payment of a stated death benefit to the insured's beneficiaries if the insured person dies during the specified term.These policies have no value other than the guaranteed death benefit and don’t feature a savings component (as is found in permanent life insurance products).Term life premiums are based on a person’s age, health, and life expectancy.Depending on the insurance company, it may be possible to turn term life into whole life insurance.You can purchase term life policies that last 10, 15, 20 years, or more, and can usually renew them for an additional term.

   How Term Life Insurance Works  

When you buy a term life insurance policy, the insurance company determines the premium based on the policy's value (the payout amount) and  such factors as your age, gender, and health. Other considerations affecting rates include the company’s business expenses, how much it earns from its investments, and mortality rates for each age. 



In some cases, a medical exam may be required. The insurance company may also inquire about your driving record, current medications, smoking status, occupation, hobbies, family history, and similar information.



If you die during the policy term, the insurer will pay the policy's face value to your beneficiaries. This cash benefit—which is not typically taxable—may be used by beneficiaries to settle your healthcare and funeral costs, consumer debt, mortgage debt, and other expenses. However, beneficiaries are not required to use the insurance proceeds to settle the deceased's debts.



If the policy expires before your death or you live beyond the policy term, there is no payout. You may be able to renew a term policy at expiration, but the premiums will be recalculated based on your age at the time of renewal.


  Cost of Term Life Insurance  

Term life is usually the least costly life insurance available because it offers a death benefit for a restricted time and doesn’t have a cash value component like permanent insurance has. For example, data from Insureon shows that a healthy non-smoking man aged 30 could get a 30-year term life insurance policy with a $500,000 death benefit for an average of $30 per month as of February 2023. At age 50, the premium would rise to $138 a month.

Most term life insurance policies expire without paying a death benefit. That lowers the overall risk to the insurer compared to a permanent life policy. The reduced risk is one factor that allows insurers to charge lower premiums.



Interest rates, the financials of the insurance company, and state regulations can also affect premiums. In general, companies often offer better rates at the "breakpoint" coverage levels of $100,000, $250,000, $500,000, and $1,000,000.






When you consider the amount of coverage you can get for your premium dollars, term life insurance tends to be the least expensive life insurance. Check our recommendations for the best term life insurance policies when you are ready to buy.


   Example of Term Life Insurance  

Thirty-year-old George wants to protect his family in the unlikely event of his early death. He buys a 10-year, $500,000 term life insurance policy with a premium of $50 per month.



If George dies within the 10-year term, the policy will pay George’s beneficiary $500,000. If he dies after the policy has expired, his beneficiary will receive no benefit. If he remains alive and renews the policy after 10 years, the premiums will be higher than his initial policy because they will be based on his current age of 40 rather than 30.



If George is diagnosed with a terminal illness during the first policy term, he probably will not be eligible to renew the policy when it expires. Some policies do offer guaranteed re-insurability (without proof of insurability), but such features come with a higher cost.


   Types of Term Life Insurance  

There are several types of term life insurance. The best option will depend on your individual circumstances. Generally, most companies offer terms ranging from 10 to 30 years, although a few offer 35- and 40-year terms.


  Level Term or Level-Premium Policy  

Level-premium insurance has a fixed monthly payment for the life of the policy. Most term life insurance has a level premium, and it’s the type we’ve been referring to in most of this article. As we mentioned before, this type of policy generally provides coverage for a period ranging from 10 to 30 years. The death benefit is also fixed.



Because actuaries must account for the increasing costs of insurance over the life of the policy's effectiveness, the level premium is comparatively higher than yearly renewable term life insurance.


  Yearly Renewable Term (YRT) Policy  

Yearly renewable term (YRT) policies are one-year policies that can be renewed each year without providing evidence of insurability.



The premiums rise from year to year as the insured person ages. Thus, the premiums can become prohibitively expensive as the policyholder ages. But they may be a good option for someone who needs temporary insurance.


  Decreasing Term Policy  

These policies have a death benefit that declines each year according to a predetermined schedule. The policyholder pays a fixed, level premium for the duration of the policy.



Decreasing term policies are often used in concert with a mortgage, with the policyholder matching the payout of the insurance to the declining principal of the home loan.


   Benefits of Term Life Insurance  

Term life insurance is attractive to young people with children. Parents can obtain substantial coverage for a low cost, and if the insured dies while the policy is in effect, the family can rely on the death benefit to replace lost income.



These policies are also well-suited for people with growing families. They can maintain coverage needed until, for example, their children reach adulthood and become self-sufficient.



The term life benefit may be equally useful to an older surviving spouse. However, premiums for people who wait until they are older to apply for insurance will pay higher premiums than if they’d gotten a level-term policy when they were younger. 



Each insurance company sets a maximum age for their term life insurance coverage. This usually ranges from about 80 to 90 years old. 


   Term Life Insurance vs. Permanent Life Insurance  

The main differences between a term life insurance policy and a permanent insurance policy (such as whole life or universal life insurance) are the duration of the policy, the accumulation of a cash value, and the cost. The right choice for you will depend on your needs. Here are some things to consider.


  Cost of Premiums  

Term life policies are ideal for people who want substantial coverage at a low cost.



People who own whole life insurance pay more in premiums for less coverage but have the security of knowing they are protected for life.



People who buy term life pay premiums for an extended period, but they get nothing in return unless they have the misfortune to die before the term expires. Plus, term life insurance premiums increase with age.


  Availability of Coverage  

Unless a term policy is a is guaranteed renewable, the company could refuse to renew coverage at the end of a policy's term if the policyholder develops a severe illness. Permanent insurance provides coverage for life as long as the premiums are paid, regardless of changes in the insured’s health.


  Investment Value  

Some customers prefer permanent life insurance because the policies typically contain an investment or savings vehicle. A portion of each premium payment is allocated to the cash value, which usually grows while the policy remains in force. Some plans pay dividends, which can be paid out in cash or left on deposit within the policy.



Over time, the cash value may grow large enough to pay the premiums on the policy. There are also several unique tax benefits, such as tax-deferred cash value growth and tax-free access to the cash portion.



But financial advisors warn that the growth rate of a policy with cash value is often paltry compared to other financial instruments, such as mutual funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Also, substantial administrative fees often cut into the rate of return. This is the source of  the phrase, “buy term and invest the difference.” However, the performance of permanent insurance can be steady and it is tax-advantaged, providing additional benefits when the stock market is volatile.


  Other Factors  

There is no one-size-fits-all answer to the term versus permanent insurance debate. Other factors to consider include: 



Is the rate of return earned on investments sufficiently attractive?
Does the permanent policy have a loan provision and other features so you can access the cash value during your lifetime?
Does the policyholder have or intend to have a business that requires insurance coverage?
Will life insurance play a role in tax-sheltering a sizable estate?


   Term Life Insurance vs. Convertible Term Life Insurance  

Convertible term life insurance is a term life policy that includes a conversion rider. The rider guarantees the right to convert an in-force term policy—or one about to expire—to a permanent plan without going through underwriting or proving insurability. The conversion rider should allow you to convert to any permanent policy the insurance company offers with no restrictions.



The primary features of the rider are maintaining the original health rating of the term policy upon conversion (even if you later have health issues or become uninsurable) and deciding when and how much of the coverage to convert. The basis for the premium of the new permanent policy is your age at conversion.



Of course, overall premiums will increase significantly since whole life insurance is more expensive than term life insurance. The advantage is the guaranteed approval without a medical exam. Medical conditions that develop during the term life period cannot cause premiums to be increased. However, the company may require limited or full underwriting if you want to add additional riders to the new policy, such as a long-term care rider.




Which Is Better: Term Life Insurance or Whole Life Insurance?
It depends on your family's needs. Term life insurance is a relatively inexpensive way to provide a lump sum to your dependents if something happens to you. If you are young and healthy, and you support a family, it can be a good option. Whole life insurance comes with substantially higher monthly premiums. It is meant to provide coverage for as long as you live. As the coverage matures, the policy grows in value and the policyholder can make withdrawals for any purpose. Thus, it can serve as an investment product as well as an insurance policy.




Do You Get Your Money Back at the End of a Term Life Insurance Policy?
If you're alive when the term expires, you get nothing back from your term life insurance policy. The death benefit is only payable to your beneficiaries if you die. That is the reason why term life insurance is relatively inexpensive. Most people outlive their term life insurance policies.




Can a Senior Citizen Get Term Life Insurance?
It depends on their age. Insurance companies seta maximum age limit for term life insurance policies. This is usually 80 to 90 years old, but may be higher or lower depending on the company. The premium also rises with age, so a person aged 60 or 70 will pay substantially more than someone decades younger.


   The Bottom Line  

Term life insurance is a good option for people who can't or won't pay the much higher monthly premiums associated with whole life insurance.



Term life is somewhat similar to car insurance. It's statistically unlikely that you'll need it, and the premiums are money down the drain if you don't. But if the worst happens, your family will receive the benefits.
What Is a Term Loan?  

A term loan provides borrowers with a lump sum of cash upfront in exchange for specific borrowing terms. Term loans are normally meant for established small businesses with sound financial statements. In exchange for a specified amount of cash, the borrower agrees to a certain repayment schedule with a fixed or floating interest rate. Term loans may require substantial down payments to reduce the payment amounts and the total cost of the loan.





Key Takeaways

A term loan provides borrowers with a lump sum of cash upfront in exchange for specific borrowing terms.Borrowers agree to pay their lenders a fixed amount over a certain repayment schedule with either a fixed or floating interest rate.Term loans are commonly used by small businesses to purchase fixed assets, such as equipment or a new building.Borrowers prefer term loans because they offer more flexibility and lower interest rates.Short and intermediate-term loans may require balloon payments while long-term facilities come with fixed payments.


   Understanding Term Loans  

Term loans are commonly granted to small businesses that need cash to purchase equipment, a new building for their production processes, or any other fixed assets to keep their businesses going. Some businesses borrow the cash they need to operate on a month-to-month basis. Many banks have established term loan programs specifically to help companies in this way.



Business owners apply for term loans the same way they would any other credit facility—by approaching their lender. They must provide statements and other financial evidence demonstrating their creditworthiness. Approved borrowers get a lump sum of cash and are required to make payments over a certain period of time, usually on a monthly or quarterly repayment schedule. 



Term loans carry a fixed or variable interest rate and a set maturity date. If the proceeds are used to finance the purchase of an asset, the useful life of that asset can impact the repayment schedule. The loan requires collateral and a rigorous approval process to reduce the risk of default or failure to make payments. As noted above, some lenders may require down payments before they advance the loan.



Borrowers often choose term loans for several reasons, including:



Simple application processReceiving an upfront lump sum of cashSpecified paymentsLower interest rates



Taking out a term loan also frees up cash from a company's cash flow in order to use it elsewhere.






Variable-rate term loans are based on a benchmark rate like the U.S. prime rate or the London InterBank Offered Rate (LIBOR).


   Types of Term Loans  

Term loans come in several varieties, usually reflecting the lifespan of the loan. These include:



Short-term loans: These types of term loans are usually offered to firms that don't qualify for a line of credit. They generally run less than a year, though they can also refer to a loan of up to 18 months.
Intermediate-term loans: These loans generally run between one to three years and are paid in monthly installments from a company’s cash flow.
Long-term loans: These loans last anywhere between three to 25 years. They use company assets as collateral and require monthly or quarterly payments from profits or cash flow. They limit other financial commitments the company may take on, including other debts, dividends, or principals' salaries, and can require an amount of profit set aside specifically for loan repayment.



Both short- and intermediate-term loans may also be balloon loans and come with balloon payments. This means the final installment swells or balloons into a much larger amount than any of the previous ones.






While the principal of a term loan is not technically due until maturity, most term loans operate on a specified schedule requiring a specific payment size at certain intervals.


   Example of a Term Loan  

A Small Business Administration (SBA) loan, officially known as a 7(a) guaranteed loan, encourages long-term financing. Short-term loans and revolving credit lines are also available to help with a company’s immediate and cyclical working capital needs.



Maturities for long-term loans vary according to the ability to repay, the purpose of the loan, and the useful life of the financed asset. Maximum maturity dates are generally 25 years for real estate, up to ten years for working capital, and ten years for most other loans. The borrower repays the loan with monthly principal and interest payments.



As with any loan, an SBA fixed-rate loan payment remains the same because the interest rate is constant. Conversely, a variable-rate loan's payment amount can vary since the interest rate fluctuates. A lender may establish an SBA loan with interest-only payments during a company's startup or expansion phase. As a result, the business has time to generate income before making full loan payments. Most SBA loans do not allow balloon payments.



The SBA charges the borrower a prepayment fee only if the loan has a maturity of 15 years or longer. Business and personal assets secure every loan until the recovery value equals the loan amount or until the borrower has pledged all assets as reasonably available.




Why Do Businesses Get Term Loans?
A term loan is usually meant for equipment, real estate, or working capital paid off between one and 25 years. A small business often uses the cash from a term loan to purchase fixed assets, such as equipment or a new building for its production process. Some businesses borrow the cash they need to operate from month to month. Many banks have established term-loan programs specifically to help companies in this way.




What Are the Types of Term Loans?
Term loans come in several varieties, usually reflecting the lifespan of the loan. A short-term loan, usually offered to firms that don't qualify for a line of credit, generally runs less than a year, though it can also refer to a loan of up to 18 months or so. An intermediate-term loan generally runs more than one to three years and is paid in monthly installments from a company’s cash flow. A long-term loan runs for three to 25 years, uses company assets as collateral, and requires monthly or quarterly payments from profits or cash flow.




What Are the Common Attributes of Term Loans?
Term loans carry a fixed or variable interest rate, a monthly or quarterly repayment schedule, and a set maturity date. If the loan is used to finance an asset purchase, the useful life of that asset can impact the repayment schedule. The loan requires collateral and a rigorous approval process to reduce the risk of default or failure to make payments. However, term loans generally carry no penalties if they are paid off ahead of schedule.

A term sheet is a nonbinding agreement that shows the basic terms and conditions of an investment. The term sheet serves as a template and basis for more detailed, legally binding documents. Once the parties involved reach an agreement on the details laid out in the term sheet, a binding agreement or contract that conforms to the term sheet details is drawn up.





Key Takeaways

A term sheet is a nonbinding agreement outlining the basic terms and conditions under which an investment will be made.Term sheets are most often associated with start-ups. Entrepreneurs find that this document is crucial to attracting investors, such as venture capitalists (VC) with capital to fund enterprises.The company valuation, investment amount, percentage stake, voting rights, liquidation preference, anti-dilutive provisions, and investor commitment are some items that should be spelled out in the term sheet.Term sheets are also used for mergers, acquisitions, and long-term debt (i.e. commercial real estate development). Term sheets are non-binding, though may often require an upfront good faith deposit or other indicator of evidence that both parties intend to carry out an executed full agreement. 


   Uses of a Term Sheet  

The term sheet should cover the significant aspects of a deal without detailing every minor contingency covered by a binding contract. The term sheet essentially lays the groundwork for ensuring that the parties involved in a business transaction agree on most major aspects. The term sheet reduces the likelihood of a misunderstanding or unnecessary dispute. Additionally, the term sheet ensures that expensive legal charges involved in drawing up a binding agreement or contract are not incurred prematurely.



All term sheets contain information on the assets, initial purchase price including any contingencies that may affect the price, a timeframe for a response, and other salient information.



Term sheets are most often associated with startups. Entrepreneurs find this document crucial for investors, often venture capitalists (VC), who may offer capital to fund startups.



A term sheet used as part of a merger or attempted acquisition would typically contain information regarding the initial purchase price offer, the preferred payment method, and the assets included in the deal. The term sheet may also contain information regarding what, if anything, is excluded from the deal or any items that may be considered requirements by one or both parties.


   What's Included in a Term Sheet  

The details to be included in a term sheet are highly dependent on the agreement at hand. What is included in a angel investment, early funding investment term sheet will be substantially different than what's included in a commercial real estate development term sheet.



Regarding an investment term sheet, commonly included details are:



Nonbinding Terms. Neither party is legally obligated to abide by whatever is outlined on the term sheet.
Company valuations, investment amounts, the percentage of stakes, and anti-dilutive provisions should be spelled out clearly.
Voting rights. Startups seeking funding are usually at the mercy of VCs who want to maximize their investment return. This can result in the investor asking for and obtaining a disproportionate influence on the company's direction.
Liquidation preference. The term sheet should state how the proceeds of a sale will be distributed between the entrepreneur and the investors.
Investor commitment. The term sheet should state how long the investor is required to remain vested.



Regarding debt agreements, commonly included details are:



Economic details. This includes the term, loan size, interest rate, and other financial matters common to debt.
Risk mitigation preferences. The lender will often require specific conditions be met or specific information be provided on a recurring, timely manner. 
Extension rights. The borrower is often allowed to extend a loan, but the term sheet identifies the conditions and cost of extension.
Due diligence at closing. As part of the term sheet, the lender may stipulate what they require when the loan agreement is drafted. This can include a list of requirements the borrower must prepare to be approved for the loan. 






A term sheet may be signed by both parties to formally signify that each side has agreed to the terms and that each team's legal council may proceed with drafting a formal agreement.


   Terms Found in a Term Sheet  

Term sheets often have standardized language that is commonly and widely accepted by both parties. Here are some specific terms or phrases found in two different types of term sheets.


  Investment Term Sheets  

Valuation (Pre-Money & Post-Money): Investors may want to see the pre-money valuation and post-money valuation before an official investment agreement is drafted. This valuation information should be based on what the valuation is before the investment is made as well as the value of the company including the new investment.



Valuation Cap: The valuation cap is the value when convertible notes become eligible to covert into equity. Often an important negotiation point, this figure must be discussed early between the two parties to understand a fair point for the start-up to engage in a proper valuation and what protection is fair for the investor.



Drag Alone Clause: Investors may want guarantees that minority stakeholders will follow the guidance of majority stakeholders. A drag along clause requires that smaller investors lead larger investors in business decisions.



Dividends: Investors may want upfront clarity on what net income distributions they will be entitled to. In addition to clarifying the dollar amounts, investors may want to know the timing (i.e. monthly, quarterly, or annual).



Liquidation Preference: Investors may want to know the order in which owners are paid out in the event the company gets sold. This is important to investors as it reduces investment risk.



Voting Rights; Investors may be interested in the say they have over the operations of the company. This may be an agreement on the number of votes the investor receives or any restrictions on matters in which they are not eligible to vote in.



Pro-Rata Rights: Investors may want to better understand their rights for future rounds of investing. For example, depending on their current investment, they may be entitled to the right of first offer for an investment offering in the future. On the other hand, there may be penalties for investors that decide to not partake in future rounds of investing.



No-Shop Agreement: Investors may want protection from other investors or other investment rounds. A no-shop agreement outlines the terms that restrict the company from taking investment money from other people for a specific period of time.


  Loan Term Sheet  

Loan Amount: Borrowers are obviously pursuing a specific amount of funds to borrow. This term may be a fixed dollar amount, subject to LTV metrics, or subject to DSCR and NOI calculations.



Guaranty: Borrowers may be required to indicate what legal entity with more established credit may vouch for the debt and be held liable in the event that the direct company defaults.



Interest Rate: Depending on the loan, these terms may widely vary. For long-term loans, the interest rate may include a fixed spread rate in addition to a variable rate (i.e. one-month term SOFR).



Term: Borrowers must understand when the loan is fully payable or due. For open lines of credit or development loans, this is the period in which the loan is assessed interest but principal payments may not be due.



Collateral: Borrowers may have to post collateral to substantiate value in the event that they default on a loan. This is often the underlying asset that is supported by the debt, and the lender often stipulates whether they require having the first deed of trust.



Financial Covenants: Borrowers may have to substantiate financial health to a lender. This includes providing externally certified financial statements, guarantee statements, or other financial records that are in accordance with covenants agreed to with the lender.



Loan Costs: In addition to interest assessments, a lender may require an annual administration fee or a one-time loan closing fee. For very large loans, these expenses may be material, and the lender should take care in reviewing what upfront costs must be paid before any loan proceeds are distributed.


   Tips for Writing a Term Sheet  

Every term sheet will vary, as the parties, conditions, situation, and agreement will rarely be repeated. Still, there are broad tips to drafting a term sheet that apply to nearly every situation:



Summarize the Conditions. At the beginning of the term sheet, draft a summary that identifies the overall purpose of the agreement and intended outcome. This includes specifically addressing the project (i.e. Seed A funding of Company XYZ or Residential Development of 254 units in Los Angeles, CA). Identify each of the legal parties to be involved. 
State Binding/Non-Binding Terms. A term sheet should explicitly state expectations regarding whether the agreement is binding or non-binding. This is often listed early in the term sheet. 
List the Terms. Though straightforward, understand that a term sheet is the first piece of formal transparent information the opposing party may receive. Though the term sheet should not be the full list of details in the agreement, be mindful to provide enough information to entice the other party without being too overwhelming with details. The term sheet should cover the primary, most important aspects of a deal with the understanding that the minor aspects can be sorted out later. 
State Timeframes. Though the term sheet is non-binding, it should still come with an expiration date that requires the opposing party to take action by a certain time. This will not only encourage participation and action on the term letter but also ensure the terms of the deal do not become stale and unfavorable if held open for too long. 
Encourage Feedback. Consider distributing a Word document version of the term sheet that tracks changes. It would be ideal if the first draft of the term sheet was a complete meeting of the minds with no further changes. Realistically, this is rarely achieved. Though you must ensure the other party does not make changes without tracking, tracking changes allows each side to easily identify the areas not yet in agreement.






A company will often solicit multiple term sheets and compare the terms across bidders. It will then likely move forward with the term sheet that is most favorable, though it may decide to negotiate with anyone that submit a term sheet.


   Similar Documents to Term Sheets  

A term sheet may seem similar to a letter of intent (LOI) when the action is predominately one-sided, as in acquisitions, or a working document to serve as a jumping-off point for more intensive negotiations. The main difference between an LOI and a term sheet is stylistic; the former is written as a formal letter while the latter is composed of bullet points outlining the terms.



Although term sheets are distinct from LOI and memorandums of understanding (MOU), the three documents are often referred to interchangeably because they accomplish similar goals and contain similar information.


   Example of a Term Sheet  

In 2021, the New York City Department of Housing Preservation & Development released a term sheet regarding its Supportive Housing Loan Program. The program was intended to offer low-interest loans to support the development of supporting houses with on-site social services.















NYC Supportive Housing Loan Program Term Sheet.
NYC Department of Housing Preservation and Development



The term sheet outlines what entities are eligible for these low-interest loans, what tenants quality for the on-site social services requirement, the loan amount, loan terms, as well as construction requirements. At the end of the term sheet, the department's contact information is shown so interested parties that agree to these terms can communicate with the NYC Office of Development.




What Are the Key Points of a Term Sheet?
A term sheet often covers four main categories: the deal economics, the investor rights, the governance and oversight, and the exit terms. A term sheet must communicate enough terms to be insightful for the investor without being a complete set of terms that still need to be negotiated




Who Prepares a Term Sheet?
Depending on the financial instrument, different parties may be the one to prepare the term sheet. For seed round investments, investors often provide a term sheet when offering their private investment. For loans, lending institution will often provide a term sheet to prospective borrowers.




Is a Term Sheet Legally Binding?
Term sheets evidence serious intent but are generally not legally binding. A company may sign a term sheet to agree to the terms of the instrument. However, for example, a separate loan agreement must be signed to be legally binding; a company is not under contract for the loan even if it agrees to a term sheet.




What Is a Term Sheet Format?
A term sheet may take many different forms. In general, it must outline the economic transaction agreed to by the parties. These transactions may range from mergers, acquisitions, loans, joint ventures, or commercial real estate transactions. The format of each term sheet must be tailored to each specific type of instrument.


   The Bottom Line  

A term sheet is a document that evidences serious intent between two parties that often signals the beginning of a transaction. This term sheet is the first step for the two parties to begin agreeing to how the deal will be structured. Though term sheets are often not binding, they may require a good faith deposit to be held in escrow that indicates expectation of a future deal to be agreed upon.
What Is the Term Structure Of Interest Rates?  

The term structure of interest rates, commonly known as the yield curve, depicts the interest rates of similar quality bonds at different maturities.





Key Takeaways

The term structure of interest rates, commonly known as the yield curve, depicts the interest rates of similar quality bonds at different maturities.The term structure of interest rates reflects expectations of market participants about future changes in interest rates and their assessment of monetary policy conditions.One commonly used yield curve compares the three-month, two-year, five-year, 10-year, and 30-year U.S. Treasury debt.

   Understanding Term Structure Of Interest Rates  

Essentially, term structure of interest rates is the relationship between interest rates or bond yields and different terms or maturities. When graphed, the term structure of interest rates is known as a yield curve, and it plays a crucial role in identifying the current state of an economy. The term structure of interest rates reflects the expectations of market participants about future changes in interest rates and their assessment of monetary policy conditions.



In general terms, yields increase in line with maturity, giving rise to an upward-sloping, or normal, yield curve. The yield curve is primarily used to illustrate the term structure of interest rates for standard U.S. government-issued securities. This is important as it is a gauge of the debt market's feeling about risk. One commonly used yield curve compares the three-month, two-year, five-year, 10-year, and 30-year U.S. Treasury debt. (Yield curve rates are usually available at the Treasury's interest rate website by 6:00 p.m. Eastern Standard Time each trading day).



The term of the structure of interest rates has three primary shapes.



Upward sloping—long-term yields are higher than short-term yields. This is considered to be the "normal" slope of the yield curve and signals that the economy is in an expansionary mode.
Downward sloping—short-term yields are higher than long-term yields. Dubbed as an "inverted" yield curve and signifies that the economy is in, or about to enter, a recessive period.
Flat—very little variation between short and long-term yields. This signals that the market is unsure about the future direction of the economy.


   The U.S. Treasury Yield Curve  

The U.S. Treasury yield curve is considered to be the benchmark for the credit market because it reports the yields of risk-free fixed income investments across a range of maturities. In the credit market, banks and lenders use this benchmark as a gauge for determining lending and savings rates. Yields along the U.S. Treasury yield curve are primarily influenced by the Federal Reserve’s federal funds rate. Other yield curves can also be developed based upon a comparison of credit investments with similar risk characteristics.



Most often, the Treasury yield curve is upward-sloping. One basic explanation for this phenomenon is that investors demand higher interest rates for longer-term investments as compensation for investing their money in longer-duration investments. Occasionally, long-term yields may fall below short-term yields, creating an inverted yield curve that is generally regarded as a harbinger of recession.


   The Outlook for the Overall Credit Market  

The term structure of interest rates and the direction of the yield curve can be used to judge the overall credit market environment. A flattening of the yield curve means longer-term rates are falling in comparison to short-term rates, which could have implications for a recession. When short-term rates begin to exceed long-term rates, the yield curve is inverted, and a recession is likely occurring or approaching.



When longer-term rates fall below shorter-term rates, the outlook for credit over the long term is weak. This is often consistent with a weak or recessionary economy. While other factors, including foreign demand for U.S. Treasuries, can also result in an inverted yield curve, historically, an inverted yield curve has been an indicator of an impending recession in the United States.
What Is Term to Maturity?  

A bond's term to maturity is the length of time during which the owner will receive interest payments on the investment. When the bond reaches maturity the principal is repaid.





Key Takeaways

A bond's term to maturity is the period during which its owner will receive interest payments on the investment.When the bond reaches maturity, the owner is repaid its par, or face, value.The term to maturity can change if the bond has a put or call option.



Bonds can be grouped into three broad categories depending on their terms to maturity: short-term bonds of one to three years, intermediate-term bonds of four to 10 years, and long-term bonds of 10 to 30 years.


   Understanding Term to Maturity  

Generally, the longer the term to maturity is, the higher the interest rate on the bond will be and the less volatile its price will be on the secondary bond market. Also, the further a bond is from its maturity date, the larger the difference between its purchase price and its redemption value, which is also referred to as its principal, par, or face value.


  Interest Rate Risk  

The interest rate on long-term bonds is higher to compensate for the interest rate risk the investor is taking on. The investor is locking in money for the long run, with the risk of missing out on a better return if interest rates go higher. The investor will be forced to forego the higher return or sell the bond at a loss in order to reinvest the money at a higher rate.






The term to maturity is one factor in the interest rate paid on a bond. The longer the term, the higher the return.



A short-term bond pays relatively less interest but the investor gains flexibility. The money will be repaid in a year or less and can be invested at a new, higher, rate of return.



In the secondary market, a bond's value is based on its remaining yield to maturity as well as its face, or par, value.


  Why Term to Maturity Can Change  

For many bonds, the term to maturity is fixed. However, the term to maturity can be changed if the bond has a call provision, a put provision, or a conversion provision:



A call provision allows a company to pay off a bond before its term of maturity ends. A company might do this if interest rates decline, making it advantageous to pay off the old bonds and issue a new one at a lower rate of return.A put provision allows the owner to sell the bond back to the company at its face value. An investor might do this to recoup the money for another investment.A conversion provision allows the owner of a bond to convert it into shares of stock in the company.


   An Example of Term to Maturity  

The Walt Disney Company raised $7 billion by selling bonds in September 2019.



The company issued new bonds with six terms of maturity in short-term, medium-term, and long-term versions. The long-term version was a 30-year bond that pays 0.95% more than the comparable Treasury bonds.
What Is the Terminal Capitalization Rate?  

The terminal capitalization rate, also known as the exit rate, is the rate used to estimate the resale value of a property at the end of the holding period. The expected net operating income (NOI) per year is divided by the terminal cap rate (expressed as a percentage) to get the terminal value.



Terminal capitalization rates are estimated based on comparable transaction data or what is believed to be appropriate for a particular property's location and attributes.





Key Takeaways

The terminal capitalization rate, or exit rate, is used to estimate the resale value of a property at the end of the holding period.The going-in cap rate is the property's projected first-year NOI divided by the purchase price of the property.If the terminal capitalization rate is lower than the going-in rate, it usually means that the property investment was profitable.


   Understanding the Terminal Capitalization Rate  

The going-in cap rate is the projected first-year NOI divided by the initial investment or purchase price. In contrast, the terminal capitalization rate is the projected NOI of the last year (exit year) divided by the sale price. If this rate is lower than the going-in cap rate, it usually means that the property investment was profitable.



Most real estate investing professionals agree that it's important to match the terminal capitalization rate to the current rate of the market, keeping in mind that it may be a safer test for the development to nudge the terminal cap rate up a bit. A dynamic spreadsheet can be useful to stress test the development project to establish the highest terminal capitalization rate that would still provide a sufficient upside to investors.



Savvy real estate investors look for markets and property types for which market capitalization rates are expected to fall since a lower terminal capitalization rate, compared to the going-in cap rate, will result in capital gains, assuming that the NOI will not decrease over the holding period. Some of the data that must be considered includes supply-and-demand metrics for each category of space, as well as for the services and expenses assumed to be related to each area of operation.






While the future is always uncertain, two things are certain about the end of any holding period: the buildings will age and the markets will change. It's thus critical that all real estate investors compile and analyze as much data as possible to accurately pinpoint a terminal capitalization rate for a project.


   Example of the Terminal Capitalization Rate  

An investor buys a fully occupied property for $100 million. First-year NOI is estimated at $5.0 million. The going-in cap rate is therefore 5.0%.



Seven years later, the investor believes that the terminal capitalization rate is approximately 4.0%. Last year NOI, which has taken into account rent escalation along the way, is projected at $5.5 million (again, assuming full occupancy).



The resale value is estimated at $137.5 million ($5.5 million in NOI divided by the 4.0% terminal capitalization, or exit, rate).
What Is Terminal Value (TV)?  

Terminal value (TV) is the value of an asset, business, or project beyond the forecasted period when future cash flows can be estimated. Terminal value assumes a business will grow at a set growth rate forever after the forecast period. Terminal value often comprises a large percentage of the total assessed value.





Key Takeaways

Terminal value (TV) determines a company's value into perpetuity beyond a set forecast period—usually three to five years.Analysts use the discounted cash flow model (DCF) to calculate the total value of a business. The forecast period and terminal value are both integral components of DCF.The two most common methods for calculating terminal value are perpetual growth (Gordon Growth Model) and exit multiple.The perpetual growth method assumes that a business will generate cash flows at a constant rate forever, while the exit multiple method assumes that a business will be sold.












Investopedia / Theresa Chiechi


   Understanding Terminal Value  

Forecasting gets murkier as the time horizon grows longer. This holds true in finance as well, especially when it comes to estimating a company's cash flows well into the future. At the same time, businesses need to be valued. To "solve" this, analysts use financial models, such as discounted cash flow (DCF), along with certain assumptions to derive the total value of a business or project.



Discounted cash flow (DCF) is a popular method used in feasibility studies, corporate acquisitions, and stock market valuation. This method is based on the theory that an asset's value is equal to all future cash flows derived from that asset. These cash flows must be discounted to the present value at a discount rate representing the cost of capital, such as the interest rate.



DCF has two major components: forecast period and terminal value. The forecast period is usually about three to five years. Anything longer than that and the accuracy of the projections suffer. This is where calculating terminal value becomes important. However, for certain industries like those involved in natural resource extraction, this period is often longer.



There are two commonly used methods to calculate terminal value: perpetual growth (Gordon Growth Model) and exit multiple. The former assumes that a business will continue to generate cash flows at a constant rate forever while the latter assumes that a business will be sold for a multiple of some market metric. Investment professionals prefer the exit multiple approach while academics favor the perpetual growth model.






The Gordon Growth Model is named after Myron Gordon, an economist at the University of Toronto, who worked out the basic formula in the late 1950s.


   Types of Terminal Value  
  Perpetuity Method  

Discounting is necessary because the time value of money creates a discrepancy between the current and future values of a given sum of money. In business valuation, free cash flow or dividends can be forecast for a discrete period of time, but the performance of ongoing concerns becomes more challenging to estimate as the projections stretch further into the future. Moreover, it is difficult to determine the precise time when a company may cease operations.



To overcome these limitations, investors can assume that cash flows will grow at a stable rate forever, starting at some point in the future. This represents the terminal value. 



Terminal value is calculated by dividing the last cash flow forecast by the difference between the discount rate and terminal growth rate. The terminal value calculation estimates the value of the company after the forecast period.



The formula to calculate terminal value is:



[FCF x (1 + g)] / (d – g)



Where:



FCF = free cash flow for the last forecast period 
g = terminal growth rate 
d = discount rate (which is usually the weighted average cost of capital)



The terminal growth rate is the constant rate that a company is expected to grow at forever. This growth rate starts at the end of the last forecasted cash flow period in a discounted cash flow model and goes into perpetuity. A terminal growth rate is usually in line with the long-term rate of inflation, but not higher than the historical gross domestic product (GDP) growth rate.  


  Exit Multiple Method  

If investors assume a finite window of operations, there is no need to use the perpetuity growth model. Instead, the terminal value must reflect the net realizable value of a company's assets at that time. This often implies that the equity will be acquired by a larger firm, and the value of acquisitions are often calculated with exit multiples.



Exit multiples estimate a fair price by multiplying financial statistics, such as sales, profits, or earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) by a factor that is common for similar firms that were recently acquired. The terminal value formula using the exit multiple method is the most recent metric (i.e., sales, EBITDA, etc.) multiplied by the decided upon multiple (usually an average of recent exit multiples for other transactions). Investment banks often employ this valuation method, but some detractors hesitate to use intrinsic and relative valuation techniques simultaneously.






Terminal value accounts for a significant portion of the total value of a business in a DCF model, as it represents the value of all future cash flows beyond the projection period. This means that the assumptions made about terminal value can have a significant impact on the overall valuation of a business.




Why Do We Need to Know the Terminal Value of a Business or Asset?
Most companies do not assume they will stop operations after a few years. They expect business will continue forever (or at least a very long time). Terminal value is an attempt to anticipate a company's future value and apply it to present prices through discounting.




How Is Terminal Value Estimated?
There are several terminal value formulas. Like discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis, most terminal value formulas project future cash flows to return the present value of a future asset. The liquidation value model (or exit method) requires figuring the asset's earning power with an appropriate discount rate, then adjusting for the estimated value of outstanding debt.The stable (perpetuity) growth model does not assume the company will be liquidated after the terminal year. Instead, it assumes that cash flows are reinvested and that the firm can grow at a constant rate into perpetuity. The multiples approach uses the approximate sales revenues of a company during the last year of a discounted cash flow model, then uses a multiple of that figure to arrive at the terminal value without further discounting applied.




When Evaluating Terminal Value, Should I Use the Perpetuity Growth Model or the Exit Approach?
In DCF analysis, neither the perpetuity growth model nor the exit multiple approach is likely to render a perfectly accurate estimate of terminal value. The choice of which method of calculating terminal value to use depends partly on whether an investor wishes to obtain a relatively more optimistic estimate or a relatively more conservative estimate.Generally speaking, using the perpetuity growth model to estimate terminal value renders a higher value. Investors can benefit from using both terminal value calculations and then using an average of the two values arrived at for a final estimate of NPV.




What Does a Negative Terminal Value Mean?
A negative terminal value would be estimated if the cost of future capital exceeded the assumed growth rate. In practice, however, negative terminal valuations cannot exist for very long. A company's equity value can only realistically fall to zero at a minimum, and any remaining liabilities would be sorted out in a bankruptcy proceeding. Whenever an investor comes across a firm with negative net earnings relative to its cost of capital, it's probably best to rely on other fundamental tools outside of terminal valuation.




Is Terminal Value the Same as NPV?
No, terminal value is not the same as net present value (NPV). Terminal value is a financial concept used in discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis and depreciation to account for the value of an asset at the end of its useful life or of a business past some projection period.On the other hand, net present value (NPV) is a measure of the profitability of an investment or project. It is calculated by discounting all future cash flows of the investment or project to the present value using a discount rate, and then subtracting the initial investment. NPV is used to determine whether an investment or project is expected to generate positive returns or losses. It is a commonly used tool in financial decision making, as it helps to evaluate the attractiveness of an investment or project by considering the time value of money.


   The Bottom Line  

Terminal value is the estimated value of an asset at the end of its useful life. It is used for computing depreciation and is also a crucial part of DCF analysis as it accounts for a significant portion of the total value of a business.  Terminal value can be calculated using two methods: the perpetual growth method or the exit multiple method. Terminal value is a crucial part of DCF analysis as it accounts for a significant portion of the total value of a business. It is important to carefully consider the assumptions made when calculating terminal value as they can have a significant impact on the overall valuation of a business.
What Is Termination of Employment?  

The term termination of employment refers to the end of an employee’s work with a company. An employee may be terminated from a job of their own free will or following a decision made by the employer. Employers who execute a termination of employment may do so for a number of reasons, including downsizing, poor job performance, or redundancies.



An employee who is not actively working because of an illness, leave of absence, or furlough is still considered employed if the relationship with the employer has not been terminated formally with a notice of termination.





Key Takeaways

Termination of employment refers to the end of an employee’s work with a company.Termination may be voluntary, as when a worker leaves of their own accord.Involuntary termination occurs when a company downsizes, makes layoffs, or fires an employee.Severance packages are discretionary, which means a company does not need to offer them to employees when their employment is terminated.A worker who is unemployed through no fault of their own may be eligible to receive unemployment benefits.


   How Voluntary Termination Works  

An employee may voluntarily terminate their employment with a company at any time. An individual usually does so when they find a better job with another company, retire from the labor force, resign to start their own business, or when they want to take a break from working.



Voluntary termination may also be a result of constructive dismissal, which is also called constructive discharge or constructive dismissal. This means that the employee leaves the company because they had no other choice. They could have been working under significant duress and difficult working conditions, which could include a low salary, harassment, a new work location that is farther than the employee can reasonably commute, and increased work hours, among other reasons.



The forced discharge of an employee, whereby they are given an ultimatum to quit or be fired, also falls under constructive dismissal. If the employee can prove that the employer’s actions were unlawful during their tenure, they may be entitled to some form of compensation or benefits.



An employee who voluntarily leaves an employer may be required to hand in their resignation, which is an advanced notice, either verbally or in writing. Most industries usually require a two-week notice of an employee's termination. In some cases, the employee gives notice at the time that they terminate, or they give no notice at all, such as when an employee abandons the job or fails to return to work.






If your employment changes due to a change in hours, lay off, or termination, you may qualify for COBRA health insurance coverage under your existing group health plan for 18 months. If you choose to continue under the same plan, you are responsible for the full premium each month.


   How Involuntary Termination Works  

Involuntary termination of employment occurs when an employer lays off, dismisses, or fires an employee.


  Layoffs and Downsizing  

In a layoff, employees are usually let go through no fault of their own, unlike workers who are fired. Companies often decide to lay off workers or downsize their organizations to lower their operating costs, restructure their organizations, or because they no longer need an employee’s skill set. Layoffs may require employers to suspend certain roles temporarily, as was the case during the COVID-19 pandemic, or they may be permanent as a result of restructuring decisions.


  Getting Fired  

An employee is usually fired from a job as a result of unsatisfactory work performance, bad behavior, or a poor attitude that does not fit with the corporation’s culture. They may also be let go because of unethical conduct that violates the company’s policies.



According to at-will employment laws recognized in some states, a company may dismiss without warning any employee who is performing poorly or violating some form of the company’s rules. In fact, the company does not need to give a reason for the employee's termination.


  Illegal Dismissals  

Although employment-at-will contracts do not require an employer to warn or give a reason for a dismissal, an employer cannot fire a worker for certain reasons, including:



Refusing to work more than the hours specified in the contract
Taking a leave of absence
Reporting an incident or a person to the Human Resources (HR) department
Whistleblows to industry regulators



Individuals cannot be fired for these reasons. An employer who discharges an employee for exercising their legal rights does so unlawfully and may be liable for wrongful termination in the courts.



Other illegal dismissals occur when an employer lets an employee go for discriminatory reasons such as religion, race, age, gender, disability, sexual preference, or nationality. An employer who is found guilty of wrongful termination may be required to compensate the wronged employee and/or reinstate them into the company.


  Termination for Cause  

Other than at-will conditions of employment, an employer may fire an employee for a specific cause. A termination-for-cause clause requires the employer to put the employee on an improvement schedule of 60 or 90 days, during which the employee is expected to improve their work ethic. If the employee does not improve by the end of the probationary period, they could be terminated for cause and dismissed with prejudice.



In some cases, an employer may dismiss an employee without prejudice. This indicates that the employee was let go for reasons other than incompetence, insubordination, or misconduct in the workplace. In such situations, the employee may be rehired for a similar job in the future.


  Termination Compensation  

Some employers may provide employees with a notice of termination and pay, which is often called severance pay. This is common for employees who have worked with a company for more than three months and are involuntarily terminated. A company that offers severance does so following an agreement made privately with the employee or because severance is specified in its employee handbook. Keep in mind, though severance packages aren't a requirement under the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA).



Employers are not required by federal law to give the terminated employee a final paycheck immediately. However, state laws differ and may mandate that the employer must not only immediately provide the affected employee with a final paycheck, but also include accrued and unused vacation days.



Anyone who is unemployed through no fault of their own may be eligible to receive unemployment benefits. Each state administers an unemployment insurance (UI) program to offer temporary financial assistance to people who are unemployed and looking for a job. The U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) provides detailed information about unemployment insurance benefits.






The last day with your employer is commonly referred to as your end, separation, or termination date.




Is Getting Terminated the Same as Getting Fired?
You are terminated from your employment if you are fired. The reason for your termination depends and your employer should let you know why they let you go. You may be fired for misconduct, poor performance, or because you're not a good fit for the position or company.




What Are the Main Reasons For Getting Fired?
Employers may fire their employees for misconduct, poor job performance, violating company policy(s), theft, damage to company property or the use of company materials for personal matters, insubordination, too many sick days without justification, or consistent lateness.Some employers may build moral clauses into their employment contracts, which hold employees to a certain standard in and outside the workplace. As such, social media activity that goes against these standards may be reason enough to fire an employee.




What Is Wrongful Termination?
Wrongful termination occurs when an employee is let go for reasons prohibited by employment law, such as discrimination, whistleblowing, or retaliation.Employers who fire individuals for not complying with certain requests, such as doing dangerous or illegal work, are also guilty of wrongful termination. Companies that change working conditions without notice, ultimately forcing an employee to leave or be fired, are also said to be in violation of employment laws.Individuals who are wrongfully terminated may pursue legal action against their former employers.




How Do You Fight Termination of Employment?
You may not be able to fight termination of employment if you were let go for a legitimate reason, such as restructuring or theft of company property. But if you believe you were terminated without just cause, there are some steps you can take.Make sure you understand why you're being terminated. If you can, appeal the decision with your employer or the company's human resources department. Request copies of documents, including your employment contract, any communications between you and your employer regarding your performance, as well as your employment file. If you have a union, contact your representative. You can also consult an employment lawyer to take your case to court if you have a case.


   The Bottom Line  

There are many reasons why employees and employers end their relationship. Some employees may decide to leave their jobs voluntarily while others may be let go because of misconduct, poor performance, or another reason.



You have certain rights if you were terminated. For instance, you have the right to rescind your resignation if you choose to leave voluntarily. And you have the right to file an unemployment insurance claim if you lost your job through no fault of your own. You may have legal recourse if you believe that your employer retaliated against you and let you go illegally, whether that's because you took a leave of absence or because they discriminated against you. Be sure to check with an employment lawyer if any of these apply.
What Are Terms of Employment?  

Terms of employment refer to the responsibilities and benefits associated with a job as agreed upon by an employer and employee at the time of hiring. These terms, which may also be referred to as conditions of employment, generally include job responsibilities, work hours, dress code, time off the job, and starting salary. They may also include benefits such as health insurance, life insurance, and retirement plans.



Although terms of employment may be agreed upon verbally, employees and employers normally sign written contracts. But, if you are an at-will employee, your employer can change the terms of employment, including your salary, hours, and worksite, at any time.





Key Takeaways

Terms of employment are the benefits and responsibilities that an employee agrees to when they accept a job.Terms may include things like salary, benefits, retirement, company policies, termination, and non-compete agreements.Executives and workers with skills that are in demand generally have some bargaining power in their terms of employment.The minimum terms of employment are set by the U.S. Department of Labor.


   How Terms of Employment Work  

Most employers require professional and administrative employees, as well as executives to sign a written employment agreement or contract that details the terms of employment. The conditions of employment for hourly employees are often outlined in an employee handbook or company policy manual. In certain circumstances, terms may also be expressed verbally. Written terms, though, can protect both the employee and the employer.



In addition to the nuts and bolts of salary and benefits, terms of employment can specify touchy issues such as dispute resolution, nondisclosure or non-compete agreements, and grounds for termination, as well as the possibility of a notice of termination.



Job seekers with skills in high demand are often able to negotiate better terms of employment. Executive-level jobs also include negotiations over the terms between hiring managers and candidates. Whether it's an executive position or an entry-level job, terms of employment are subject to state or federal guidelines.



Minimum standards for terms of employment in the U.S. are set by the Department of Labor (DOL). They include rules covering the minimum wage, overtime, the standard workweek, mandated break times, and safety issues.﻿﻿ The department also governs employment laws in certain industries, such as agriculture, mining, and construction.﻿﻿ State laws may add additional benefits, rules, or rights regarding employment within their jurisdictions.﻿﻿






Make sure you read the entire employment contract offered by a prospective employer before you sign. If you're unsure, it's a good idea to have an attorney take a look at it.


   Special Considerations  

Employment contracts are normally considered at-will in the United States. This means that either the employer or employee can legally terminate the agreement at any time for almost any reason. At-will employment allows an employee to be fired even if no terms of employment have been violated. Employment laws protect workers from discrimination due to race, gender, or religion.



In practice, employees with contracts generally have a degree of job security for the length of the contract as long as they do not violate any contract conditions. At-will laws don't apply in Montana—the only state of its kind—so employees can only be terminated for good reason.



The at-will rule also doesn't apply to individuals who are part of labor unions. These organizations help protect workers' rights by negotiating benefits and other employment conditions, including terms of termination. Employees who work under unions have set contracts and can't be terminated at-will thanks to collective bargaining agreements.


   Terms of Employment Abroad  

Most developed and developing countries have codified certain standard terms of employment. Ireland has its Terms of Employment (Information) Act which outlines rules covering a variety of workplace and labor topics.﻿﻿ Australia's Fair Work Ombudsman sets rules related to pay, leave, redundancy, entitlements, and more.﻿﻿



U.S. labor laws are not generous compared to those in other parts of the world. The European Union, for example, mandates that workers get at least four weeks of vacation every year.﻿﻿ In Finland, expectant mothers get paid leave at least six weeks before their due date, and 15 more weeks after the birth of a child.﻿﻿ Benefits like these may not be included in your next terms of employment, no matter how hard you bargain.
What Are Terms of Trade (TOT)?  

Terms of trade (TOT) represent the ratio between a country's export prices and its import prices. TOT indexes are defined as the value of a country's total exports minus total imports. The ratio is calculated by dividing the price of the exports by the price of the imports and multiplying the result by 100.



When more capital is leaving the country than is entering the country then, the TOT will be less than 100%. When the TOT is greater than 100%, the country is accumulating more capital from exports than it is spending on imports.





Key Takeaways

Terms of trade (TOT) is a key economic metric of a company's health measured through what it imports and exports.TOT is expressed as a ratio that reflects the number of units of exports that are needed to buy a single unit of imports.TOT is determined by dividing the price of the exports by the price of the imports and multiplying the number by 100.A TOT over 100% or that shows improvement over time can be a positive economic indicator as it can mean that export prices have risen as import prices have held steady or declined.

   Understanding Terms of Trade (TOT)  

The TOT is used as an indicator of a country’s economic health, but it can lead analysts to draw the wrong conclusions. Changes in import prices and export prices impact the TOT, and it's important to understand what caused the price to increase or decrease. TOT measurements are often recorded in an index for economic monitoring purposes.



An improvement or increase in a country's TOT generally indicates that export prices have gone up as import prices have either maintained or dropped. Conversely, export prices might have dropped but not as significantly as import prices. Export prices might remain steady while import prices have decreased or they might have simply increased at a faster pace than import prices. All these scenarios can result in an improved TOT.


   Factors Affecting Terms of Trade  

A TOT is dependent to some extent on exchange and inflation rates and prices. A variety of other factors influence the TOT as well, and some are unique to specific sectors and industries.



Scarcity—the number of goods available for trade—is one such factor. The more goods a vendor has available for sale, the more goods it will likely sell, and the more goods that vendor can buy using capital obtained from sales.






The size and quality of goods also affect TOT. Larger and higher-quality goods will likely cost more. If goods sell for a higher price, a seller will have additional capital to purchase more goods.


   Fluctuating Terms of Trade  

A country can purchase more imported goods for every unit of export that it sells when its TOT improves. An increase in the TOT can thus be beneficial because the country needs fewer exports to buy a given number of imports.



It might also have a positive impact on domestic cost-push inflation when the TOT increases because the increase is indicative of falling import prices to export prices. The country’s export volumes could fall to the detriment of the balance of payments (BOP), however.



The country must export a greater number of units to purchase the same number of imports when its TOT deteriorates. The Prebisch-Singer hypothesis states that some emerging markets and developing countries have experienced declining TOTs because of a generalized decline in the price of commodities relative to the price of manufactured goods.


   TOT Example  

Developing countries experienced increases in their terms of trade during the commodity price boom in the early 2000s. They could buy more consumer goods from other countries when selling a certain quantity of commodities, such as oil and copper.



In the past two decades, however, a rise in globalization has reduced the price of manufactured goods. Industrialized countries' advantage over developing countries is becoming less significant.




How Do You Calculate a Country's Terms of Trade?
Terms of trade for a country can be calculated by dividing its price index of exports by its price index of imports. This ratio is then multiplied by 100:TOT = Pexports/Pimports x 100




What Does a Rising Terms of Trade Indicate?
An increasing TOT ratio indicates that a country is exporting relatively more goods than it is importing. Over time, this can lead to a trade surplus. The opposite would be true if TOT were decreasing.




How Can Terms of Trade Be Improved?
A rise in the domestic currency's exchange rate should improve terms of trade, as this makes imports relatively less expensive while boosting the prices of exports. Increasing the competitiveness of firms will also tend to boost TOT as they can compete better internationally. Inflation can also have a short-term benefit to TOT.
What Is the Tertiary Industry?  

The tertiary industry is a technical name for the services sector of the economy, which encompasses a wide range of businesses, including financial institutions, schools, hotels, and restaurants.



The tertiary industry is one of three primary industrial types in a developed economy, the other two being the primary (i.e., raw materials), and secondary (i.e., goods production) industries. As an economy becomes more developed, it tends to shift its focus from primary to secondary and tertiary industries.





Key Takeaways

The tertiary industry is the services sector of an economy, encompassing medical providers, educators, financial services, haircuts, and personal trainers, among many others.The tertiary sector can be subdivided broadly into for-profit and nonprofit segments.Economists have found that as a nation's economy grows and develops, the tertiary sector becomes larger while the primary sector that produces raw materials shrinks.The service sector is now the largest sector of the global economy in terms of value-added and is especially important in more advanced economies.


   Understanding the Tertiary Industry  

The tertiary industry is split into two main categories. The first is made up of companies in the business of making money, such as those in the financial industry. The second comprises the nonprofit segment, which includes services such as state education.



The tertiary industry sector makes up the vast majority of employment opportunities and is solely focused on providing services, not goods, to consumers and other organizations. For this reason, it is also known as the service sector.



This is in contrast to the primary industry, which produces raw materials, and the secondary industry, which takes raw materials and uses them to produce salable consumer goods.






The term tertiary industry can be used to describe a single service-oriented organization or the industry segment as a whole.


   Examples of Tertiary Industry Organizations  

The tertiary industry provides services, as well as operational frameworks for business operations. This can include organizations involved in the shipping and transportation industry, such as railroad or trucking, where the sole focus is on the process of moving goods. It could also include the transportation of people, such as taxi services, city bus systems, and subways.



Traditional hospitality industries, such as hotels and resorts, are a part of the tertiary industry, too, as are food service providers, such as restaurants. All services received from financial institutions, such as banks, and investment brokers, are tertiary in nature, as well.



Personal services, including everything from haircutting to tattooing, also fit into this category, along with services to animals, such as pet groomers, animal breeders, and stray animal care facilities. Hospitals, clinics, veterinarians, and other medical service facilities may qualify, too.


   Pricing Challenges in the Tertiary Industry  

Selling services can often be challenging compared to selling a specific product. Since goods are tangible, it’s easy to peg a price to them. Conversely, being intangible, it can be difficult to put a value on a specific service.



In these cases, the quality of service depends on the quality of the person providing it, and that can vary given people’s skills and personalities. For instance, when two different brokers provide seemingly identical services, how can a consumer choose between them?


   Transition From Tertiary to Quaternary  

Certain technological services were previously considered tertiary, though some have determined that it is appropriate to have them categorized into a new segment due to industry growth. These technological services include telecommunications providers, cable companies, and Internet providers.



Businesses in this sector are rapidly placing more focus on what is becoming known as the knowledge economy, or the ability to surpass competitors by understanding what target customers want and need, and operate in a way that meets those wants and needs quickly with minimal cost. Even though they are all service-oriented, like the tertiary sector, these services have been separated and classified into the quaternary industry sector.


   Who Has the Highest Output of Tertiary Services?  

According to the World Bank, the following countries are considered to be the largest by service or tertiary output as of 2020:



United States: $16.7 billionChina: $8.0 billionJapan: $3.6 billionGermany: $2.4 billionUnited Kingdom: $2.0 billionFrance: $1.9 billionIndia: $1.3 billionFrance: $1.4 billionItaly: $1.3 billionCanada: $1.1 billion
What Is a Testamentary Trust?  

A testamentary trust is a trust that is established in accordance with the instructions contained in a last will and testament. A trust is a fiduciary relationship that allows a trustee, who is a third party, to manage assets on behalf of the beneficiaries of the trust.



A person's will may include instructions to establish a testamentary trust so that the trustee can distribute the person's assets to the beneficiaries outlined in the will. However, a testamentary trust is not created until after the person has passed away. Also, a will could have more than one testamentary trust.



Testamentary trusts can be helpful as a part of an overall wealth management strategy since they provide instructions for distributing the assets within a decedent's estate. However, there are both advantages and disadvantages of testamentary trusts that should be considered before including one in a will.





Key Takeaways

A testamentary trust is a trust that is to contain a portion or all of a decedent's assets outlined within a person's last will and testament.A testamentary trust is not established until after the person passes away in which the executor settles the estate as outlined in the will.A testamentary trust can name minors as beneficiaries, in which the deceased's assets are paid out only when they reach a certain age.The trust can also be used to reduce estate tax liabilities and ensure professional management of the assets.A disadvantage of a testamentary trust is that it does not avoid probate—the legal process of distributing assets through the court.


   Understanding a Testamentary Trust  

A testamentary trust is created to manage the assets of the deceased on behalf of the beneficiaries. It is also used to reduce estate tax liabilities and ensure professional management of the assets of the deceased.



A testamentary trust doesn't exist until the person passes away, meaning the trust is essentially part of a set of instructions within a person's will to be drafted by a predetermined representative called an executor or executrix. The deceased's assets will be transferred into the newly created trust only after the person has passed away.



A testamentary trust can be established so that the deceased's assets are paid to the beneficiaries only when certain conditions have been met. For example, the language within the trust may state that the assets may be accessed by a child of the deceased for educational expenses until the child reaches the age of 25, at which time the balance will be paid out.



A testamentary trust might also be created to manage the charitable distribution of assets in accordance with the wishes of the deceased.


   Requirements for a Testamentary Trust  

A testamentary trust usually involves three parties: The grantor or trustor who creates the trust, the trustee who manages the assets held in trust, and the beneficiary or beneficiaries named in the will. A trustor has the option of setting up a testamentary trust, which will be established upon the death of the trustor.



The testamentary trust is a provision within the will that outlines the estate's executor and instructs that person to create the trust. However, the trust is not immediately established after the person's death since the will must go through the probate process. Probate is the legal process through a local court that verifies the authenticity of a will and the named executor or executrix.






A testamentary trust remains in effect until a triggering event is named in the will, such as a surviving child reaching the age of 21.



Once the probate process has been completed, the trust can be established and the executor transfers the property into the trust. The assigned trustee manages the assets until the trust expires and the beneficiary receives the assets.



The trust's expiration date is usually tied to a specific event, such as the beneficiary reaching a certain age or graduating from college. Until the trust expires, the probate court may check in periodically to ensure that the trust is managed properly.



The trustor can choose anyone to act as a trustee. However, the trustee appointed is not obligated to take on this role and may decline the request. If this happens, the court may appoint a trustee or a relative or friend of the beneficiaries involved may volunteer to act as the trustee.


   Testamentary Trust vs. Living Trust  

A testamentary trust is a trust that is to contain a portion or all of a decedent's assets outlined within a person's last will and testament. A testamentary trust is not established until after the person passes away in which the executor or executrix settles the estate as outlined in the will.



Conversely, a living trust is a trust that is established during the person's lifetime in which an appointed person—the trustee—is responsible for managing the person's assets for the benefit of the beneficiary or beneficiaries of the trust.



Although the instructions for a testamentary trust are outlined while the person is still living, the trust itself is not established until after the person passes away; only then can assets be distributed and placed into the trust. However, a living trust—also called an inter-vivos trust—allows for more involvement from the trustor since they're alive when the trust is established.



Also, a living trust can be revocable, meaning the trustor can change it. A living trust can also be irrevocable, meaning it cannot be changed once established. However, a testamentary trust cannot be revocable and is typically established as irrevocable since the trustor has passed away.


   Advantages and Disadvantages of a Testamentary Trust  

A testamentary trust has both advantages and disadvantages. Although a testamentary trust can be an effective estate planning tool, whether it's beneficial or not for a person's financial situation can depend on several factors.


  Advantages  

A testamentary trust can be helpful if the decedent, such as a parent, has young or minor children and want their assets distributed to them if they pass away prematurely. A parent's testamentary trust can be established with instructions that the funds would only be distributed to the beneficiaries following a specific milestone. For example, funds from the trust would not be distributed to a decedent's children until they turn 18 years of age.



Another advantage to a testamentary trust is that it can be modified while the person is still alive since the trust has not come into existence yet. In other words, a testamentary trust is essentially a revocable trust, since a will can be changed at any time before a person passes away.



In some cases, parents of young children might not have substantial financial assets, or perhaps a couple may not be able to afford the cost of establishing a living trust. Instead, they can create a testamentary trust within their will, which would only come into effect if they passed away.



Although there's still a cost to create a will, the cost of the testamentary trust would come out of the decedent's estate, avoiding the expense of creating a trust while still alive. If it turns out that later in life, they can afford to establish a trust, the testamentary trust instructions can be removed from the will, and a living trust can be established instead.


  Disadvantages  

A major disadvantage of a testamentary trust is that it does not avoid probate, which is the legal process of distributing assets through the court. In other words, the executor or executrix must go to the local court with the decedent's will and testament and other documents to prove that they have the right to distribute the decedent's assets and establish the testamentary trust.



The probate process is necessary to move the assets into the beneficiary's name, which can take several months to complete. Since the testamentary trust would not be established until after the person passes away and the probate process has begun, the beneficiaries of the decedent's assets may not receive their assets for several weeks or months.



Another disadvantage of a testamentary trust is that, since it must go through probate, it becomes a public record. As a result, the beneficiaries of the testamentary trust would also be a public record.



There could also be confusion or a lack of clarity within the will, and after a person passes away, the testamentary trust may not be established properly. By not establishing the trust when the person is alive, such as the case with a living trust, there is a risk that certain details could be overlooked and the wishes of the deceased are not properly executed.





Pros

Assets can be distributed to minors after they reach a certain age.
Instructions can be changed while alive.
This can be a low-cost option if money is tight while still living.



Cons

A testamentary trust does not avoid probate.
With probate, the deceased's assets are public record.
Risk exists that the trust may not be exactly as the deceased wanted.





   How to Create a Testamentary Trust  

There are many online resources one can use to create your own testamentary trust. However, these documents can become complicated, and inexperienced individuals may not fully understand the implications of the trust they are creating. If prepared incorrectly, there may be legal repercussions in the future.



To best make sure the testamentary trust meets your state's regulatory requirements, work with a lawyer on drawing up testamentary trust documents. In addition, this ensures appropriate legal discourse is written to ensure your assets are appropriately distributed.



To create the actual testamentary trust, the settlor must select the trustee and the beneficiary. Then, the settlor selects which assets are to be placed in the trust. This also includes the specification of how and when these assets are disbursed to the beneficiary. This information is communicated to the beneficiary in the last will and testament. When the settlor passes, the will passes through probate court. As mentioned above, after the probate process is completed, the trust is created and the funds can be disbursed.


   Example of a Testamentary Trust  

Consider that a benefactor established a testamentary trust for a beneficiary. Under the terms of the trust, they will receive half of the assets at age 35 and the second half at age 55. Let’s say the benefactor is leaving $200,000 to a beneficiary. Setting up a testamentary trust helps ensure a level of financial oversight, preventing the beneficiary from impulsive expenditures at an early age.



Consider another example where the deceased trustor has created a testamentary trust for their spouse, who is a Medicaid applicant. Assets in the testamentary trust may be used to pay for medical expenses that are not covered under Medicaid, such as specialist evaluation, special equipment, or additional therapy. Under a testamentary trust, the value of assets will not factor into the spouse's Medicaid eligibility.




What Is a Testamentary Document?
A testamentary document is a document that is added to a person's will outlining specific information or instructions. A testamentary document could include a confidentiality agreement or an indemnity document, which may remove all financial, legal liability for a person or party.




Why Do You Need a Letter of Testamentary?
A letter of testamentary is important since it is issued by the probate court, assigning the executor or executrix named in a person's will with the legal power to act on behalf of the deceased person's estate. The letter of testamentary, along with the person's death certificate, is usually needed in order for the executor to conduct financial transactions on behalf of the estate.




Do I Need a Lawyer to Get a Letter of Testamentary?
Typically, a lawyer or attorney is necessary to get a letter of testamentary during the probate process, particularly if there are multiple beneficiaries. However, laws can vary, depending on each state, and in some cases, a non-attorney may be allowed to manage the probate process for a deceased person.


   The Bottom Line  

A testamentary trust can be an effective estate planning and wealth management tool that help ensure a person's beneficiaries receive the assets they're entitled to after the person has passed away. However, there are many types of trusts available, and it's important to contact an expert, such as an attorney or financial professional, to determine what type of trust is best for specific financial circumstances.
What Is Tether (USDT)?  

Tether (USDT) is a cryptocurrency stablecoin pegged to the U.S. dollar and backed "100% by Tether's reserves," according to its website. Tether is owned by iFinex, the Hong Kong-registered company that also owns the crypto exchange BitFinex.



Tether was launched as RealCoin in July 2014 and was rebranded as Tether in November 2014. Originally based on the Bitcoin blockchain, Tether now supports Bitcoin's Omni and Liquid protocols as well as the Ethereum, TRON, EOS, Algorand, Solana, and Bitcoin Cash (SLP) blockchains.



As of January 2023, Tether was the third-largest cryptocurrency after Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) and the largest stablecoin with a market capitalization of nearly $68 billion. In 2022, Tether's USDT accounted for most of the exchanges out of Bitcoin by value.





Key Takeaways

Tether (USDT) is a stablecoin, a type of cryptocurrency pursuing a steady valuation.Tether is used by investors who want to avoid the volatility typical of cryptocurrencies while holding funds within the crypto system.Tether's parent company paid nearly $60 million in fines in 2021 to settle two regulatory probes alleging it mishandled and misrepresented its reserves.Tether has expanded to other geographic areas, including China, Mexico, and the Eurozone.


   Understanding Tether  

Tether belongs to a fast-growing breed of cryptocurrencies called stablecoins, which aim to keep the price of their tokens stable, most commonly by tying it to the price of a traditional currency like the U.S. dollar.



Tether also issues tokens pegged to the euro, the offshore Chinese yuan, the Mexican peso, and gold, none with more than a small fraction of the market cap of its U.S. dollar-pegged USDT tokens.


  Pegged Defined  

The peg to a traditional currency, often backed by collateral reserves made up entirely or mostly of the pegged currency, ensures stablecoins aren't subject to the same price volatility as more speculative cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.


  Transparency  

Tether updates a breakdown of its reserves holdings daily on its website. As of Jan. 29, 2023, it reported assets of $67.8 billion for USDT. As of the same date, Tether reported holding 82.45% of its reserves in cash, cash equivalents, short-term deposits, and commercial paper; 4.69% in corporate bonds; 9.02% in secured loans to unaffiliated entities; and 3.85% in other investments, including digital tokens.






While Tether promotes that it backs every USDT with an equivalent amount of currency, this isn't entirely the truth, as the numbers above show. However, in the past it has honored its 1-to-1 commitment.


  Stabilization  

A stable value promotes using stablecoins as a medium of exchange like conventional money. As noted above, in practical terms, stablecoins have made it easier to speculate in cryptocurrency markets. Their rapid growth in popularity is also the result of stablecoins' use as collateral by decentralized finance (DeFi) lending and staking protocols.


   Tether History  

In November 2017, Tether reported the electronic theft of $31 million in USDT tokens, after which a hard fork was performed. By then, the company was already dealing with critics questioning the adequacy of its reserves and, as subsequent investigations would show, having trouble accessing banking services.


  2019  

In April 2019, New York Attorney General Letitia James obtained a court order enjoining Tether and BitFinex parent iFinex from further violations of New York law after determining that BitFinex had borrowed at least $700 million from Tether's reserves to offset BitFinex corporate and client funds frozen and ultimately seized from its Panamanian banking partner Crypto Capital Corp. in a money-laundering probe.






Tether is a chartered member of the Blockchain Alliance, a coalition that works to promote blockchain development and its legal uses.


  2021  

In February 2021, Tether and BitFinex settled the case by agreeing to pay a fine of $18.5 million, discontinue trading with any New York state residents or entities, and furnish information about its reserves to the New York Attorney General's office for the next two years.



In October 2021, the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) announced that Tether agreed to pay a $41 million fine "over claims that Tether stablecoin was fully backed by U.S. dollars." In fact, "Tether held sufficient fiat reserves in its accounts to back USDT tether tokens in circulation for only 27.6% of the days in a 26-month sample time period from 2016 through 2018," according to CFTC. Bitfinex agreed to pay a $1.5 million fine to settle separate CFTC allegations as part of the settlement.


  2022  

In May 2022, Tether's price briefly fell to as little $0.96 following the collapse in the value of a different stablecoin, TerraUSD (UST), from an issuer not affiliated with Tether or BitFinex. The price of Tether tokens quickly rebounded to more than $0.99, and Tether said it was continuing to honor redemption requests at a 1-to-1 ratio to the U.S. dollar.



Tether also launched MXNT, a stablecoin backed by the Mexican peso following earlier expansions into Europe (EURT) and China (CNHT).




How Is Tether Useful?
Tether helps investors move funds between cryptocurrency markets and the traditional financial system, minimizing volatility due to its 1-for-1 peg to traditional currencies. 




How Do I Buy USDT?
Tether tokens can be bought and sold on cryptocurrency exchanges, including Binance, CoinSpot, Bitfinex, and Kraken.




Is Tether a Stablecoin?
Yes, Tether is the first and best-known stablecoin in the crypto world. Other stablecoins include True USD (TUSD), Pax Dollar (USDP), and USD Coin (USDC).




How Does Tether Stay at $1?
Tether can remain near that price so long as it continues to hold its 1-to-1 ratio of the currency (or equivalents) it is pegged to.


   The Bottom Line  

Tether is a cryptocurrency that attempts to maintain a value peg to an underlying currency such as the dollar or euro. It does this by keeping enough actual currency in reserves that the cryptocurrency holds the same value as the fiat currency.



Tether is primarily used to convert cryptocurrencies to fiat to prevent slippage, or a decrease in value between transaction initiation and execution. However, there are times when it isn't exactly pegged to the fiat currency it is supposed to be tracking. For instance, when the exchange FTX collapsed in November 2022, Tether plummeted to nearly $0.995 but rebounded quickly, at times seeing much more than a 1-to-1 peg through January 2023.

What Is a Texas Ratio?  

The Texas ratio was developed to warn of credit problems at particular banks or banks in particular regions. The Texas ratio takes the amount of a bank's non-performing assets and divides this number by the sum of the bank's tangible common equity and its loan loss reserves. A ratio of more than 100 (or 1:1) indicates that non-performing assets are greater than the resources the bank may need to cover potential losses on those assets.





Key Takeaways

The Texas ratio assesses a bank’s financial position.The ratio is non-performing assets divided by the sum of a bank’s tangible common equity and loan loss reserves.  The higher the Texas ratio the more financial trouble a bank might be in. A high Texas ratio, however, doesn’t mean the bank will go bankrupt.


   How the Texas Ratio Works  

The Texas ratio was developed as an early warning system to identify potential problem banks. It was originally applied to banks in Texas in the 1980s and proved useful for New England banks in the early 1990s. The Texas ratio was developed by Gerard Cassidy and other analysts at RBC Capital Markets. Cassidy found that banks with a Texas ratio of greater than 100 tend to fail. 



During the 1980s Texas saw an energy boom. Banks financed the surge, but soon the oil surge died down and banks started to struggle. As a result, Texas saw the greatest number of bank failures from 1986 to 1992 in the nation. 



As part of the Texas ratio, non-performing assets include loans that are in default or real estate the bank has had to foreclose on. These could become expenses for the bank. On the other side, tangible equity does not include intangibles that cannot be used to cover losses, such as goodwill. 


   Special Considerations  

The Texas ratio is useful for investors as well as customers. Banking customers will assess the Texas ratio to ensure their money is safe. This is especially important if a customer has money outside the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) coverage limits—$250,000. 



The Texas ratio, like many financial ratios, is best utilized with other analyses. A high ratio doesn’t mean the bank will go bankrupt, as many banks can operate with high Texas ratios. 


   Example of the Texas Ratio  

A bank has $100 billion in non-performing assets. The bank’s total common equity is $120 billion. The Texas ratio is calculated as non-performing assets divided by tangible common equity. The ratio is 0.83 or 83%, or $100 billion / $120 billion. Although this is somewhat high, it’s best to look at the ratio in the historical context. Is the ratio rising or falling? If it’s falling then the bank may have a solid plan for keeping non-performing assets in check. 



There are a number of banks right now (as of March 2020) that have Texas ratios of over 100%. This includes First City Bank in Florida with a 646.6% Texas ratio and The Farmers Bank in Oklahoma at 134.0%. Both of these banks have assets between $75 and $150 million.﻿﻿
What Is Tezos?  

Tezos is a blockchain network hosting the associated digital token Tez (XTZ), which is also known as tezzie. Like other cryptocurrency blockchains, Tezos facilitates user participation in decentralized finance (DeFi), decentralized applications and non-fungible token (NFT) projects.



In contrast with other blockchains, Tezos precludes hard forks, or blockchain splits, with a blockchain-based governance mechanism that adopts and implements protocol upgrades chosen by voting proportional to users' economic stake in Tezos.





Key Takeaways

Tezos is a blockchain network linked to a digital token known as Tez, or tezzie.The network's governance is based on economic stakes and precludes forks.Tezos uses a proof-of-stake mechanism to validate blockchain transactions, which uses less energy than Bitcoin mining.Following a highly successful ICO, Tezos was dogged by a power struggle and lawsuits.After topping $8 in October 2021, the price of a Tez declined to just under a dollar by May 2023.


   History of Tezos  

Tezos was conceived by Arthur Breitman, a France native and former engineer at Google X and Waymo who went on to work as a quantitative analyst at Morgan Stanley (MS). It was developed with the participation of Kathleen Breitman, Arthur's wife and a former employee of the hedge fund Bridgewater Associates and R3, a software company. The couple reportedly met at an Anarcho-Capitalist meetup in New York.



In 2014, while still working at Morgan Stanley, Arthur Breitman published a white paper under a pseudonym outlining the principles behind Tezos. In July 2017, the Switzerland-based Tezos Foundation, headed by Swiss entrepreneur Johann Gevers, organized with the Breitmans an initial coin offering (ICO) for Tezos that proved to be the most successful ICO to date; by January 2021 it ranked as the seventh-largest crypto coin offering.



In 13 days, the ICO drew 66,000 Bitcoins and 361,000 ethers. The ICO was valued at $232 million at the time, with Bitcoin trading at $1,964. Tezos Foundation reported assets of $471 million as of Dec. 31, 2022.



Amid investor warnings regarding ICOs by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), including notice that some are investment securities subject to registration under U.S. law, the Tezos ICO was labeled a fundraiser of donations, though it eventually allocated Tez in proportion to outside contributions.



The distribution of coins was delayed first by a power struggle between the Breitmans and Johann Gevers, who ultimately stepped down as Tezos Foundation president in early 2018.



Nearly a year after the ICO, in June 2018, the Tezos Foundation said ICO "donors" awaiting their Tez allocations would have to first submit to know-your-customer (KYC) and anti-money-laundering (AML) verification. As of November 2020, Tezos had verified 94% of the ICO funds.



In March 2020 the Tezos Foundation, the Breitmans, and the Breitmans' company Dynamic Ledger Solutions settled for $25 million in a class action lawsuit brought on behalf of ICO participants looking to withdraw their investment.



Tez started trading just under $3 in July 2018 but fell to a low of $0.36 by December of that year. It peaked at $8.55 in October 2021 and was at $2.21 on June 9, 2022. Tez was up nearly 9% that day after Tether (USDT) said it would deploy its leading stablecoin on the Tezos network. Tez had a market capitalization of $1.99 billion, ranking 33rd among cryptocurrencies, as of the same date.


   Understanding Tezos  

Like Bitcoin and Ethereum, Tezos is a decentralized ledger that makes use of blockchain technology. Like Ethereum, Tezos is designed to make use of smart contracts. Depending on the source, “Tezos” is either the ancient Greek term for “smart contract” or (much more likely) the name discovered by an algorithm Arthur Breitman wrote to sift through names unclaimed on the internet and pronounceable in English.



Staking 8,000 Tez, known in the Tezos network as a roll, permits the owner to operate a network node earning a proportional share of Tez rewards for validating blockchain transactions. Holders of smaller Tez sums may delegate them to a network node known in Tezos parlance as a baker.



When additional Tez currency is created at the end of protocol upgrade cycles to compensate developers whose protocol upgrades are adopted, baker stakes are increased proportionately as an inflation adjustment.



Decisions on adopting protocol upgrades depend on voting by bakers in proportion to the size of their stakes, and the changes are automatically implemented throughout the blockchain. Final votes require the participation of owners holding at least 81% of the current coin supply.



All network activity and governance are decentralized, and the Tezos Foundation disclaims any role in its operations. Instead, it supports the development of Tezos infrastructure and dispenses grants and other funding to foster adoption of the network.


   How Tezos Is Different  

Tezos' governance protocols distinguish it from Bitcoin as well as Ethereum, which lack formal governance systems, and its insistence that the blockchain can't be forked also stands out among cryptocurrencies. The provision adjusting active stakes for the creation of new tokens is also unusual and is meant to encourage participation.



Additionally, Tezos backers say its proof of stakes model for blockchain validation consumes less energy than Bitcoin mining.






Cryptocurrencies are highly speculative and their prices are extremely volatile. Exercise due diligence and never risk more than you can afford to lose.


   The Future of Tezos  

It remains to be seen whether Tezos' inflation mechanism can really protect stakeholders over the long run by issuing them additional tokens.



The network's governance protocols and protections against blockchain forks do provide some advantages.



Tezos technology was used in a recent experiment by European central banks exploring the feasibility of launching a digital euro, a central bank digital currency.



Tezos has also attracted One Of, the NFT platform backed by music producer Quincy Jones.



Other use cases, including cryptocurrency yield farming dependent on rising crypto valuations and buoyant financial markets, may prove less resilient over time.

What Is the Greatest Generation?  

The Greatest Generation is a term used to describe those Americans who grew up during the Great Depression and fought in World War II, or whose labor helped win it. The term "the Greatest Generation" is thought to have been coined by former NBC Nightly News anchor and author Tom Brokaw in his book by the same name.



The Greatest Generation is also known as the "G.I. Generation" or the "WWII Generation."





Key Takeaways

The Greatest Generation commonly refers to those Americans who were born in the 1900s through the 1920s.The Greatest Generation members all lived through the Great Depression and many of them fought in World War II.These individuals have often been described as driven, patriotic, and team-players.The Greatest Generation members also tend to be the parents of the Baby Boomer generation.There are fewer than 100,000 of the Greatest Generation left today in the U.S.


   Understanding the Greatest Generation  

There are no precise dates that define when members of the Greatest Generation were born, though many give a range of the early 1900s to the mid-1920s. The common characteristic of Greatest Generation members is that they lived through and experienced the hardships of the Great Depression and later either fought in World War II or worked in the industries that contributed to winning the war.



Newsman Tom Brokaw is often credited with popularizing the term through his book, The Greatest Generation, which profiled people who came of age during World War II and was inspired by Brokaw's attendance at the 40th-anniversary commemoration of the D-Day invasion of mainland Europe. Brokaw's profiles focused on the soldiers who fought the war, as well as the workers whose labor provided the essential material and services in support of them.






In Australia, the equivalent of the Greatest Generation is known as the "Federation Generation."


   How Many Remain?  

The youngest members of the Greatest Generation, if using 1925 as the last year they were born, would be nearing their 100s, Today, there are just under 100,000 centenarians living in the United States.



As for WWII veterans, in 2022 there were only about 250,000 left out of the 16 million who served in World War II. And, around 372 Greatest Generation veterans are thought to be lost every day to old age. According to research by the Washington Post, the final member of the Greatest Generation should die around the year 2046 if they can reach age 120 given advances in health care and improvements in life expectancy.


   Characteristics of the Greatest Generation  

While every individual is unique, demographers and sociologists have identified some common characteristics that often vary from generation to generation.



Among the Greatest Generation, individuals tend to have the following characteristics:



They are patrioticThey are driven and motivatedThey show a strong work ethicThey live modestlyThey are frugal consumers and prudent saversThey are committed and loyal



Many of these are thought to stem from living through World War I and the Great Depression as children, and then fighting in or living through World War II after that.


   The Greatest Generation and Other Demographics  

Generally speaking, the Greatest Generation are the parents of the "Baby Boomers" and are the children of the "Lost Generation" (those who grew up during or came of age during World War I). They preceded what is known as the "Silent Generation," a cohort born between the mid-1920s to the early-to-mid 1940s. The grandchildren of the Greatest Generation are members of Generation X, Generation Y, and their great-grandchildren tend to be Millennials and Gen Z.



Members of the Greatest Generation currently fall into the "retirees" demographic and are currently collecting Social Security benefits. The differences between generations have been extensively studied and socio-economic models have been created to help plan for future government expenditures and programs to plan for changes in current demographics.




Why Are They Called the Greatest Generation?
"The Greatest Generation" was popularized by former NBC Nightly News anchor and author Tom Brokaw in his book by the same name. The term was meant as a tribute to the resilience and patriotic spirit of those who lived through the Great Depression and then fought in World War II.




What Are the Seven Living Generations?
Greatest generation (b. ~1900-1925)Silent generation (~1925-1945)Baby boomers (~ 1945-1965)Generation X (~1965-1980)Millennials (~1980-1995)Generation Z (~1995-2010)Generation Alpha (~2010- )




How Many Americans Remain From the Greatest Generation?
The youngest members of the Greatest Generation, if using 1925 as the last year they were born, would be approaching their 100s as of the year 2022. As of 2022, there are estimated to be around 100,000 centenarians living in the United States.


   The Bottom Line  

The Greatest Generation refers to those Americans born between 1900 and 1925, many of whom fought during World War II. These individuals grew up during WWI and lived through the Great Depression and are often the parents of the Baby Boomer generation. All of this has led these people to be characterized by a great deal of patriotism, commitment to work and family, frugal lifestyles, and motivation to work hard to succeed. The term itself was popularized by a book by newsman Tom Brokaw, entitled The Greatest Generation, which was first published in 1998.
What Is a Theoretical Ex-Rights Price – TERP?  

A theoretical ex-rights price (TERP) is the market price that a stock will theoretically have following a new rights issue. Companies may use a new rights issuance to offer more shares to shareholders, usually at a discounted price. Stock prices are affected by new rights issuance because it increases the number of shares outstanding.





Key Takeaways

TERP is the theoretical market price of a stock after the completion of a rights offering.New rights issues result in an increase in the number of shares available and therefore have an impact on the price of the underlying stock.Typically, rights offerings give shareholders the chance to buy more shares at a discounted price, causing a dilution effect.Generally, the TERP will be lower than the pre-offering market price immediately following the rights issuing period.


   Theoretical Ex-Rights Price Explained  

A theoretical ex-rights price is a consideration for stock issued through a rights offering. Typically, rights offerings are only available for current shareholders and only offered for a short time (approximately 30 days). Rights offerings usually give shareholders the option to buy a proportioned number of shares at a discounted, pre-specified price. The portion each shareholder is allowed to purchase is based on the shareholder's current stake in the organization. The goal is to raise additional capital with preference given to current shareholders.



Stock rights offerings can be a popular event for investors and traders as they may create potential arbitrage opportunities through the rights offering period. Overall the rights offering period can somewhat mitigate efficient market trading as it creates uncertainty over the stock’s price.



Generally, stock rights offerings are tools managers can use in raising capital through the stock. Management may choose to use stock rights offerings to generate additional interest in a company’s stock. Since rights offerings are commonly offered at a discounted price, stock rights usually have a diluting effect on a stock’s price. As such, the TERP is usually lower than the pre-offering market price.


   Calculation of a Theoretical Ex-Rights Price  

The theoretical ex-rights price is usually calculated immediately following the last day of a stock’s rights offering. This calculation makes the stock’s price somewhat arbitrary and potentially more enticing for arbitrage trades throughout the rights offering period.



The simplest way to create a TERP estimate is to add the current market value of all shares existing before the rights issue to the total funds raised from the rights issue sales. This number is then divided by the total number of shares in existence after the rights issue is complete. This calculation results in the value of an individual share after the offering.



Throughout the offering period, all types of investors can speculate on the number of shares expected to be taken by shareholders, but usually, only current shareholders can participate. The basis for speculation in this scenario involves the number of share rights available, the expected demand, and the rights offering price. Companies may have various types of disclosure for this information which can make the estimate even more difficult.






The theoretical ex-rights price (TERP) is often lower than the stock's price before the offering because rights offerings are usually discounted, diluting the stock price.


   Investor Analysis  

Investors can compare the TERP to the current value of a share and their expectations for future market appreciation. Since rights are offered at a discounted price, the more rights exercised, the more the stock’s price becomes diluted. However, throughout the rights offering period, supply and demand still affect the market price so while dilution is occurring, investor demand can still increase the prevailing market price. Investors who are bullish on the stock long term may be more motivated by the offering while bearish or short-term investors may not see as much upside.


   Real-World Example  

Management of ABC Company has chosen to issue a rights offering. The provisions of the offering allow each shareholder to buy shares in the offering based on the percentage of their outstanding shares. The new shares are offered to investors at a discounted price to the market price. Shareholders can use the TERP to determine the estimated value of the shares after the rights issue. This amount will differ from the current market price.



It is possible for multiple theoretical estimated values to be calculated for the stock before the end of the offering period based on some different scenarios. An investor might look at the TERP value if 25% of the shares are purchased in the rights offering versus 50%, 75%, or 100%. Overall the more shares bought, the greater the potential for dilution when the shares are sold at a discounted offering price.
What is the Theoretical Value (Of A Right)?  

The theoretical value (of a right) is the value of a subscription right. During the period of time when a new rights offering is announced up until three days before the subscription rights expire (known as the cum rights period), the value of the right is specific and can easily be calculated. To calculate the value of a right during the window in which it is effective, and investor must be told the subscription price and the number of rights required to buy one share of stock. With that information the value of the right can be calculated using the following formula:



(Stock Price - Rights subscription price per share) / (Number of rights required to buy one share + 1)





Key Takeaways

The theoretical value of a right can be calculated during the cum rights period.Investors with subscription rights are told the price for which they can purchase the shares—usually at a discount to current market price.These same investors are told how many rights are necessary to purchase one share of stock.From this information the theoretical price can be calculated.


   Understanding Theoretical Value (Of A Right)  

The theoretical value of a right and the market value of a right are generally the same or very similar. It is also known as the intrinsic value of the right. Because the value of stock shares that have rights attached to them during the cum rights period may differ from regular shares without such rights, investors want to know this theoretical value.


   Real-World Example of Theoretical Value of a Right  

As an example, the current price of a stock is $40, the exercise price (or subscription price) is $35 and four rights are required to purchase a share. The theoretical value of the right is:



($40 - $35) / (4 + 1) = $1.



The period of time about three days before expiration is referred to as the exercise of rights period. These are the last days to exercise rights, but a period too soon to purchase new shares with rights, since the trade will settle before the record date, the day the rights expire. The theoretical value during the exercise of rights period—when rights trade independently of the stock—differs from the value during the cum rights period.



The calculation for the value during the exercise of rights period is:



(Stock price - Right subscription price) / Number of rights needed to buy a share.



Continuing from the above example, the stock price during the ex-rights period is $38, the theoretical value of the right during the exercise rights period would be ($38 - $35) / 4 = $0.75.



A right’s value is calculated using the same parameters used for pricing options, including the rights subscription price, prevailing interest rates, time to expiration, and the share price of the underlying stock, taking into consideration the level of its volatility. The major difference is that rights have significantly less time value than most options because of their comparatively short lifespan.


   Theoretical Nil Paid Price  

If an investor chooses to sell his or her right outright in the market, or if they choose to let the right lapse, which may result in a minimal administrative charge, they will receive the theoretical nil paid price of the right. This value is calculated by determining the difference between the subscription price the investor paid and the theoretical ex-right price.



Considering the example used above, the calculation for a theoretical nil paid price looks like this: $40 - $38 = $2. Thus, the amount the investor would receive for the right is twice the value of the right during the cum rights period and even greater than the value of the right during the ex-rights period.
What Is the Theory of Price?  

The theory of price is an economic theory that states that the price for a specific good or service is determined by the relationship between its supply and demand at any given point. Prices should rise if demand exceeds supply and fall if supply exceeds demand.





Key Takeaways

The theory of price is an economic theory that states that the price for any good or service is based on the relationship between its supply and demand.The optimal market price is the point at which the total number of items available can be reasonably consumed by potential customers.When supply and demand are in sync, the market is said to have achieved equilibrium.Supply may also be affected by factors such as the availability of raw materials; demand may fluctuate depending on competitor products, an item's perceived value, or its affordability to the consumer market.


   Understanding the Theory of Price  

The theory of price—also referred to as "price theory"—is a microeconomic principle that says the market forces of supply and demand will determine the logical price point for a particular good or service at any given time.



In a free market economy, producers typically want to charge as much as they reasonably can for their goods and services, while consumers want to pay as little as they can to obtain them. Market forces will cause the two sides to meet somewhere in the middle, at a price consumers are willing to pay and that producers are willing to accept.



When the quantity of a good or service that's available matches the demand of potential consumers for it, the market is said to achieve equilibrium. The concept of price theory allows for price adjustments as market conditions change.


   Relationship of Supply and Demand to Price Theory  

Supply denotes the number of products or services that the market can provide. This includes both tangible goods, such as automobiles, and intangible ones, such as the ability to make an appointment with a skilled service provider. In each instance, the available supply is finite in nature. There are only a certain number of automobiles available and only a certain number of appointments available at any given time.



Supply may be affected by forces that are beyond a producer's control, such as the availability of raw materials.



Demand applies to the market's desire for tangible or intangible goods. At any time, there is also only a finite number of potential consumers available. Demand may fluctuate depending on a variety of factors, such as whether an improved version of a product is available or if a service is no longer needed. Demand can also be affected by an item's perceived value by the consumer market.



As mentioned earlier, equilibrium occurs when the total number of items available—the supply—can be consumed by potential customers. If a price is too high, customers may avoid the goods or services or find other alternatives. This would result in excess supply and possibly cause producers to lower prices.



In contrast, if a price is too low, demand may significantly outpace the available supply, causing prices to rise again.



The optimal price, taking into account both supply and demand, is also referred to as the clearing price.


   Example of the Theory of Price  

Companies often differentiate their product lines vertically, rather than horizontally, considering consumers' differential willingness to pay for quality. As noted by Michaela Draganska of Drexel University and Dipak C. Jain of INSEAD in the journal Marketing Science, many firms offer products that vary in characteristics like color or flavor, but that do not vary in quality.



Their study found that using uniform prices for all products in a particular product line tends to be the best pricing policy for producers.



For example, Apple Inc. offers several different MacBook Pro laptop computer models, with varying screen sizes, capabilities, and prices. The customer has a choice of two colors: silver and space gray. If Apple charged a higher price for a 13-inch silver MacBook Pro versus an otherwise identical space gray one, demand for the silver model might fall, and the available supply of the silver model would increase. At that point, Apple might be forced to reduce the price of that model.




What Is the Difference Between Microeconomics and Macroeconomics?
Microeconomics focuses on interactions between individual consumers and the producers of goods and services, while macroeconomics looks at the economy as a whole.




What Is Elasticity of Demand?
Elasticity of demand, or price elasticity of demand, measures how sensitive the demand for a particular good or service is to changes in its price. If raising the price of a product will have little effect on the demand for it, it is said to be relatively inelastic.




What Is a Demand Curve?
The demand curve is a graphic illustration of how prices affect supply and demand. As prices rise, the quantity of a particular good or service that consumers demand will decline. Conversely, as prices fall, demand rises.




What Is a Supply Curve?
A supply curve illustrates the relationship between prices and supply. As the price rises for a particular good or service, the more of it producers will be motivated to provide.When a demand curve and a supply curve for a particular item are overlaid on the same graph, the point at which they intersect is referred to as the equilibrium point. That's the price at which the quantity consumers are willing to buy and the quantity producers are willing to deliver are perfectly matched.


   The Bottom Line  

The theory of price in microeconomics states that the price of a particular good or service is determined by the relationship between producer supply and consumer demand at any given point. Prices should rise if demand exceeds supply and fall if supply exceeds demand. When supply and demand are equal, the market is said to have achieved equilibrium.
What Is the Theory of the Firm?  

In neoclassical economics—an approach to economics focusing on the determination of goods, outputs, and income distributions in markets through supply and demand—the theory of the firm is a microeconomic concept that states that a firm exists and make decisions to maximize profits.



A firm maximizes profits by creating a gap between revenue and costs.





Key Takeaways

In neoclassical economics, the theory of the firm is a microeconomic concept that states that a firm exists and make decisions to maximize profits.The theory of the firm influences decision-making in a variety of areas, including resource allocation, production techniques, pricing adjustments, and the volume of production.Modern takes on the theory of the firm sometimes distinguish between long-run motivations, such as sustainability, and short-run motivations, such as profit maximization. 


   Understanding the Theory of the Firm  

Neoclassical economics dominates mainstream economics today, so the theory of the firm (and other theories associated with neoclassicism) influences decision-making in a variety of areas, including resource allocation, production techniques, pricing adjustments, and the volume of production.



While early economic analysis focused on broad industries, as the 19th century progressed, more economists began to ask basic questions about why companies produce what they produce and what motivates their choices when allocating capital and labor.



However, the theory has been debated and expanded to consider whether a company's goal is to maximize profits in the short-term or long-term. Modern takes on the theory of the firm sometimes distinguish between long-run motivations, such as sustainability, and short-run motivations, such as profit maximization.



If a company's goal is to maximize short-term profits, it might find ways to boost revenue and reduce costs. However, companies that utilize fixed assets, like equipment, would ultimately need to make capital investments to ensure the company is profitable in the long-term. The use of cash to invest in assets would undoubtedly hurt short-term profits but would help with the long-term viability of the company.



Competition (not just profit) can also impact the decision making of company executives. If competition is strong, the company will need to not only maximize profits but also stay one step ahead of its competitors by reinventing itself and adapting its offerings. Therefore, long-term profits could only be maximized if there's a balance between short-term profits and investing in the future.


   Theory of the Firm vs. Theory of the Consumer  

The theory of the firm works side by side with the theory of the consumer, which states that consumers seek to maximize their overall utility. In this case, utility refers to the perceived value a consumer places on a good or service, sometimes referred to as the level of happiness the customer experiences from the good or service. For example, when consumers purchase a good for $10, they expect to receive a minimum of $10 in utility from the purchased good.


   Special Considerations  
  Risks to Companies that Adhere to the Theory of the Firm  

Risks exist for companies that subscribe to a profit-maximization goal. Solely focusing on profit maximization comes with a level of risk in regards to public perception—and a loss of goodwill between the company, consumers, investors, and the public.



A modern take on the theory of the firm proposes that maximizing profits is not the only driving goal of a company, particularly with publicly held companies. Companies that have issued equity or sold stock have diluted their ownership. This scenario (of low equity ownership by the decision-makers in the company) can lead to chief executive officers (CEOs) having multiple goals, including profit maximization, sales maximization, public relations, and market share.



Further risks exist when a firm focuses on a single strategy within the marketplace in order to maximize profits. If a company relies on the sale of one particular good for its overall success, and the associated product eventually fails within the marketplace, the company can fall into financial hardship. Competition and the lack of investment in its long-term success—such as updating and expanding product offerings—can eventually drive a company into bankruptcy.
What Is There Ain't No Such Thing as a Free Lunch (TANSTAAFL)?  

"There ain't no such thing as a free lunch" (TANSTAAFL), also known as "there is no such thing as a free lunch" (TINSTAAFL), is an expression that describes the cost of decision-making and consumption. The expression conveys the idea that things appearing free always have some cost paid by somebody, or that nothing in life is truly free.



A free lunch refers to a situation where there is no cost incurred by the individual receiving the goods or services being provided, but economists point out that even if something were truly free there is an opportunity cost in what is not taken.





Key Takeaways

"There ain't no such thing as a free lunch" (TANSTAAFL) is a phrase that describes the cost of decision-making and consumption.TANSTAAFL suggests that things that appear to be free will always have some hidden or implicit cost to someone, even if it is not the individual receiving the benefit.In investing, buying Treasury bills is an example of someone thinking they are getting a good deal for very little. But the tradeoff in buying Treasuries is the opportunity cost of not being invested in higher-risk, higher-reward securities over time.


   How TANSTAAFL Works  

The TANSTAAFL concept is important to consider when making various types of decisions, whether they be financial or lifestyle. The concept can help consumers make wiser decisions by considering all indirect and direct costs and externalities.



In economics, TANSTAAFL describes the concept of opportunity costs, which states that for every choice made, there is an alternative not chosen which would also have produced some utility. Decision-making requires trade-offs and assumes that there are no real free offerings in society. For example, products and services gifted (free) to individuals are paid for by the person giving the gift. Even when there is no one to assume the direct costs, society bears the burden, as in the case of negative externalities like pollution.



Investors must remain particularly wary of a seemingly free lunch when dealing with investments that promise a stream of fairly high, fixed payments over a period of multiple years with supposedly low risk. Many of these investments remain laden with hidden fees, some of which may not be fully understood by investors. In general, any investment that promises a guaranteed return is not a free lunch because there is some implicit cost somewhere, including the opportunity cost of not investing elsewhere.



There is also the implicit cost related to unseen risks. Some brokerages heavily marketed mortgage-backed securities (MBS) as an apparent free lunch in the early 2000s. These investments were described as being very safe, AAA-rated investments, backed by a diversified pool of mortgages. However, the housing crisis in the U.S. exposed the true underlying risk of these investments, as well as a faulty ratings system that classified pools of loans as AAA, even when many of the underlying loans carried very substantial default risks.






Even products and services given to individuals for free are not truly free; a company, government, or individual ultimately pays the cost.


   History of the TANSTAAFL Concept  

The concept of TANSTAAFL is thought to have originated in 19th-century American saloons where customers were given free lunches with the purchase of drinks. From the basic structure of the offer, it is evident that there is an implicit cost associated with the free lunch: the purchase of a drink. 



However, there are additional unseen costs resulting from the consumption of the free lunch. Because the lunches were high in salt, customers were enticed to purchase more drinks. So the saloons purposely offered free lunches with the expectation that they would generate enough revenue in additional drinks to offset the cost of the lunch. The proposal of a free good or service with the purchase of another good or service is an oxymoronic tactic many businesses still use to entice customers.



TANSTAAFL has been referenced many times historically in a variety of different contexts. For example, in 1933, former New York City mayor Fiorello H. La Guardia used the Italian phrase “È finita la cuccagna!" (translating to "no more free lunch”) in his campaign against crime and corruption. Popular references to the phrase can also be found in Robert Heinlein's "The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress" as well as in Milton Friedman’s book “There Ain't No Such Thing as a Free Lunch.”


   Examples of TANSTAAFL  

Across different disciplines (e.g., economics, finance, statistics, etc.), TANSTAAFL has different connotations. For example, in science, it refers to the theory that the universe is a closed system. The idea is that a source of something (e.g., matter) comes from a resource that will be exhausted. The cost of the supply of matter is the exhaustion of its source. 



In sports, TANSTAAFL was used to describe the health costs associated with being great at a sport, like "no pain, no gain." Despite the different meanings, the common factor is cost. 



For investments, TANSTAAFL helps to explain risk. Treasury bills (T-bill), notes, and bonds offer a nearly risk-free return; however, the opportunity cost of investing in one of these instruments is the foregone opportunity to invest in an alternative, riskier investment. As an investor moves higher on the risk spectrum, the phrase TANSTAAFL becomes even more relevant as investors provide capital with hopes of achieving larger gains than what less-riskier securities yield; however, this choice assumes the cost that growth prospects may not be achieved and the investment could be lost.
What Is Theta?  

The term "theta" refers to the rate of decline in the value of an option due to the passage of time. It can also be referred to as the time decay of an option. This means an option loses value as time moves closer to its maturity, as long as everything is held constant. Theta is generally expressed as a negative number for long positions and as a positive number for short positions. It can be thought of as the amount by which an option's value declines every day.





Key Takeaways

Theta refers to the rate of decline in the value of an option over time.If all other variables are constant, an option will lose value as time draws closer to its maturity.Theta, usually expressed as a negative number for long positions, indicates how much the option's value will decline every day up to maturity.

   Understanding Theta  

Theta is part of the group of measures known as the Greeks, which are used in options pricing. Remember—options give the buyer the right to buy or sell an underlying asset at the strike price before the option expires.



The strike price, which is also called an exercise price, is set when the contract is first written, informing the investor of the price at which the underlying asset must reach before the option can be exercised.



The measure of theta quantifies the risk that time poses to option buyers since options are only exercisable for a certain period of time. This is known as time decay or the erosion of the value of an option as time passes. An option's profitability decreases as time goes on.



But what happens when two options are similar but one expires over a longer period of time? The value of the longer-term option is higher since there is a greater chance or more time that the option could move beyond the strike price.



Because theta represents the risk of time and the loss of value of an option, it is generally expressed as a negative figure for long positions. The value of the option diminishes as time passes until the expiration date. Since theta is always negative for long options, there will always be a zero time value when the option expires.



This is why theta is a good thing for sellers but not for buyers—value decreases from the buyer's side as time goes by, but increases for the seller. That's why selling an option is also known as a positive theta trade—as theta accelerates, the seller's earnings on their options increase.


   Special Considerations  

If all else remains equal, the time decay causes an option to lose extrinsic value as it approaches its expiration date. Therefore, theta is one of the main Greeks that option buyers should worry about since time works against long option holders.



Conversely, time decay is favorable to an investor who writes options. Option writers benefit from time decay because the options written become less valuable as the time to expiration approaches. Consequently, it is cheaper for option writers to buy back the options to close out the short position.



Put a different way, option values are, if applicable, composed of both extrinsic and intrinsic values. At option expiration, all that remains is the intrinsic value, if any, because time is a significant part of the extrinsic value.


   Theta vs. Other Greeks  

The Greeks measure the sensitivity of options prices to their respective variables. For instance, the delta of an option indicates the sensitivity of an option's price in relation to a $1 change in the underlying security while the gamma of an option indicates the sensitivity of an option's delta in relation to a $1 change in the underlying security.



Vega indicates how an option's price theoretically changes for each one percentage point move in implied volatility.






Drawn from the Greek alphabet, theta has numerous meanings across different fields—in economics, it also refers to the reserve ratio of banks in economic models.


   Example of Theta  

Let's assume an investor purchases a call option with a strike price of $1,150 for $5. The underlying stock is trading at $1,125. The option has five days until expiration and theta is $-1. In theory, the value of the option drops $1 per day until it reaches the expiration date. This is unfavorable to the option holder.



Assume the underlying stock remains at $1,125 and two days have passed. The option will be worth approximately $3. The only way the option becomes worth more than $5 again is if the price rises above $1,155. This would give the option at least $5 in intrinsic value ($1,155 - $1,150 strike price), offsetting the loss due to theta or time decay.




Is Theta Good for Options?
In options trading, a positive theta equals selling time for a short options seller. As time moves forward, the option becomes cheaper, which is good for the seller. This option seller will realize a profit if the underlying asset is neutral, bearish for a short call, and bullish for a short put.




Which Option Has the Highest Theta?
The highest theta is for at-the-money options and the lowest theta is for the furthest out-the-money and in-the-money options. For an option that is at-the-money or as close as possible, the absolute value of theta rises as the expiration date is reached.




Does Theta Decay on Weekends?
Yes, theta decays on weekends. Options models usually take into consideration weekends, so decay will occur over seven days for five trading days.
What Is a Third Party?  

A third party is an individual or entity that is involved in a transaction but is not one of the principals and, thus, has a lesser interest in the transaction. An example of a third party would be the escrow company in a real estate transaction; the escrow party acts as a neutral agent by collecting the documents and money that the buyer and seller exchange when completing the transaction.



A collection agency may be another example of a third party. If a debtor owes a creditor a sum of money and hasn't been making the scheduled payments, the creditor is likely to hire a collection agency to ensure that the debtor honors his agreement.





Key Takeaways

Third parties work on behalf of one or more individuals involved in a transaction.In the case of a real estate transaction, an escrow company works to protect all parties in the transaction.In the case of third party debt collection, the third party sides with the lender to recover as much of the outstanding debt as possible and is incentivized accordingly. Third party is also used to refer to outsourcing certain functions to an outside company to ensure efficient service for clients. 


   How a Third Party Works  

A third party may also refer to an entity that a company uses to mitigate risk. For example, small investment firms face difficulty entering the industry when large firms continue leading the competition. One reason large firms grow more quickly is because they invest in middle- and back-office infrastructure. To stay competitive, many smaller firms outsource those functions as a method of gaining a greater share of the marketplace.



Small firms save time and money by leveraging scalable infrastructure with variable costs for trade operations, data storage, disaster recovery, and system integration and maintenance. By outsourcing middle- and back-office solutions, small firms take advantage of technology and processes for more efficient task completion, maximum operating efficiency, reduced operational risks, decreased reliance on manual processes, and minimal errors. Operational costs are reduced, compliance is enhanced, and tax and investor reporting improve.


   Example of a Third Party  
  Real Estate Escrow Company  

A real estate escrow company acts as a third party to hold deeds, documents, and funds involved in completing real estate transactions. The company deposits the funds in an account on behalf of the buyer and the seller. The escrow officer follows the directions of the lender, the buyer, and the seller in an efficient manner when handling the funds and documentation involved in the sale. For example, the officer pays authorized bills and responds to the principals’ authorized requests.



Although the escrow process follows a similar pattern for all homebuyers, the details differ among properties and specific transactions. The officer follows instructions when processing the escrow and, upon meeting all written requirements, delivers the documents and the funds to the appropriate parties before closing the escrow.


  Collection Agency  

A company may hire a collection agency for securing payment of company debt. Company invoices or initial customer contracts typically state at which time a collection agency may be used for securing outstanding payments. Some businesses can carry debt for years, whereas others expect payment within 90 days. The schedule depends on the market and the company’s relationship with the client.



When a business would pay more in court fees than the amount of the debt itself, the business may utilize a collection agency’s services instead of filing a lawsuit. The agency may pay the business 10% or less for each outstanding invoice, or it may agree to a large percentage of commission for recovered debts. The agency consolidates the company’s debt and goes to work recovering the outstanding balances.
What Is Third-Party Insurance?  

Third-party insurance is a policy purchased by the insured (first party) from the insurance company (second party) for protection against the claims of another (third party). A common example of third-party insurance is car insurance, which is designed to protect you against the claims of other drivers in case of an accident.





Key Takeaways

Third-party insurance covers an individual or firm against a loss caused by some third party, such as car insurance.The first party is the insured, the second party is the insurer, and the third party is the person causing the loss or claim.The two main categories of third-party insurance are liability coverage and property damage coverage.Most people are required by law to carry different forms of insurance on their homes and vehicles.

   Understanding Third-Party Insurance  

Third-party insurance is essentially a form of liability insurance. The first party is responsible for their damages or losses, regardless of the cause of those damages. One of the most common types is third-party insurance is automobile insurance.



Third-party offers coverage against claims of damages and losses incurred by a driver who is not the insured, the principal, and is therefore not covered under the insurance policy. The driver who caused the damages is the third party.



For auto insurance, there are two types of third-party liability coverage:



Bodily injury liability: Covers costs resulting from injuries to a person, such as hospital care, lost wages, or pain and suffering due to an accidentProperty damage liability: Covers costs resulting from damages to or loss of property, such as replacing landscaping and mailboxes, or compensation for loss of use of a structure.



In some cases, third-party insurance may be required by law. Drivers, for example, must carry at least a minimal amount of bodily injury liability and property damage liability coverage. These coverage requirements vary from state to state. A few states do not require both or have other limitations. Each state sets its minimum requirement for each type of coverage.



Even in “no-fault” states, liability coverage is all but essential. No-fault laws do not protect you from million-dollar injury lawsuits stemming from seriously injured third parties.






No-fault laws were established to reduce or eliminate ordinary injury lawsuits affixed with low-dollar price tags and an overwhelming number of claims for pain and suffering.



Both types of third-party insurance are important for individuals, such as homeowners, with substantial assets to protect. The more money and assets an insured has, the higher the limit should be for each type of liability coverage.


   Special Considerations  

In most countries, third-party or liability insurance is compulsory for any party sued by a third party. Public liability insurance involves industries or businesses that take part in processes or other activities that may affect third parties, such as subcontractors, architects, and engineers. Here, the third party can be visitors, guests, or users of a facility. Most companies include public liability insurance in their insurance portfolio to protect against damage to property or personal injury.



Product liability insurance is typically mandated by legislation, which varies by country and often varies by industry. This insurance covers all major product classes and types, including chemicals, agricultural products, and recreational equipment. It protects companies against lawsuits over products or components that cause damage or injury.




What Is the Importance of Third-Party Insurance?
Third-party insurance is a form of liability insurance. It offers the insured coverage for injury or damage they have caused to another person or business. Without third-party insurance, a person or business could end up paying extremely high damages to someone they have injured, whether or not the injury was intentional.




Who Are the Parties in Third-Party Insurance?
For an insurance policy, the first party is the person or business that purchases the insurance (the insured). The second party is the company providing the insurance (the insurer). A third party is some outside person or business that makes a claim for damages from the first party.




What Is the Difference Between First-Party and Third-Party Claims?
In a first-party claim, the insurance company makes a payment directly to the insured person or business. In a third-party claim, the payment is made to someone other than the insured or insurer. This happens when the insured person is liable for damages. If your homeowner's insurance repays you for a repair to your roof, that's a first-party claim. But if it pays for the medical bills of someone who slipped on your front steps, that's a third-party claim.


   The Bottom Line  

Third-party insurance is a form of liability insurance that covers you when someone makes a claim against you for damages. A common example of this is auto insurance, which will pay another driver who is injured in an accident that you have caused. Another common type of third-party insurance is for property damage.



Third-party insurance protects you against having to potentially pay thousands or tens of thousands of dollars in claims. Like other forms of insurance, you may not need it. But if you do, it could save you extremely large amounts of money, or even protect you from bankruptcy.
What Is a Third-Party Transaction?  

A third-party transaction is a business deal that involves a person or entity other than the main participants. Typically, it would involve a buyer, a seller, and another party—the third party. The involvement of the third party can vary, based on the type of business transaction.



In some cases, the involvement is one-time, such as a third-party payment for an item purchased from a website. Sometimes the involvement is longer term, such as a third-party vendor always used by a certain company.





Key Takeaways

A third-party transaction often involves a seller, a buyer, and an additional party not connected to the others.Examples of third-party transactions are everywhere in daily life, including Insurance brokers, mortgage brokers, and online payment portals. The number of people and businesses participating in third-party transactions has exploded in the digital era through online payment platforms.


   Understanding Third-Party Transactions  

When a buyer and seller enter into a business deal, they may decide to use the services of an intermediary or third party that manages the transaction between both parties. The role of the third party can vary. It may include designing the particulars of the deal in question, providing a specific service for a company that is slightly outside its wheelhouse, serving as the middleman that connects two parties, or serving as the means of receiving payment from the buyer and forwarding that payment to the seller.



Third-party transactions are important for various accounting policies and occur in a variety of situations. Importantly, the third party is not affiliated with the other two participants in the transaction. For example, if Firm A sells inventory to its subsidiary, Firm B, a third-party transaction occurs when Firm B sells those final goods to Firm C.


   Example of a Third-Party Transaction  

Many kinds of transactions involve third parties, and they take place on a day-to-day basis across a variety of industries.



For example, in the insurance industry, insurance brokers are third-party agents that market insurance products to insurance shoppers. The client goes through the broker to secure a good insurance contract that has reasonable rates and terms, while the insurance company works through the broker to bring in a new client. If the broker is successful in bringing a new client to an insurance provider, it is paid a commission by the insurer.



In the same light, a mortgage broker is considered a facilitator in third-party transactions, as they will attempt to match the needs of a potential homebuyer with the loan programs offered by a lender.






Through digital platforms, a buyer can make a payment for the purchase of a good or service bought from a third party.


   Special Considerations  

As technology evolves and changes the way interactions are handled in the digital era, more people and businesses are participating in third-party transactions through online payment platforms.



Through digital platforms, a buyer can make a payment for the purchase of a good or service bought from another party. That third-party provider receives the payment from the buyer, verifies that the funds are available, and debits the buyer’s account. The money is then forwarded to the seller’s account—typically on the same online portal. The seller’s account may be credited in minutes or days, but the funds may be withdrawn to a bank account or used to conduct other transactions once the deposit has been made in the account.



PayPal is one good example of an online payment portal that acts as a third party in a retail transaction. A seller offers a good or service, and a buyer uses a credit card entered through the PayPal payment service. The payment is run through PayPal and is thus a third-party transaction.
What Is the Third World?  

"Third World" is an outdated and derogatory phrase that has been used historically to describe a class of economically developing nations. It is part of a four-part segmentation that was used to describe the world’s economies by economic status. Third World falls behind First World and Second World but was ahead of Fourth World, though Fourth-World countries were hardly recognized at all. Today, the preferred terminology is a developing nation, an underdeveloped country, or a low- and middle-income country (LMIC).


   Defining Developing Nations  

There can be a few ways to divide up the world for purposes of economic segmentation. Classifying countries as First, Second, Third, and Fourth World was a concept created during and after the Cold War, which ran from approximately 1945 to the 1990s.



In general, nations are typically characterized by economic status and key economic metrics like gross domestic product (GDP), GDP growth, GDP per capita, employment growth, and an unemployment rate. In developing countries, low production rates and struggling labor market characteristics are usually paired with relatively low levels of education, poor infrastructure, improper sanitation, limited access to health care, and lower costs of living.



Developing nations are closely watched by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank, which seek to provide global aid for the purposes of projects that help to improve infrastructure and economic systems comprehensively. Both organizations refer to these countries as lower-middle or low-income countries.



Developing nations, or LMIC, can be the target of many investors seeking to identify potentially high returns through possible growth opportunities, though risks are also relatively higher. While developing countries are generally characterized as performing poorer economically, innovative and industrial breakthroughs can lead to substantial improvements in a short amount of time.





Key Takeaways

A Third World country is an outdated and offensive term for a developing nation characterized by a population with low and middle incomes, and other socio-economic indicators.The International Monetary Fund, World Bank, and World Trade Organization allow for certain benefits and contractual term provisions for countries that meet certain types of economic status classifications.

The classification of nations as First World or Third World emerged during and after the Cold War. First-World countries were known as the most highly industrialized nations whose views aligned with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and capitalism.



Second-World countries supported communism and the Soviet Union. Most of these countries were formerly controlled by the Soviet Union. Many countries of East Asia also fit into the Second-World category.



Third-World countries included nations in Asia and Africa that were not aligned with either the United States or the Soviet Union. Now, in part because the Soviet Union no longer exists, the definition of Third World is outdated and may be considered offensive to many.


  Alfred Sauvy Coined the Term  

Alfred Sauvy, a French demographer, anthropologist, and historian, is credited with coining the term Third World during the Cold War. Sauvy observed a group of countries, many former colonies, that did not share the ideological views of Western capitalism or Soviet socialism. "Three worlds, one planet," wrote Sauvy in a 1952 article published in L'Observateur.﻿﻿


   Dividing the World  

In the modern-day, most countries on Earth fall into one of three general categories that some refer to as developed, emerging, and frontier. The world segmentations have somewhat migrated to fit within these categories overall.



The developed countries are the most industrialized with the strongest economic characteristics. The emerging countries are classified as such because they demonstrate significant strides in various economic growth areas though their metrics are not as stable. The frontier markets often closely mirror the old Third-World classification and often show the lowest economical indicators.


   Frontier Markets List  

The evolutions of the worldly segmentations have become historic and obsolete. As such, one barometer for assessing a list of developing countries is MSCI’s Frontier Markets Index. This index includes the following countries:



CroatiaEstoniaIcelandLithuaniaKazakhstanRomaniaSerbiaSloveniaKenyaMauritiusMoroccoNigeriaTunisiaWAEMUBahrainJordanOmanBangladeshPakistanSri LankaVietnam


   Other Definitions of Developing Nations  

The World Trade Organization (WTO), also provides another point of reference. The WTO divides countries into two classes: developing and least developed. There are no criteria for these classifications so countries self-nominate, though statuses can be contested by other nations.



The WTO segregation comes with certain rights for developing country status. For example, the WTO grants developing countries longer transition periods before implementing agreements that aim to increase trading opportunities and infrastructure support related to WTO work.



As an offshoot of the WTO, the Human Development Index (HDI) is another economic status metric developed by the United Nations to assess the social and economic development levels of countries. The HDI measures and then ranks a country based on schooling, life expectancy, and gross national income per capita.



The World Health Organization and the United Nations uses Least Developed Countries (LDC) to describe a set of 48 countries with low socioeconomic developmental indicators. This list is reassessed every few years. These indicators are a combination of gross national income, human assets (nutrition, life expectancy, secondary school education, adult literacy), and economic vulnerability (population size, remoteness, merchandise export concentration, agriculture, exports, and natural disaster preparedness).

Thomas Robert Malthus was an influential British economist who is best known for his theory on population growth, outlined in his 1798 book An Essay on the Principle of Population.



In it, Malthus argued that populations inevitably expand until they outgrow their available food supply, causing the population growth to be reversed by disease, famine, war, or calamity.



He is also known for developing an exponential formula used to forecast population growth, which is currently known as the Malthusian growth model.





Key Takeaways

Thomas Malthus was an 18th-century British philosopher and economist noted for the Malthusian growth model, an exponential formula used to project population growth.The theory states that the supply of food cannot keep up with the growth of the human population, inevitably resulting in disease, famine, war, and calamity.A noted statistician and proponent of political economy, Malthus founded the Statistical Society of London.Malthus' theories were later used to justify British colonial policies that worsened the human toll of the Irish Potato Famine.His theory is now largely dismissed, as modern farming techniques have allowed food production to scale much faster than Malthus could have anticipated.












   Understanding the Ideas of Thomas Malthus  

In the 18th and early 19th centuries, some philosophers believed firmly that human society would continue to improve and tilt toward a utopian ideal. Malthus countered this belief, arguing that segments of the general population have invariably been poor and miserable, effectively slowing population growth.



Based on his observation of conditions in England in the early 1800s, Malthus argued that the available farmland was insufficient to feed the increasing population. More specifically, he stated that the human population increases geometrically, while food production increases arithmetically.



Under this paradigm, humans would reproduce until their numbers surpassed their production capacity, at which point the population would be forcibly reduced by famine or some other catastrophe and return to a manageable level.


  The Dismal Science  

These conclusions inspired the description of economics as the "dismal science." Originally coined by the philosopher Thomas Carlyle, the term was used to describe Malthus' conclusions regarding the inevitability of overpopulation and famine.



The naturalist Charles Darwin based his theory of natural selection in part on Malthus' analysis of population growth. Malthus' views also enjoyed a resurgence in the 20th century with the advent of Keynesian economics.


   Malthus' Early Life and Education  

Thomas Malthus was born on Feb. 13, 1766, to a prominent family near Guildford, Surrey. Malthus was home-schooled before being accepted to Cambridge University's Jesus College in 1784. He earned a master's degree in 1791 and became a fellow two years later. In 1805, Malthus became a professor of history and political economy at the East India Company's college at Haileybury.



Malthus became a fellow of the Royal Society in 1819. Two years later, he joined the Political Economy Club along with economist David Ricardo and Scottish philosopher James Mill. Malthus was elected to be one of 10 royal associates of the Royal Society of Literature in 1824.



In 1833, he was elected to both the Académie des Sciences Morales et Politiques in France as well as Berlin's Royal Academy. Malthus co-founded the Statistical Society of London in 1834.



He died in St. Catherine, near Bath, Somerset in 1834.


   Published Works of Thomas Malthus  

Malthus' most famous work was his Essay on the Principle of Population, first published in 1798 and enlarged in later editions. This work contained his famous argument that human populations tend to grow faster than agricultural output, resulting in famines or crises.



Later editions proposed that "moral restraint" could slow population growth.



Malthus was a prolific essayist and exchanged many letters with contemporary economists. His other publications included:



The Present High Price of Provisions (1800), in which Malthus criticized England's Poor Laws and argued that aid to the poor would encourage them to have more children than they would otherwise.Observations on the Effect of the Corn Laws (1814), in which Malthus argued in favor of importing corn from abroad rather than supporting the protectionist Corn Laws.Principles of Political Economy (1820), a major work in which Malthus outlined his views on free trade in response to the economist David Ricardo, who had written a book with the same title.






The term "political economy" was first used in academic circles when Malthus joined the faculty of the East India Company's college at Haileybury as a professor of history and political economy. 


   Malthus and Population Growth  

Malthus' severe theory on population growth was shaped by his status as an 18th-century Anglican cleric. He believed that poor people would work hard enough to produce an abundant food supply in favorable times. However, he thought that they would then abuse their newfound abundance, particularly by producing larger families. At some point, their numbers would exceed their ability to provide the necessities of life. Starvation or some other disaster would inevitably follow until the population was reduced to manageable levels.



In short, Malthus was something of a misanthrope, although he denied it. In his Principle of Population, he wrote that humans are by nature "inert, sluggish, and averse from labour, unless compelled by necessity."



He argued against England's Poor Laws on the grounds that "the aggregate mass of happiness" would be increased if the very poor were denied lifesaving relief.


   Criticism of Thomas Malthus  

The population theory espoused by Malthus has been largely discredited over time. Technological advances invalidated his main conclusion. His theory was made repugnant by some of the political decisions that it influenced.



However, his theory of the effects of "gluts" or overproduction continued to influence economists, including John Maynard Keynes, who further developed the analysis of the cycle of boom and bust that defines an economy.


  An Outdated Conclusion  

Malthus' theory that population growth would inevitably exceed its means of production was based largely on his observation of English life in the late 18th century and his later travels in Europe.



The advances of the Industrial Revolution allowed agricultural production to be ramped up to far greater levels than the subsistence farming of his day could sustain. Later advances in farming techniques, chemical fertilizers, and genetic modifications have allowed food production to continue to scale upwards.



For example, the Green Revolution of the 1960s in India, which boasts the world's second-biggest population, helped feed a growing population in the state of Punjab. In Europe after World War II, populations increased steadily without widespread starvation.


  An Excuse for Political Malpractice  

If simplified enough, Malthus' theory sounds a lot like Ebenezer Scrooge's declaration that the poor might as well just die and "decrease the surplus population."



Malthus' theory of population was used to support genocidal policies in colonial India. Malthus was not even alive at the time of the Irish Potato Famine of the mid-19th century, but contemporary politicians leaned on his theory to blame Irish overpopulation rather than British government policies for the massive death toll.




What Did Malthus Predict About Population Growth?
Malthus predicted that natural population growth would inevitably outpace agricultural output, ultimately resulting in famine and other catastrophes until the population was reduced below a sustainable level.The cycle is endless, he believed: Relative abundance causes an increase in fertility until the population again grows to an unsustainable level and collapses.




How Did Thomas Malthus Influence Charles Darwin?
Darwin's theory of natural selection was influenced by Malthus' population theories. Darwin found that limited resources place competitive pressures on every species. Darwin's revelation was that a species adapted over time to improve its rate of survival.




What Is the Malthusian Growth Model?
The Malthusian growth model is a mathematical equation for population growth. It holds that the rate of growth is proportionate to the current population. This is functionally equivalent to exponential growth, where the size of the population doubles at predictable intervals.


   The Bottom Line  

Thomas Malthus was an 18th-century British economist best known for his theory that human populations tend to outgrow their agricultural production capabilities, resulting in famines and other disasters.



These theories have largely been discredited by innovations in agricultural technology, but they remain influential in the field of evolutionary biology.
What Are the Three Black Crows?  

Three black crows is a phrase used to describe a bearish candlestick pattern that may predict the reversal of an uptrend. Candlestick charts show the day's opening, high, low, and closing prices for a particular security. For stocks moving higher, the candlestick is white or green. When moving lower, they are black or red.



The black crow pattern consists of three consecutive long-bodied candlesticks that have opened within the real body of the previous candle and closed lower than the previous candle. Often, traders use this indicator in conjunction with other technical indicators or chart patterns as confirmation of a reversal.





Key Takeaways

Three black crows is a bearish candlestick pattern used to predict the reversal of a current uptrend.Traders use it alongside other technical indicators such as the relative strength index (RSI).The size of the three black crows candles and the shadow can be used to judge whether the reversal is at risk of a retracement.The opposite pattern of three black crows is three white soldiers, which indicates a reversal of a downtrend.


   Three Black Crows Explained  

Three black crows are a visual pattern, meaning that there are no particular calculations to worry about when identifying this indicator. The three black crows pattern occurs when bears overtake the bulls during three consecutive trading sessions. The pattern shows on the pricing charts as three bearish long-bodied candlesticks with short or no shadows or wicks.



In a typical appearance of three black crows, the bulls will start the session with the price opening modestly higher than the previous close, but the price is pushed lower throughout the session. In the end, the price will close near the session low under pressure from the bears.



This trading action will result in a very short or nonexistent shadow. Traders often interpret this downward pressure sustained over three sessions to be the start of a bearish downtrend.

   Example of How to Use Three Black Crows  

As a visual pattern, it's best to use three black crows as a sign to seek confirmation from other technical indicators. The three black crows pattern and the confidence a trader can put into it depends a lot on how well-formed the pattern appears.



The three black crows should ideally be relatively long-bodied bearish candlesticks that close at or near the low price for the period. In other words, the candlesticks should have long, real bodies and short, or nonexistent, shadows. If the shadows are stretching out, then it may simply indicate a minor shift in momentum between the bulls and bears before the uptrend reasserts itself.



Volume can make the three black crows pattern more accurate. Volume during the uptrend leading up to the pattern is relatively low, while the three-day black crow pattern comes with relatively high volume during the sessions. In this scenario, the uptrend was established by a small group of bulls and then reversed by a larger group of bears.



Of course, with markets being what they are that could also mean a large number of small bullish traders running into a smaller group of large volume bearish trades. The actual number of market participants matters less than the volume each is bringing to the table.


   Three Black Crows vs. Three White Soldiers  

The opposite of the three black crows pattern is the three white soldiers pattern, which occurs at the end of a bearish downtrend and predicts a potential reversal higher. This pattern appears as three long-bodied white candlesticks with short, or ideally nonexistent, shadows. The open occurs within the previous candlestick's real body, and the close occurs above the previous candlestick's close.



Three white soldiers are simply a visual pattern indicating the reversal of a downtrend whereas three black crows indicate the reversal of an uptrend. The same caveats apply to both patterns regarding volume and confirmation from other indicators.


   Limitations of Using Three Black Crows  

If the three black crows pattern involves a significant move lower, traders should be wary of oversold conditions that could lead to consolidation before a further move lower. The best way to assess the oversold nature of a stock or other asset is by looking at technical indicators, such as the relative strength index (RSI), where a reading below 30.0 indicates oversold conditions, or the stochastic oscillator indicator that shows the momentum of movement.



Many traders typically look at other chart patterns or technical indicators to confirm a breakdown, rather than using the three black crows pattern exclusively. As a visual pattern, it is open to some interpretation such as what is an appropriately short shadow.



Also, other indicators will mirror a true three black crows pattern. For example, a three black crows pattern may involve a breakdown from key support levels, which could independently predict the beginning of an intermediate-term downtrend. The use of additional patterns and indicators increases the likelihood of a successful trade or exit strategy.


   Real-World Example of Three Black Crows  

In the third week of May 2018, a three black crows pattern appeared on the GBP/USD weekly price chart, representing an ominous sign for the currency pairing. Analysts speculated that the three black crows pattern indicated that the pairing would continue to trend low. Three factors were analyzed to determine that the three black crows pattern signaled a continuing downturn:



The relatively steep upward trend of the bullish marketThe low wicks of each candle, indicating a small difference between the close and the week’s lowThe fact that, while the candles did not gradually elongate, the longest candle was the third day
What Is a Three-Sigma Limit?  

Three-sigma limits is a statistical calculation where the data are within three standard deviations from a mean. In business applications, three-sigma refers to processes that operate efficiently and produce items of the highest quality.



Three-sigma limits are used to set the upper and lower control limits in statistical quality control charts. Control charts are used to establish limits for a manufacturing or business process that is in a state of statistical control.





Key Takeaways:

Three-sigma limits (3-sigma limits) is a statistical calculation that refers to data within three standard deviations from a mean.Three-sigma limits are used to set the upper and lower control limits in statistical quality control charts.On a bell curve, data that lie above the average and beyond the three-sigma line represent less than 1% of all data points.


   Understanding Three-Sigma Limits  

Control charts are also known as Shewhart charts, named after Walter A. Shewhart, an American physicist, engineer, and statistician (1891–1967). Control charts are based on the theory that even in perfectly designed processes, a certain amount of variability in output measurements is inherent.



Control charts determine if there is a controlled or uncontrolled variation in a process. Variations in process quality due to random causes are said to be in-control; out-of-control processes include both random and special causes of variation. Control charts are intended to determine the presence of special causes.



To measure variations, statisticians and analysts use a metric known as the standard deviation, also called sigma. Sigma is a statistical measurement of variability, showing how much variation exists from a statistical average.






Sigma measures how far an observed data deviates from the mean or average; investors use standard deviation to gauge expected volatility, which is known as historical volatility.



To understand this measurement, consider the normal bell curve, which has a normal distribution. The farther to the right or left a data point is recorded on the bell curve, the higher or lower, respectively, the data is than the mean. From another point of view, low values indicate that the data points fall close to the mean; high values indicate the data is widespread and not close to the average.


   An Example of Calculating Three-Sigma Limit  

Let’s consider a manufacturing firm that runs a series of 10 tests to determine whether there is a variation in the quality of its products. The data points for the 10 tests are 8.4, 8.5, 9.1, 9.3, 9.4, 9.5, 9.7, 9.7, 9.9, and 9.9.



First, calculate the mean of the observed data. (8.4 + 8.5 + 9.1 + 9.3 + 9.4 + 9.5 + 9.7 + 9.7 + 9.9 + 9.9) / 10, which equals 93.4 / 10 = 9.34.
Second, calculate the variance of the set. Variance is the spread between data points and is calculated as the sum of the squares of the difference between each data point and the mean divided by the number of observations. The first difference square will be calculated as (8.4 - 9.34)2 = 0.8836, the second square of difference will be (8.5 - 9.34)2 = 0.7056, the third square can be calculated as (9.1 - 9.34)2 = 0.0576, and so on. The sum of the different squares of all 10 data points is 2.564. The variance is, therefore, 2.564 / 10 = 0.2564.
Third, calculate the standard deviation, which is simply the square root of the variance. So, the standard deviation = √0.2564 = 0.5064.
Fourth, calculate three-sigma, which is three standard deviations above the mean. In numerical format, this is (3 x 0.5064) + 9.34 = 10.9. Since none of the data is at such a high point, the manufacturing testing process has not yet reached three-sigma quality levels.


   Special Considerations  

The term "three-sigma" points to three standard deviations. Shewhart set three standard deviation (3-sigma) limits as a rational and economic guide to minimum economic loss. Three-sigma limits set a range for the process parameter at 0.27% control limits. Three-sigma control limits are used to check data from a process and if it is within statistical control. This is done by checking if data points are within three standard deviations from the mean. The upper control limit (UCL) is set three-sigma levels above the mean, and the lower control limit (LCL) is set at three sigma levels below the mean.



Since around 99.73% of a controlled process will occur within plus or minus three sigmas, the data from a process ought to approximate a general distribution around the mean and within the pre-defined limits. On a bell curve, data that lie above the average and beyond the three-sigma line represent less than 1% of all data points.
What Do Three White Soldiers Mean?  

Three white soldiers is a bullish candlestick pattern that is used to predict the reversal of the current downtrend in a pricing chart. The pattern consists of three consecutive long-bodied candlesticks that open within the previous candle's real body and a close that exceeds the previous candle's high. These candlesticks should not have very long shadows and ideally open within the real body of the preceding candle in the pattern.





Key Takeaways


Three white soldiers are considered a reliable reversal pattern when confirmed by other technical indicators like the relative strength index (RSI).
The size of the candles and the length of the shadow is used to judge whether there is a risk of retracement.
The opposite pattern of three white soldiers is three black crows, which indicates a reversal of an uptrend.



   What Do Three White Soldiers Tell You?  

The three white soldiers candlestick pattern suggests a strong change in market sentiment in terms of the stock, commodity or pair making up the price action on the chart. When a candle is closing with small or no shadows, it suggests that the bulls have managed to keep the price at the top of the range for the session. Basically, the bulls take over the rally all session and close near the high of the day for three consecutive sessions. In addition, the pattern may be preceded by other candlestick patterns suggestive of a reversal, such as a doji.



Here is an example of three white soldiers appearing in a pricing chart for the VanEck Vectors Fallen Angel High Yield Bond exchange traded fund (ETF).

The ETF had been in a strong bearish downtrend over the course of several weeks before the three white soldiers pattern marked a sharp bullish reversal. The pattern may suggest that the rally will continue, but traders may also look at other relevant factors before making a decision. For example, the stock may have reached an area of resistance or the move may have been on low volume.


   Example of How to Trade Three White Soldiers  

As three white soldiers is a bullish visual pattern, it is used as an entry or exit point. Traders who are short on the security look to exit and traders who are waiting to take up a bullish position see the three white soldiers as an entry opportunity.



When trading the three white soldiers pattern, it's important to note that the strong moves higher could create temporary overbought conditions. The relative strength index (RSI), for example, may have moved above 70.0 levels. In some cases, there is a short period of consolidation following the three soldiers pattern, but the short- and intermediate-term bias remains bullish. The significant move higher could also reach key resistance levels where the stock could experience consolidation before continuing to move higher.


   The Difference Between Three White Soldiers and Three Black Crows  

The opposite of the three white soldiers is the three black crows candlestick pattern. Three black crows consist of three consecutive long-bodied candlesticks that have opened within the real body of the previous candle and closed lower than the previous candle. Whereas three white soldiers catch the momentum shift from the bears to the bulls, three black crows show the bears taking control from the bulls. The same caveats about volume and additional confirmation apply to both patterns.


   Limitations of Using Three White Soldiers  

Three white soldiers can also appear during periods of consolidation, which is an easy way to get trapped in a continuation of the existing trend rather than a reversal. One of the key things to watch is the volume supporting the formation of three white soldiers. Any pattern on low volume is suspect because it is the market action of the few rather than the many.



To combat the limitation of visual patterns, traders use the three white soldiers and other such candlestick patterns in conjunction with other technical indicators like trendlines, moving averages and bands. For example, traders may look for areas of upcoming resistance before initiating a long position or look at the level of volume on the breakout to confirm that there was a high amount of dollar volume transacting. If the pattern occurred on low volume with near-term resistance, traders may wait until there is further confirmation of a breakout to initiate a long position.
What Are Thrifts?  

Even though they're not as common as they used to be, thrifts, or savings and loan associations, still play an important part in many consumers' lives. Thrifts also refer to credit unions and mutual savings banks that provide a variety of savings and loan services. Thrifts differ from commercial banks in that they can borrow money from the Federal Home Loan Bank System, which allows them to pay members higher interest.


   Understanding Thrifts  

Thrifts, along with commercial banks and credit unions, qualify as depository institutions. Most people are familiar with commercial banks and credit unions, but the line becomes fuzzy when defining a thrift. Thrifts are essentially savings and loan associations that help members' savings grow at a higher interest rate. More importantly, they are savings banks that specialize in real estate.



Originally, thrifts only offered savings accounts and time deposits, but over the past 20 years, the banks' scope of services has expanded to meet the needs of the average consumer. They now offer the same products as credit unions and commercial banks.


   Commercial Banks vs. Thrifts  

Commercial banks, like most corporations, are in it for the profit. They have no specific mandate in terms of asset class. Shareholders own these organizations, and, like most corporations, the goal is to grow earnings. The range of powers given to commercial banks is mainly determined by state and federal law, as both issue bank charters.



Corporate charters, and the powers granted to banks under state and federal law, determine the range of the banks' activities. Commercial banks receive deposit insurance from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) and are under the Federal Reserve System. Furthermore, what commercial banks lose in terms of member savings they gain in convenience; with thousands of branches nationwide, you won't have trouble finding a local office if you run into an emergency while traveling.



By contrast, thrifts specialize in mortgages and real estate lending. The first mandate is to the members of the thrift, not profit. Like commercial banks, thrifts may be chartered by either the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) or by the state. The FDIC also insures them. Thrifts tend to retain their loan portfolio rather than securitize loans so members with atypical profiles that don't fit into agency mortgage standards may stand a better chance of securing a loan through a local thrift than a national commercial bank.


   Qualified Thrift Lender  

Due to their charter, thrifts are mandated to focus on housing-related assets and must be members of the Federal Home Loan Bank System. Originally, thrifts were required to have at least 65% of their portfolio in housing-related assets; this threshold was referred to as the qualified thrift lender (QTL) test as it was a measure of adherence to the original charter.



One benefit to passing the QTL test is that thrifts also get to borrow from the Federal Home Loan Bank System, which translates into higher interest for depositors compared to commercial banks.
What Is a Thrift Bank?  

A thrift bank—also just called a thrift—is a type of financial institution that specializes in offering savings accounts and originating home mortgages for consumers. Thrift banks are also sometimes referred to as Savings and Loan Associations (S&Ls). Thrift banks differ from larger commercial banks, like Wells Fargo or Bank of America, because they usually offer higher yields on savings accounts and provide limited lending services to businesses.



While a thrifts' core offerings are traditional savings accounts and home loan origination, these institutions also offer checking accounts, personal and car loans, and credit cards for consumers. However, they give primary attention to home financing for single-family residences. Thrifts are structured either as corporate entities that are owned by their shareholders, or they are mutually owned (i.e., owned by their borrowers and depositors).





Key Takeaways

A thrift bank—also called a Savings and Loan Association (S&L)—is a type of financial institution that specializes in offering savings accounts and originating home mortgages for consumers.While a thrifts' core offerings are traditional savings accounts and home loan origination, these institutions also offer checking accounts, personal and car loans, and credit cards for consumers.In the years since the Savings and Loan Crisis—which occurred between 1986 and 1995)—many structural changes have been made to thrift banks that have blurred some of the distinctions between them and conventional banks.


   History of Thrift Banks  

The thrift institution began with the establishment of the customer-owned building society in the United Kingdom at the beginning of the 18th century. In the U.S., the first successor to the U.K.'s customer-owned building society was referred to as Savings and Loan Associations (S&Ls). One of the main impetuses for the founding of S&Ls in the U.S. was to make improvements to the market for mortgages in the U.S.



At the beginning of the 20th century, the typical U.S. mortgage was a five-to-10-year, interest-only loan that had to be refinanced or paid off with a large balloon payment at the end of the term. Homeowners often defaulted on these payments, especially as levels of unemployment rose during the Great Depression as levels of unemployment rose.



In 1932, President Herbert Hoover passed the Federal Home Loan Bank Act, an Act that was aimed at encouraging homeownership by providing member banks with a source of low-cost funds for use in extending mortgage loans. This act was the first in a series of bills that sought to make homeownership a more achievable goal for more Americans in the first half of the 20th century.



In addition, as a result of this act the Federal Home Loan Bank Board was created. This Board was tasked with facilitating the development of a secondary market for mortgages; it created S&Ls to issue those mortgages. 


   The Impact of Thrift Banks  

One of the major impacts of thrift banks—coupled with a mortgage insurance program created by the Veterans Administration in 1944–was the facilitation of home purchases in the aftermath of WWII. Many young war veterans and their families were able to purchase homes in the suburbs because of these federal programs.



In the 1960s and 1970s, the majority of mortgages were issued through thrifts and S&Ls. As a result of these institutions, and other federal programs, rates of homeownership in the U.S. rose significantly between 1940 and 1980.






By law, loans to commercial businesses can account for no more than 20% of a thrift bank's business.



During the Savings and Loan Crisis, which occurred between 1986 and 1995, many thrift institutions and S&Ls failed. While analysts have come up with a number of explanations for the huge decline in the industry, in general, the failure has been attributed to poor lending practices.



In the years since the Crisis, many structural changes have been made to thrift banks that have blurred some of the distinctions between them and conventional banks. The Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989 (FIRREA) had a significant impact on the S&L and thrift industry.



In 2010, the Dodd-Frank Act eliminated some of the key advantages of thrifts, such as less stringent regulations than those applied to major banks. The commitment of the thrifts to serving consumers continues, however. The most important purpose of S&Ls is still to make mortgage loans on residential property.




What Are Some Types of Thrift Banks?
Thrift banks include savings banks, private development banks, and stock savings and loan associations.




What Is the Difference Between Thrift Banks and Commercial Banks?
Thrift banks operate similarly to traditional banks, but they are designed to serve consumers rather than businesses. In other words, thrifts primarily offer consumer accounts and loans, while commercial banks also offer financial services to businesses. Thrifts are generally smaller, local institutions and don't have the reach and resources of large banks with branches nationwide. However, thrift banks are increasingly offering the same services as commercial banks, creating less of a distinction between the two.




What Are Mutual Savings Banks?
Many thrift banks are also mutual savings banks, meaning that account holders are also shareholders of the bank. In this sense, mutual banks are similar to credit unions, but the main difference between mutual banks and credit unions is that the former are for-profit, while the latter are nonprofit.


   The Bottom Line  

Commercial banks, thrift banks, and credit unions are the three major types of depository institutions in the United States.



Thrift banks, also known as savings and loans associations (S&Ls), or simply thrifts, are financial institutions primarily funded by consumer deposits. A thrift specializes in offering savings accounts and originating home mortgages for consumers.



Thrifts also offer many of the same services as commercial banks, including debit and credit cards and savings and checking accounts.
What Is the Thrift Savings Plan (TSP)?  

A thrift savings plan (TSP) is a retirement investment program open only to federal employees and uniformed service members, including the Ready Reserve. It is a defined-contribution (DC) plan that offers federal employees many of the same benefits that are available to workers in the private sector.



A TSP closely resembles a 401(k) plan offered by private employers.





Key Takeaways


A thrift savings plan is similar to a 401(k) plan for federal employees and uniformed services personnel.
Participants in a TSP can get an immediate tax break for their savings.
They can also choose to invest in a Roth for freedom from taxes after retirement.
Plan participants can put their money into any of six investing options.
You can roll over a 401(k) and IRAs into a TSP if you leave the private sector to work in a public one. If you leave a public service job with a TSP, you can also roll it over to a 401(k) or IRA.



   How the Thrift Savings Plan (TSP) Works  

There are several ways to invest in a Thrift Savings Plan. These can include:



Automatic payroll contributions
Agency matching contributions
Tax-deferred contributions into a traditional TSP (withdrawals are taxed in retirement)
After-tax investments in a Roth TSP (withdrawals are untaxed in retirement)



No matter the type of TSP or contribution structure you choose, the contribution limit is $22,500 for 2023 (up from $20,500 in 2022). Employees aged 50 and over can also make catch-up contributions of $7,500 in 2023 (up from $6,500 in 2022).



Employees new to federal employment can roll over 401(k) and individual retirement account (IRA) assets into a TSP. Rollovers can also go in the opposite direction if federal employees move to the private sector.






A thrift savings plan (TSP) is a defined-contribution retirement plan with advantages similar to private-sector plans.


   The TSP Investment Options  

The TSP offers a choice of six funds and a mutual fund option:



The Government Securities Investment (G) FundThe Fixed-Income Index Investment (F) FundThe Common-Stock Index Investment (C) FundThe Small-Capitalization Stock Index Investment (S) FundThe International-Stock Index Investment (I) FundSpecific Lifecycle (L) fundsMutual Fund Window



The F, S, C, and I funds in the TSP are index funds currently managed by the BlackRock Institutional Trust Company under contract by the Federal Retirement Thrift Investment Board (FRTIB). This independent government agency administers the TSP and acts as a fiduciary that is legally liable to manage the TSP prudently and in the best interests of participants and their beneficiaries.



Index funds in the TSP are designed to mimic the return characteristics of the corresponding benchmark index. For example, the C Fund is invested in a fund that replicates the S&P 500 Index, which is made up of the stocks of 500 large- to medium-sized U.S. companies. L funds are invested in the five individual TSP funds, and their asset allocations are based on the individual investor’s time horizon.





$22,500

The maximum annual contribution to a Thrift Savings Plan in 2023. If you are 50 or older, you can add an extra $7,500.



The mutual fund window is for TSP participants who want more flexibility in their retirement investments. You can invest a portion of your TSP savings through the TSP mutual fund window into available mutual funds you choose. However, there are certain requirements for participating in the mutual fund window, such as having at least $40,000 in your TSP account and not investing more than 25% of your account balance in mutual funds using the window.


   TSPs vs. IRAs  

Comparing the TSP to an IRA is not an either/or proposition—you can have both a TSP and an IRA at the same time. One primary difference between them is their respective contribution limits. For 2023, the annual limit is $22,500 for a TSP (with a catch-up contribution of $7,500 for those over 50, the limit is $30,000); for an IRA, it is much less—$6,500 ($7,500 if you are over 50)—if you have multiple IRAs, this is the total amount you can contribute. Thus, a TSP allows you to build your retirement funds faster than an IRA if you have the extra money to do so.


  Employer Matching  

Another big difference is in the employer match. The federal government provides a sliding percentage scale of matching contributions for your TSP. Even if you contribute nothing, it will contribute 1% of your annual salary to your TSP. The scale tops out at a 5% government match if you contribute 5% of your salary to your TSP, thus doubling the amount of money invested. Because an IRA is something you set up for yourself, with no employer involved, there are no matching contributions.


  Fees and Expenses  

The investment fees also differ. TSP fees are pretty low, usually around 0.05%, and transparent. In the private sector, IRA investment fees can range from 0.5% to 2.5%, depending on the kind of fund, and it can sometimes be difficult to know exactly how much they are in aggregate. However, IRAs offer more investment opportunities than TSPs, as they are limited to the six funds discussed above. This allows an IRA holder to be more aggressive in their investment strategies than a TSP holder.


  Withdrawals  

Some final differences have to do with withdrawals. Traditional IRAs and TSPs, as well as Roth TSPs, have required minimum distributions (RMDs) that start at age 73 (up from 72 in previous years). With an IRA, you are allowed to take whatever withdrawals you like, without a penalty, starting at age 59½ as long as it meets the minimum required.



TSPs only allow you to withdraw monthly, quarterly, or annually. You can request that the payment be a specific dollar amount or an amount based on your life expectancy and account balance that is recomputed annually.



IRAs also have an early withdrawal penalty of 10% for any money taken out when you are younger than 59½. However, if you retire at age 55 or older, TSPs will waive the 10% penalty. Even better, if you qualify under Federal Employees Retirement System (FERS) special provisions, this age drops to 50.


   How Do I Contact TSP Administrators?  

You can call their toll-free Thriftline at 877-968-3778, Monday through Friday, from 7 a.m. to 9 p.m. ET. There is also an international phone line at 404-233-4400 that is not a toll-free line. The 711 TTS Relay is available for people with hearing or speech disabilities by dialing 711. You can also use AVA, the TSP virtual assistant, from your TSP account page.





TSP General Mailing Address

Thrift Service Center, C/O Broadridge Processing, P.O. Box 1600, Newark, NJ 07101-1600.



The Message Center allows you to send and receive messages if you have an online account. Response time is two business days.




Is a TSP the Same Thing As a 401(k)?
Not exactly, though they are structured similarly and have the same contribution limits. A TSP is what the federal government offers instead of a 401(k), the type of plan offered by private employers. It is possible to have both if you have worked for both a government and a private employer. However, the total contribution to these retirement plans cannot exceed the annual contribution limits set by the Internal Revenue Code.




Is a TSP Better Than an IRA?
TSPs and IRAs both have benefits. With a TSP, you can contribute considerably more each year, expect matching contributions from the federal government, and pay lower investment fees. You have greater control over your investments with an IRA, and there are no limits on withdrawals from it upon retirement. You can borrow from your TSP (up to $50,000), but you cannot typically borrow from an IRA account.




What Happens to My Thrift Savings Plan If I Quit My Job?
If you quit your job, your Thrift Savings Plan will remain as is if the balance is $200 or more, and it will continue earning. However, if you're not fully vested as a FERS or BRS employee, the government may withdraw its contributions and the associated earnings from your account. From there, you can control the principal in the account and adjust your investments, but you cannot make any more contributions.


   The Bottom Line  

The Thrift Savings Plan is a retirement plan for federal employees and servicemembers. It is similar to private sector plans like the 401(k) but is more limited in choices and flexibility. The limitations exist to ensure employees can make good decisions about their retirement investing. However, they can use some of the funds in the account to invest as they see fit in approved mutual funds, giving them investment flexibility if desired.



The TSP is not necessarily better or worse than other retirement plans—it exists as a retirement planning option for government employees and servicemembers similar to those available to employees in the private sector.
What Is Throughput?  

Throughput, in business, is the amount of a product or service that a company can produce and deliver to a client within a specified period of time. The term is often used in the context of a company's rate of production or the speed at which something is processed.



Businesses with high throughput levels can take market share away from their lower throughput peers because high throughput generally indicates that a company can produce a product or service more efficiently than its competitors.





Key Takeaways

Throughput is a term used to describe the rate at which a company produces or processes its products or services.The goal behind measuring the throughput concept is often to identify and minimize the weakest links in the production process.Assumptions about capacity and the company's supply chain can affect throughput.Maintaining high throughput becomes a challenge when different products are being produced using a combination of joint and separate processes.When a company can maximize its throughput, it can also maximize its revenues.


   Understanding Throughput  

The idea of throughput, also known as the flow rate, is part of the theory of constraints in business management. The guiding ideology of this theory is that a chain is only as strong as its weakest link. The goal for business managers is to find ways to minimize how the weakest links affect a company's performance and to maximize throughput for the product's end users. Once throughput is maximized by removing inefficiencies, allowing inputs and outputs to flow in the most ideal manner, a company can reach revenue maximization.



A company's level of production capacity is closely related to throughput, and management can make several types of assumptions about capacity. If the company assumes that production will operate continually without any interruptions, management is using theoretical capacity, but this level of capacity is not reachable. No production process can produce the maximum output forever because machines need to be repaired and maintained, and employees take vacation days. It's more realistic for businesses to use practical capacity, which accounts for machine repairs, wait times, and holidays.






Only products that are actually sold count toward throughput.


   Factors Affecting Throughput  

A company’s throughput also depends on how well the company manages its supply chain, which is the interaction between the company and its suppliers. If, for whatever reason, supplies are not available as an input to production, the disruption has a negative impact on throughput.



In many cases, two products may start in production using the same process, which means that the joint costs are allocated between each product. When production reaches the split-off point, however, the products are produced using separate processes. This situation makes it more difficult to maintain a high level of throughput.


   Formula and Calculation of Throughput  

Throughput can be calculated using the following formula:



T = I/F



where:



T = Throughput
I = Inventory (the number of units in the production process)
F = The time the inventory units spend in production from start to finish


   Benefits of Knowing Throughput Time  

Throughput time refers to the total amount of time that it takes to run a particular process in its entirety from start to finish. For example, a manufacturer can measure how long it takes to produce a product, from initial customer order to sourcing raw materials to manufacturing to sale.



Throughput time can be further broken down into components:



Processing time is how long all of the steps of producing a good or service takeInspection time involves running quality control and monitoring finished goodsMove time includes how long it takes to transport, ship, and deliver items across the logistics chainQueue time, or wait time, is computed as all idle time in between these other components.



Adding these together gives you the total throughput time. If you can identify areas where there are backlogs, bottlenecks, or slowdowns, company managers can address these and improve efficiency. Quicker throughput times increase return on investment (ROI) and profitability.






Throughput analysis is also a form of capital budgeting analysis, aiding companies in choosing which projects to undertake. Using throughput analysis, the entire company may be viewed as a single process.


   How to Increase Throughput  

Increasing throughput and decreasing throughput time are important goals for company managers. As such, there are several ways to help achieve this goal. One is to deploy real-time monitoring and data analysis of production processes, made easier with the help of technology. Applications that analyze throughput can quickly identify slowdowns or other anomalies so that they can be quickly addressed.



Another time-proven method is to use a standardized checklist of steps to follow in the process that must be ticked off every time. While this may seem tedious and redundant, studies have shown that committing to a checklist reduces errors and speeds up processes.



A third way, often used by companies in various industries, is to introduce a bit of competition among workers using a scorecard, where speed and efficiency are rewarded, and inefficiency is highlighted as a problem area.


   Example of Throughput  

ABC Cycles manufactures bicycles. The company has procedures in place to maintain equipment used to make bikes, and it plans production capacity based on scheduled machine maintenance and employee staffing plans.



However, ABC must also communicate with its metal bike frames and seat suppliers and get them to deliver these component parts when it requires them for production. If the parts don't arrive when ABC Cycles needs them, the company's throughput will be lower.



Going further, ABC Cycles begins building more than one type of bicycle. It starts the production of mountain and road bikes using a joint production process, and both bikes use the same bike frame and seat. Later on in the process, however, the production becomes separate because each bike model uses different tires, brakes, and suspensions. This makes production harder to manage since ABC must consider production capacity and supply chains in both joint and separate production processes.



Let's say that ABC Cycles has 200 bikes in inventory, and the average time that a bike is in the production process is five days. The throughput for the company would be:



T = (200 bikes / 5 days) = 40 bikes a day.




What Is the Difference Between Throughput Time and Lead Time?
Both lead time and throughput time are important measures of operational efficiency. Lead time measures the entire period between a customer order and ultimate delivery. Throughput time, in contrast, only measures the time it takes to pass through processes to produce the good or service.




How Do You Calculate Throughput?
In corporate finance, throughput is generally measured as inventories divided by the time it takes to produce those inventories.




How Can One Find a Bottleneck in a Business Process?
Having a clear schematic of a production process allows you to monitor each step to look for bottlenecks. If there is a slowdown, parts can accumulate at the end of one specific step. Today, these can be identified by automated systems that monitor and report on production. Once identified, they can try to be resolved.
What Is a Tick?  

A tick is a measure of the minimum upward or downward movement in the price of a security. A tick can also refer to the change in the price of a security from one trade to the next trade. Since 2001 and the advent of decimalization, the minimum tick size for stocks trading above $1 is one cent.





Key Takeaways


A tick is the minimum incremental amount at which you can trade a security. Since 2001 and the advent of decimalization, the minimum tick size for stocks trading above $1 is one cent.
An experiment undertaken at the behest of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in 2016 increased the tick for 1,200 small-cap stocks from one cent to five cents for two years to test the effect of larger tick sizes on trading.
The SEC's experiment revealed that larger tick sizes decrease trading activity and raise trading costs.



   Understanding a Tick  

A tick represents the standard upon which the price of a security may fluctuate. The tick provides a specific price increment, reflected in the local currency associated with the market in which the security trades, by which the overall price of the security can change.



Prior to April 2001, the minimum tick size was 1/16th of a dollar, which meant that a stock could only move in increments of $0.0625. While the introduction of decimalization has benefited investors through much narrower bid-ask spreads and better price discovery, it has also made market-making a less profitable (and riskier) activity.


   How a Tick Works  

Investments may have different potential tick sizes depending on the market in which they participate. For example, the E-mini S&P 500 futures contract has a designated tick size of $0.25, while gold futures have a tick size of $0.10. If a futures contract on the E-mini S&P 500 is currently listed at a price of $20, it can move one tick upward, changing the price to $20.25 based on the $0.25 tick size minimum. However, with that minimum tick size in place, the price of the security could not move from $20 to $20.10 because $0.10 is below the minimum tick size.



In 2015, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved a two-year pilot plan to widen the tick sizes of 1,200 small-cap stocks. This was done to promote research and trading in publicly-traded companies with market capitalization levels around $3 billion, as well as trading volumes below one million shares daily on average. The pilot looked to widen the tick size for the selected securities to determine the overall effect on liquidity.



The pilot program began on October 3rd, 2016 and ended just shy of its two-year expiration date on Friday, September 28, 2018.


   Results of the SEC's Tick Size Pilot Program  

According to an article by Bill Alpert in Barron's, called "Congress’ Failed Stock Market Experiment Cost Investors $900 Million," the idea for increasing tick sizes for small-cap stocks originated with David Weild IV, a former Vice President at NASDAQ who is informally known as the father of the JOBS Act.



Weild IV argued that because brokers, particularly smaller brokers, had lost money because of the diminishment of ticks spreads in 2001, they no longer put the time and effort into researching and promoting small-cap stocks. Increasing the tick size, he said, would be an incentive for brokers to look at these stocks again, and consequently more investment capital would flow to them, boosting their ability to grow their businesses, hire workers and grow the economy.



Weild's argument was circuitous and didn't convince regulators or observers. However, he did secure the support of Delaware Democrat John Carney and Wisconsin Republican Sean Duffy. Their co-sponsored bill passed the U.S. House of Representatives, prompting the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to institute its program.



The results of the pilot program were clear: increasing the tick size for small stocks created "a significant decrease in liquidity in the limit order book" according to one paper, and "a stock price decrease between 1.75% and 3.2% for small spread stocks" according to another paper.



The project failed, according to Alpert, because of tectonic changes in stock markets in the 2000s and 2010s. The rise of discount brokers and DIY internet trading undermined the old system where "market-making was dominated by 'bulge-bracket' brokers with teams of bankers, analysts, and salesmen who worked the phones and got generous commissions on trades of institutions and individuals." The brunt of the increased costs of trading was borne by investors who paid somewhere between $350 and $900 million for the experiment.


   Tick as a Movement Indicator  

The term tick can also be used to describe the direction of the price of a stock. An uptick indicates a trade where the transaction has occurred at a price higher than the previous transaction and a downtick indicates a transaction that has occurred at a lower price.



The uptick rule (eliminated by the SEC in 2007) was a trading restriction that prohibited short-selling except on an uptick, presumably to alleviate downward pressure on a stock when it is already declining.



The financial crisis that started the same year that the uptick rule was eliminated caused lawmakers to second-guess their decision. Instead of reviving the old rule, the SEC created an alternative uptick rule which restricted piling on a stock that has fallen more than 10% in a day.
What Is Tick Size?  

Tick size refers to the minimum price movement of a trading instrument in a market. The price movements of different trading instruments vary, with their tick sizes representing the minimum amount they can move up or down on an exchange.



In U.S. markets, the tick size increment is expressed in terms of dollars or cents. Stocks generally trade in one-cent tick size increments, while currencies have tick sizes in pips, and rates in basis points (bps).





Key Takeaways

Tick size is the minimum price increment change of a trading instrument.Tick sizes were once quoted in fractions (e.g., 1/16th of $1), but today are predominantly based on decimals and expressed in cents.For most stocks, the tick size is $0.01, but fractions of a cent may also occur. "Pips" and "bps" are also tick sizes used in currencies and fixed-income markets.


   How Is Tick Size Measured?  

In modern trading, tick sizes generally have a basis of decimals. Up until the early 2000s, however, U.S. stock markets expressed tick sizes based on fractions of a dollar. For most stocks, that fraction was one-sixteenth, so a tick size represented $0.0625, although some stocks had 1/8 (for thinly traded stocks) and some 1/32 tick sizes (for more active and liquid issues). This somewhat ungainly fraction tick size convention originated with the early New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), which first modeled its measurements on a centuries-old Spanish trading system that used a base of eight, or the number of fingers on a person’s two hands—minus the thumbs since they aren't considered fingers.



In 2005, the Securities and Exchange Commission introduced Rule 612, also known as the Sub-Penny Rule. Rule 612 requires the minimum tick size for stocks over $1.00 to be $0.01 while stocks under $1.00 can be quoted in increments of $0.0001. This process was known as decimalization. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) now requires all U.S. exchanges to effectively use hundredths, which is why the tick size today is $0.01, or one cent, for most stocks, though it has recently experimented with larger tick sizes for some less liquid stocks.



Futures markets typically have a tick size that is specific to the instrument, with $1 minimum tick sizes known as "points". For instance, one of the most heavily traded futures contracts is the S&P 500 E-mini. Its tick size is 0.25, or $12.50. That means if, say, the March 2021 contract’s current price is $2,553, and someone wanted to offer more for it, they would have to bid, at a minimum, $2,565.50. However, other index futures can move as little as $10, and some $5.


   Example of Tick Size  

On Oct. 3, 2016, the SEC started a two-year pilot program to test the potential benefits of larger tick sizes for stocks with closing prices of $2 or greater, market capitalizations of $3 billion or less, and consolidated average daily volume of 1 million shares or fewer. The Tick Size Pilot Program period ended on Sept. 28, 2018, although data collection and reporting requirements were set to continue for six more months.



The test collected data, including the profit margins of market makers in these securities. As part of the test, the SEC separated a sample of small-cap securities into one control group and two test groups. According to the SEC, each test group included about 400 securities, with the remainder placed in the control group.



The first group in the test used tick sizes of $0.05, although stocks in this group continued to trade at their current price increments. The second group also quoted tick sizes of $0.05, and traded them in these increments, although it included a small number of exceptions to this general rule.



The third group quoted in $0.05 increments, trades in $0.05 increments, though a rule prevented price matching by trading organizations that do not display the best price unless an exception applies. Securities in the control group continued to trade at $0.01 increments.


  Results of the Tick Size Pilot  

While it was merely a test, some retail brokers and traders criticized the study, arguing that a move to $0.05 tick sizes benefited market makers by potentially raising trading margins at the expense of individual investors. A white paper on the plan, “Tick Size Pilot Plan and Market Quality,” released in January 2018, found that stocks in the test groups experienced an increase in spreads and volatility and a decrease in price efficiency, relative to stocks in the control group.



The exchanges and FINRA submitted to the SEC a publicly available joint assessment of the impact of the Tick Size Pilot in July 2018.


   Pips and Forex Quotes  

Pips are the equivalent of 1/100, one basis point, or 0.01%. The foreign exchange (forex) market uses a four-decimal quoting convention utilizing pips for the tick size.



For example, the EUR/USD may have a 1.1257 bid. Some forex brokers also offer fractional pip pricing, which is to the fifth decimal place. For example, the above quote could be further specified as 1.12573. There are 10 factional pips to a whole pip, representing 1/10 the value of a full pip. The value of a pip varies based on the currency pair being traded.
What Is a Stock Ticker Symbol?  

A stock symbol or ticker is a unique series of letters assigned to a security for trading purposes. Stocks listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) can have four or fewer letters. Nasdaq-listed securities can have up to five characters.



Symbols are just a shorthand way of describing a company's stock, so there is no significant difference between those that have three letters and those that have four or five. Stock symbols are also known as ticker symbols.





Key Takeaways

A stock symbol is an arrangement of characters—usually letters—representing publicly-traded securities on an exchange.When a company issues securities to the public marketplace, it selects an available symbol for its shares, often related to the company name.Investors and traders use the symbol to place trade orders.Additional letters added to stock symbols denote additional characteristics such as share class or trading restrictions.


   Understanding Ticker Symbols  

In the 1800s, when modern stock exchanges came into being, floor traders had to communicate the stock price of a traded company by writing or shouting out the name of the company in full. As the number of publicly traded companies increased from the dozens to the hundreds, they soon realized that this process was time-consuming and held up the information queue, unable to keep up with frequently-changing prices—especially after the advent of the stock-quoting ticker tape machine in 1867.



To be more efficient in relaying price changes on company stock to investors, company names were shortened to one to five alpha symbols. Today, stock tickers still exist, but digital displays have replaced paper ticker tape.



In addition to saving time and capturing a specific stock price at the right time, stock symbols are useful when two or more companies have similar monikers. For example, Citigroup (C) and Citizens Financial Group (CFG) have similar names, although they are not affiliated with each other: Citigroup is a global bank and Citizens Financial Group is a bank holding company for Citizens Bank. Both firms trade on the NYSE, with Citigroup trading under the ticker C and Citizens Financial Group under CFG.



There are also companies that are spin-offs of the same company and have similar stock symbols. In November 2015, Hewlett-Packard split into two separate companies—Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) and HP Inc. (HPQ).



Hewlett Packard Enterprise serves as the business service and hardware division and focuses on servers, storage, networking, and security. HP Inc. is the consumer-facing computer and printer division and has a smaller market for its products than HPE.






Some companies that trade on the Nasdaq with fewer than four letters include Meta (META), formerly Facebook, and MoneyGram International (MGI). However, companies moving from the NYSE to Nasdaq can retain their stock symbols.


   Types of Ticker Symbols  
  Preferred Shares  

If the company has more than one class of shares trading in the market, then it will have the class added to its suffix. If it is a preferred stock, the letters "PR" and the letter denoting the class will typically be added. For example, a fictional preferred stock called Cory's Tequila Corporate Preferred A-shares would have a symbol such as CTC.PR.A. Different sources quote preferred shares in slightly different ways.


  Share Voting Class  

Some stock symbols indicate whether the shares of a company have voting rights, especially if the company has more than one class of shares trading in the market. For example, Alphabet Inc. (formerly Google) has two classes of shares trading on the Nasdaq with stock symbols GOOG and GOOGL. Common shareholders of GOOG have no voting rights since GOOG shares are Class C shares, while GOOGL shares are Class A shares and have one vote each. For example, Berkshire Hathaway has two classes of shares trading on the NYSE: Class A and Class B. Class A shares are listed with stock symbol BRK.A, and Class B shares, which have lower voting rights than Class A trade with the symbol BRK.B.



Other types of ticker sumbols include those designated for mutual funds or options listed on stocks.


  Stock Ticker Modifiers  

Stock symbols are also used to convey information to investors about the trading status of a company or its shares. This information is usually represented on the NYSE by one letter following a dot after the stock’s standard company symbol.



On the Nasdaq, a fifth letter is added to stocks that are delinquent in certain exchange requirements. For example, with ACERW, the first four letters comprised the stock symbol for Acer Therapeutics Inc. (ACER), and the last letter ‘W’ indicated that the shares had warrants attached. A company that is in bankruptcy proceedings will have the Q after its symbol, and a non-U.S. company trading in the U.S. financial markets will have the letter Y following its ticker symbol.



The meaning of the letters from A to Z are:



A: Class A shares (e.g., BRK.A)
B: Class B shares (e.g., BRK.B)
C: Issuer Qualification Exception—the company does not meet all the exchange’s listing requirements but can remain listed on the exchange for a short time period.
D: New issue of existing stock
E: Delinquent or missed one or more SEC required filings (may also be denoted by .LF)
F: Foreign issue
G: First convertible bond
H: Second convertible bond
I: Third convertible bond
J: Voting share
K: Non-voting share
L: Miscellaneous (e.g., foreign preferred, third-class of warrants, preferred when-issued, fifth class preferred shares, etc.)
M: Fourth-class preferred shares
N: Third-class preferred shares
O: Second-class preferred shares
P: First-class preferred shares
Q: In bankruptcy proceedings
R: Rights
S: Shares of beneficial interest
T: With warrants or with rights
U: Units
V: When-issued and when-distributed. These shares are about to go through a corporate action plan that has already been announced, such as a stock split.
W: Warrants
X: Mutual Funds
Y: American Depositary Receipt (ADR)
Z: Miscellaneous situations (same as the letter L)
OB: Over-the-counter bulletin board
PK: Pink sheets stock
SC: Nasdaq Small-cap
NM: Nasdaq National Market






Companies trading on the NYSE typically have three or fewer letters, although they can have four, representing their stock symbols. Nasdaq firms generally have four- or five-letter symbols (e.g., Adobe Inc. (ADBE), Apple Inc. (AAPL), and Groupon Inc. (GRPN)).


   History of Ticker Symbols  

The ticker symbol was invented by Edward Calahan, a telegraph operator who worked for the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). Calahan developed the ticker symbol in 1867 as a way to quickly and accurately transmit stock prices over telegraph lines. Calahan's ticker symbol consisted of two letters (representing the company's name) followed by a number representing the number of shares being traded. The ticker symbol was transmitted via telegraph and displayed on tickertape machines, which were used to keep track of stock prices in near real-time.



Calahan's invention revolutionized the way stock prices were reported and helped to make the stock market more efficient and transparent. Today, ticker symbols are used by most major stock exchanges around the world and are an important part of the financial industry.



The first ticker symbol was used by the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) on November 15, 1867, to identify the shares of the Union Pacific Railroad Company. The ticker symbol consisted of two letters (UP) followed by a number representing the number of shares being traded.



As the number of publicly traded companies and securities increased, the NYSE expanded the use of ticker symbols to include three letters in the 1920s and four letters in the 1950s. Today, ticker symbols are used by most major stock exchanges around the world and consist of up to five letters. In addition to identifying specific securities, ticker symbols have also become an important part of financial branding and marketing. Many companies choose ticker symbols that are easy to remember or have some connection to their business or brand.


   How to Use a Ticker Symbol  

Ticker symbols are used to identify specific publicly traded companies and the securities they issue. They are typically made up of one to five letters and are used to identify a specific stock or bond on a stock exchange or financial platform.



Here are some ways to use a ticker symbol:



Identify a specific security: Ticker symbols are used to identify a specific security, such as a stock or bond, on a financial platform or stock exchange. For example, the ticker symbol for Apple Inc. is "AAPL," while the ticker symbol for the S&P 500 index is "SPX."Track stock prices: Ticker symbols are often used to track stock prices in real-time on financial news websites and stock ticker boards.Place a trade: Ticker symbols are used in stock trading orders to identify the specific security being purchased or sold.Research a company: Ticker symbols can be used to find information about a specific company, such as its financial statements and news articles.



To use a ticker symbol, you will typically need to enter it into a financial platform or stock exchange's search function or use it in a trading order. Ticker symbols are typically displayed alongside a company's name and stock price on financial news websites, stock ticker boards, and other financial platforms.




How Do I Find a Company's Stock Ticker Symbol?
To find a company's ticker symbol, you can search online financial databases, check the company's website, check the stock exchange's website, or ask a financial advisor or broker.If you are having trouble finding a company's ticker symbol, it is possible that the company is not publicly traded or is listed on an exchange outside of the United States. In these cases, it may be more difficult to find the ticker symbol.




Why Is It Called a Ticker Symbol?
Stock symbols are called tickers because they first appeared as imprints on tickertape transmitted by telegraph from stock exchanges to investors around the country. This name persisted, even after physical tickertape was replaced by more modern technologies.




What Are Some Examples of Stock Tickers?
Here are some examples of popular ticker symbols:Apple Inc. (AAPL)Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL)Microsoft Corporation (MSFT)Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN)Meta (formerly Facebook) Inc. (META)Tesla Motors (TSLA)The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (GS)The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA)The S&P 500 Index (SPX)The NASDAQ Composite Index (COMP)


   The Bottom Line  

Stock ticker symbols are unique, alphabetic codes that are used to identify publicly traded companies and the securities they issue. They are typically made up of one to five letters and are used to identify a specific stock or bond on a stock exchange or financial platform. For example, the stock ticker symbol for Apple Inc. is "AAPL," while the ticker symbol for the S&P 500 index is "SPX." Ticker symbols are typically displayed alongside a company's name and stock price on financial news websites, stock ticker boards, and other financial platforms. They are also used in stock trading orders to identify the specific security being purchased or sold.
What Is Tier 1 Capital?  

Tier 1 capital refers to the core capital held in a bank's reserves and is used to fund business activities for the bank's clients. It includes common stock, as well as disclosed reserves and certain other assets. Along with Tier 2 capital, the size of a bank's Tier 1 capital reserves is used as a measure of the institution's financial strength.



Regulators require banks to hold certain levels of Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital as reserves, in order to ensure that they can absorb large losses without threatening the stability of the institution. Under the Basel III accord, the minimum Tier 1 capital ratio was set at 6% of a bank's risk-weighted assets.





Key Takeaways

Tier 1 capital refers to a bank's equity capital and disclosed reserves. It is used to measure the bank's capital adequacy.Tier 1 capital has two components: Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) and Additional Tier 1.The Basel III accord is the primary banking regulation that sets the minimum Tier 1 capital ratio requirement for financial institutions.The Tier 1 capital ratio compares a bank's equity capital with its total risk-weighted assets (RWAs). These are a compilation of assets the bank holds that are weighted by credit risk.Under the Basel III accord, the value of a bank's Tier 1 capital must be greater than 6% of its risk-weighted assets.An updated version of the accord, called Basel IV, began implementation in January 2023.

   Understanding Tier 1 Capital  

Tier 1 capital represents the core equity assets of a bank or financial institution. It is largely composed of disclosed reserves (also known as retained earnings) and common stock. It can also include noncumulative, nonredeemable preferred stock.



As defined by the Basel III standard, Tier 1 capital has two components: Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) and Additional Tier 1 capital (AT1). CET1 is the highest quality of capital, and can absorb losses immediately as they occur. This category includes common shares, retained earnings, accumulated other comprehensive income, and qualifying minority interest, minus certain regulatory adjustments and deductions.



Additional Tier 1 Capital includes noncumulative, nonredeemable preferred stock and related surplus, and qualifying minority interest. These instruments can also absorb losses, although they do not qualify for CET1.



The Tier 1 capital ratio compares a bank’s equity capital with its total risk-weighted assets (RWAs). RWAs are all assets held by a bank that are weighted by credit risk. Most central banks set formulas for asset risk weights according to the Basel Committee’s guidelines.






Tier 1 capital shouldn't be confused with Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital. Tier 1 includes CET1, as well as Additional Tier 1 capital.


   Tier 1 Capital vs. Tier 2 Capital  

In the Basel Accords, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision set the regulatory standards for Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital that must be reserved by any financial institution. Tier 2 capital has a lower standard than Tier 1, and is harder to liquidate. It includes hybrid capital instruments, loan-loss and revaluation reserves as well as undisclosed reserves.



The difference between Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital reserves relates to the purpose of those reserves. Tier 1 capital is described as "going concern" capital—that is, it is intended to absorb unexpected losses and allow the bank to continue operating as a going concern. Tier 2 capital is described as "gone concern" capital. In the event of a bank failure, these assets are used to defray the bank's obligations before depositors, lenders, and taxpayers are affected.






While the Basel agreements create a broad standard among international regulators, implementation will vary in each country.


   Changes to Tier 1 Capital Ratios  

The minimum requirements for Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital were set by the Basel Accords, a set of international regulatory agreements set by a committee of central banks and national bodies. Under the original Basel I agreement, the minimum ratio of capital to risk-weighted assets was set at 8%.



Following the 2007-8 financial crisis, the Basel Committee met again to address the weaknesses that the crisis had exposed in the banking system. The Basel III agreement, published in 2010, raised the capital requirements and introduced more-stringent disclosure requirements. It also introduced the distinction between Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital. Under the new guidelines, the minimum CET1 capital ratio was set at 4.5%, and the minimum Tier 1 capital ratio (CET1 + AT1) was set at 6%. The total amount of reserve capital (Tier 1 and Tier 2) must be over 8%.



These standards were further amended by the Basel IV standards in 2017, which started implementation in January 2023. The effects of the revised standards will vary, depending on each bank's business model.




How Do Banks Use Tier 1 Capital?
Tier 1 capital represents the strongest form of capital, consisting of shareholder equity, disclosed reserves, and certain other income. Under the Basel III standards, banks must maintain the equivalent of 6% of their risk-weighted assets in Tier 1 capital. This allows them to absorb unexpected losses and continue operating as a going concern.




What Is the Difference Between Tier 1 Capital and Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) Capital?
CET1 is the main component of Tier 1 capital. It represents the strongest form of capital, which can be quickly liquidated to absorb unexpected losses. It comprises common stock and stock surplus, retained earnings, qualifying minority interest, and certain other income. Tier 1 includes CET1, as well as certain other instruments, such as preferred stock and related surplus.




What Are the Major Changes Between Basel III and Basel IV?
The Basel IV standards are a set of recommendations to financial regulators that were adopted in 2017 and started to take effect in January 2023. These recommendations fine-tune the calculations of credit risk, market risk, and operations risk. They also enhance the leverage ratio framework for certain banks, and other reforms.


   The Bottom Line  

Tier 1 capital is the core capital held in a bank's reserves, and is used to fund business activities for clients. It comprises common stock, as well as disclosed reserves and certain other assets. Along with Tier 2 capital, the size of a bank's Tier 1 capital reserves is used as a measure of the institution's financial strength and a globally recognized standard to gauge banks' health. Under the Basel III accord, the value of a bank's Tier 1 capital must be greater than 6% of its risk-weighted assets.
What Is the Tier 1 Capital Ratio?  

The tier 1 capital ratio is the ratio of a bank’s core tier 1 capital—that is, its equity capital and disclosed reserves—to its total risk-weighted assets. It is a key measure of a bank's financial strength that has been adopted as part of the Basel III Accord on bank regulation.



The tier 1 capital ratio measures a bank’s core equity capital against its total risk-weighted assets—which include all the assets the bank holds that are systematically weighted for credit risk. For example, a bank’s cash on hand and government securities would receive a weighting of 0%, while its mortgage loans would be assigned a 50% weighting.



Tier 1 capital is core capital and is comprised of a bank's common stock, retained earnings, accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI), noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and any regulatory adjustments to those accounts.

   What Does the Tier 1 Capital Ratio Tell You?  

The tier 1 capital ratio is the basis for the Basel III international capital and liquidity standards devised after the financial crisis, in 2010. The crisis showed that many banks had too little capital to absorb losses or remain liquid, and were funded with too much debt and not enough equity.



To force banks to increase capital buffers, and ensure they can withstand financial distress before they become insolvent, Basel III rules would tighten both tier 1 capital and risk-weighted assets (RWAs). The equity component of tier-1 capital has to have at least 4.5% of RWAs. The tier 1 capital ratio has to be at least 6%.



Basel III also introduced a minimum leverage ratio—with tier 1 capital, it must be at least 3% of the total assets—and more for global systemically important banks that are too big to fail. The Basel III rules have yet to be finalized due to an impasse between the U.S. and Europe.



A firm's risk-weighted assets include all assets that the firm holds that are systematically weighted for credit risk. Central banks typically develop the weighting scale for different asset classes; cash and government securities carry zero risk, while a mortgage loan or car loan would carry more risk. The risk-weighted assets would be assigned an increasing weight according to their credit risk. Cash would have a weight of 0%, while loans of increasing credit risk would carry weights of 20%, 50% or 100%.



The tier 1 capital ratio differs slightly from the tier 1 common capital ratio. Tier 1 capital includes the sum of a bank's equity capital, its disclosed reserves, and non-redeemable, non-cumulative preferred stock. Tier 1 common capital, however, excludes all types of preferred stock as well as non-controlling interests. Tier 1 common capital includes the firm's common stock, retained earnings and other comprehensive income.


   Example of the Tier 1 Capital Ratio  

For example, assume that bank ABC has shareholders' equity of $3 million and retained earnings of $2 million, so its tier 1 capital is $5 million. Bank ABC has risk-weighted assets of $50 million. Consequently, its tier 1 capital ratio is 10% ($5 million/$50 million), and it is considered to be well-capitalized compared to the minimum requirement.



On the other hand, bank DEF has retained earnings of $600,000 and stockholders' equity of $400,000. Thus, its tier 1 capital is $1 million. Bank DEF has risk-weighted assets of $25 million. Therefore, bank DEF's tier 1 capital ratio is 4% ($1 million/$25 million), which is undercapitalized because it is below the minimum tier 1 capital ratio under Basel III.



Bank GHI has tier 1 capital of $5 million and risk-weighted assets of $83.33 million. Consequently, bank GHI's tier 1 capital ratio is 6% ($5 million/$83.33 million), which is considered to be adequately capitalized because it is equal to the minimum tier 1 capital ratio.


   The Difference Between the Tier 1 Capital Ratio and the Tier 1 Leverage Ratio  

The tier 1 leverage ratio is the relationship between a banking organization's core capital and its total assets. The tier 1 leverage ratio is calculated by dividing tier 1 capital by a bank's average total consolidated assets and certain off-balance sheet exposures. Similarly to the tier 1 capital ratio, the tier 1 leverage ratio is used as a tool by central monetary authorities to ensure the capital adequacy of banks and to place constraints on the degree to which a financial company can leverage its capital base but does not use risk-weighted assets in the denominator.
What Is the Tier 1 Common Capital Ratio?  

Tier 1 common capital ratio is a measurement of a bank's core equity capital, compared with its total risk-weighted assets, and signifies a bank's financial strength. The Tier 1 common capital ratio is utilized by regulators and investors because it shows how well a bank can withstand financial stress and remain solvent. Tier 1 common capital excludes any preferred shares or non-controlling interests, which makes it differ from the closely-related tier 1 capital ratio.

   What Does the Tier 1 Common Capital Ratio Tell You?  

A firm's risk-weighted assets include all assets that the firm holds that are systematically weighted for credit risk. Central banks typically develop the weighting scale for different asset classes; cash and government securities carry zero risk, while a mortgage loan or car loan would carry more risk. The risk-weighted assets would be assigned an increasing weight according to their credit risk. Cash would have a weight of 0%, while loans of increasing credit risk would carry weights of 20%, 50%, or 100%.



Regulators use the Tier 1 common capital ratio to grade a firm's capital adequacy as one of the following: well-capitalized, adequately capitalized, undercapitalized, significantly undercapitalized or critically undercapitalized. To be classified as well-capitalized, a firm must have a Tier 1 common capital ratio of 7% or greater, and not pay any dividends or distributions that would reduce that ratio below 7%.



A firm characterized as a systemically important financial institution (SIFI) is subject to an additional 3% cushion for its Tier 1 common capital ratio, making its threshold to be considered well-capitalized at 10%. Firms not considered well-capitalized are subject to restrictions on paying dividends and share buybacks.



The Tier 1 common capital ratio differs from the closely-related Tier 1 capital ratio. Tier 1 capital includes the sum of a bank's equity capital, its disclosed reserves, and non-redeemable, non-cumulative preferred stock. Tier 1 common capital, however, excludes all types of preferred stock as well as non-controlling interests. Tier 1 common capital includes the firm's common stock, retained earnings and other comprehensive income.



Bank investors pay attention to the Tier 1 common capital ratio because it foreshadows whether a bank has not only the means to pay dividends and buy back shares but also the permission to do so from regulators. The Federal Reserve assesses a bank's Tier 1 common capital ratio during stress tests to discern whether a bank can withstand economic shocks and market volatility.


   Example of the Tier 1 Common Capital Ratio  

As an example, assume a bank has $100 billion of risk-weighted assets after assigning the corresponding weights for its cash, credit lines, mortgages and personal loans. Its Tier 1 common capital includes $4 billion of common stock and $4 billion of retained earnings, leading to total Tier 1 common capital of $8 billion. The company also issued $500 million in preferred shares. Dividing the Tier 1 common capital of $8 billion less the $500 in preferreds by total risk-weighted assets of $100 billion yields a Tier 1 common capital ratio of 7.5%.



If we were instead computing the standard tier 1 capital ratio, it would be calculated as 8% since it would include the preferred shares.
What Is the Tier 1 Leverage Ratio?  

The Tier 1 leverage ratio measures a bank's core capital relative to its total assets. The ratio looks specifically at Tier 1 capital to judge how leveraged a bank is based on its assets. Tier 1 capital refers to those assets that can be easily liquidated if a bank needs capital in the event of a financial crisis. The Tier 1 leverage ratio is thus a measure of a bank's near-term financial health.



The Tier 1 leverage ratio is frequently used by regulators to ensure the capital adequacy of banks and to place constraints on the degree to which a financial company can leverage its capital base.





Key Takeaways

The Tier 1 leverage ratio compares a bank's Tier 1 capital to its total assets to evaluate how leveraged a bank is.The Tier 1 ratio is employed by bank regulators to ensure that banks have enough liquidity on hand to meet certain requisite stress tests.A ratio above 5% is deemed to be an indicator of strong financial footing for a bank.

   How to Calculate the Tier 1 Leverage Ratio  

Tier 1 capital for the bank is placed in the numerator of the leverage ratio. Tier 1 capital represents a bank's common equity, retained earnings, reserves, and certain instruments with discretionary dividends and no maturity.The bank's total consolidated assets for the period are placed in the denominator of the formula, which is typically reported on a bank's quarterly or annual earnings report.Divide the bank's Tier 1 capital by total consolidated assets to arrive at the Tier 1 leverage ratio. Multiply the result by 100 to convert the number to a percentage.


   What Does the Tier 1 Leverage Ratio Tell You?  

The Tier 1 leverage ratio was introduced by the Basel III accords, an international regulatory banking treaty proposed by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision in 2009. The ratio uses Tier 1 capital to evaluate how leveraged a bank is in relation to its overall assets. The higher the Tier 1 leverage ratio is, the higher the likelihood that the bank could withstand a negative shock to its balance sheet.

Tier 1 capital is the core capital of a bank according to Basel III and consists of the most stable and liquid capital as well as the most effective at absorbing losses during a financial crisis or downturn.



The denominator in the Tier 1 leverage ratio is a bank's total exposures, which include its consolidated assets, derivative exposure, and certain off-balance sheet exposures. Basel III required banks to include off-balance-sheet exposures, such as commitments to provide loans to third parties, standby letters of credit (SLOC), acceptances, and trade letters of credit.


  Tier 1 Leverage Ratio Requirements  

Basel III established a 3% minimum requirement for the Tier 1 leverage ratio, while it left open the possibility of increasing that threshold for certain systematically important financial institutions.



In 2014, the Federal Reserve, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC), and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) released regulatory capital rules that imposed higher leverage ratios for banks of certain sizes effective as of Jan. 1, 2018. Bank holding companies with more than $700 billion in consolidated total assets or more than $10 trillion in assets under management must maintain an additional 2% buffer, making their minimum Tier 1 leverage ratios 5%.



In addition, if an insured depository institution is being covered by a corrective action framework, meaning it demonstrated capital deficiencies in the past, it must demonstrate at least a 6% Tier 1 leverage ratio to be considered well-capitalized.


   Real-World Example of the Tier 1 Leverage Ratio  

Below are the capital ratios taken from the financial statements of Bank of America Corporation (BAC) as reported in the bank's Q3 earnings report on Oct. 31, 2018.

Highlighted in yellow at the bottom of the table, a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 8.3% for the period was reported by the bank.
We can calculate the ratio by taking the total Tier 1 capital of $186,189 billion (highlighted in green) and dividing it by the bank's total assets of $2.240 trillion (highlighted in blue).
The calculation is as follows:

   The Difference Between the Tier 1 Leverage Ratio and the Tier 1 Capital Ratio  

The Tier 1 capital ratio is the ratio of a bank’s core Tier 1 capital—that is, its equity capital and disclosed reserves—to its total risk-weighted assets. It is a key measure of a bank's financial strength that has been adopted as part of the Basel III Accord on bank regulation.



The Tier 1 capital ratio measures a bank’s core equity capital against its total risk-weighted assets, which include all the assets the bank holds that are systematically weighted for credit risk. The Tier 1 leverage ratio measures a bank's core capital to its total assets. The ratio uses Tier 1 capital to judge how leveraged a bank is in relation to its consolidated assets, whereas the Tier 1 capital ratio measures the bank's core capital against its risk-weighted assets.


   Limitations of Using the Tier 1 Leverage Ratio  

A limitation of using the Tier 1 leverage ratio is that investors are reliant on banks to properly and honestly calculate and report their Tier 1 capital and total assets figures. If a bank doesn't report or calculate its figures properly, the leverage ratio could be inaccurate. A leverage ratio above 5% is currently what regulators are looking for, but we won't actually know until the next financial crisis hits to find out whether banks are truly able to withstand the financial shock that it causes.




What Is the Tier 1 Leverage Ratio of Major Banks?
A tier 1 leverage ratio above 5% is considered to be an indicator of strong financial health for a bank. Most major banks have a ratio well above 5%- Here are some examples as of Q1 2023:Citibank: 8.82 JPMorgan Chase: 8.60Wells Fargo: 8.55Bank of America: 7.88




What Is the Minimum Tier 1 Capital Ratio for a Bank?
Under the Basel Accords, banks must have a minimum capital ratio of 8% of which 6% must be Tier 1 capital. The 6% Tier 1 ratio must be composed of at least 4.5% of Common Equity Tier (CET1).




What Is the Difference Between CET1 and Tier 1 Leverage Ratio?
Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) is a component of Tier 1 capital that is primarily liquid bank holdings such as cash and stock. The CET1 ratio compares a bank's capital against its assets. The other component of Tier 1 capital is known as additional Tier 1 capital (AT1) and is composed of instruments that are not common equity. In other words, AT1 + CET1 = Tier 1 capital.


   The Bottom Line  

The tier 1 leverage ratio is the relationship between a banking organization's core capital and its total assets. It's calculated by dividing tier 1 capital by a bank's average total consolidated assets. It serves as a measure of a bank's financial strength. Regulators look for a tier 1 leverage ratio above 5% to ensure that a bank is well-capitalized and has enough liquidity on hand to meet its financial obligations.
What Is Tier 2 Capital?  

The term tier 2 capital refers to one of the components of a bank's required reserves. Tier 2 is designated as the second or supplementary layer of a bank's capital and is composed of items such as revaluation reserves, hybrid instruments, and subordinated term debt. It is considered less secure than Tier 1 capital—the other form of a bank's capital—because it's more difficult to liquidate. In the United States, the overall capital requirement is partially based on the weighted risk of a bank's assets.





Key Takeaways

Tier 2 capital is the second layer of capital that a bank must keep as part of its required reserves.This tier is comprised of revaluation reserves, general provisions, subordinated term debt, and hybrid capital instruments.There are two levels of Tier 2 capital—upper level and lower level capital. Tier 2 capital is subordinate to Tier 1 capital and is considered riskier as it is more difficult to calculate if a bank needs to liquidate it.


   Understanding Tier 2 Capital  

Bank capital requirements were designated as part of the international Basel Accords. This set of recommendations was developed by the Basel Committee on Bank Supervision over a number of years dating back to the 1980s. According to the regulations, banks must maintain a certain amount of cash and/or other forms of liquid assets on hand in order to meet their obligations. No more than 25% of a bank's capital requirements can be comprised of Tier 2 capital.



Bank capital is divided into two layers—Tier 1 or core capital and Tier 2 or supplementary capital. A bank's capital ratio is calculated by dividing its capital by its total risk-based assets. The minimum capital ratio reserve requirement for a bank is set at 8%—6% of which must be provided by Tier 1 capital. The remaining must be Tier 2 capital. Along with Tier 1 capital, it provides a bank with a financial cushion in case it needs to liquidate its assets.



There are four components of Tier 2 capital. These include:



Revaluation reserves: These are reserves created by the revaluation of an asset. A typical revaluation reserve is a building owned by a bank. Over time, the value of the real estate asset tends to increase and can thus be revalued.
General provisions: This category consists of losses that a bank may have of an as yet undetermined amount including from loans. The total general provision amount allowed is 1.25% of the bank's risk-weighted assets (RWA).
Hybrid capital instruments: This type of capital is a mixture of both debt and equity instruments. Preferred stock is an example of a hybrid instrument. A bank may include hybrid instruments in its Tier 2 capital as long as the assets are sufficiently similar to equity so losses can be taken on the face value of the instrument without triggering the liquidation of the bank.
Subordinated debt: Debt is subordinated in regard to ordinary bank depositors and other loans and securities that constitute higher-ranking senior debt. The minimum original term of this debt is over five years.



Tier 2 capital is split into upper and lower levels. Upper-level Tier 2 capital consists of securities that are perpetual—meaning they have no maturity date—revaluation reserves, and fixed asset investments. Lower-level Tier 2 capital consists of subordinated debt and is generally inexpensive for a bank to issue.


   Special Considerations  

Undisclosed reserves may be counted as part of a bank's Tier 2 capital in certain countries. These reserves are profits a bank earns that don't appear on publicly-available documents such as a bank's balance sheet. Despite not being disclosed, most banks still consider these reserves to be real assets.



Regulatory authorities in some countries recognize their banks' undisclosed reserves as part of Tier 2 capital. Most countries, including the United States, do not allow this kind of capital to be used to legitimately meet reserve requirements.






Most countries, including the United States, do not allow undisclosed reserves to be used to meet reserve requirements.﻿﻿


   Tier 2 Capital vs. Tier 1 Capital  

As mentioned above, a bank's capital reserves are divided into tiers. Unlike Tier 2 capital, Tier 1 capital is a bank's core capital or the primary source of funding for a bank. As such, it consists of almost all of an institution's funds including all of its disclosed reserves and any equity capital like common stock. This capital helps a bank absorb any losses so it can continue its day-to-day operations. Because this level is composed of a bank's core capital, Tier 1 is a very good indicator of its financial health. This tier is considered more reliable than Tier 2 capital. That's because the capital is much easier to calculate accurately. The assets that fall into this category are also much easier to liquidate.




What Is Tier 3 Capital?
Tier 3 capital is tertiary capital banks use to support market risk in their trading activities. Tier 3 capital includes a greater variety of debt (short-term unsecured, subordinated debt) than tier 1 and tier 2 capital, but it's of lower quality. Tier 3 capital is being abolished under the Basel III accords.




What Is Basel II?
Basel II is the second of the three Basel Accords, aimed to create international standards for bank regulation and reduce risk in the banking system. It built upon Basel I, clarifying some of its rules and adding new ones. Basel II led to Basel III, which aims to address the inadequacies of the two earlier accords.




What Is the Minimum Capital Adequacy Under Basel II?
Under Basell II, banks are required to maintain a capital reserve (Tier 1 + 2 + 3) equal to at least 8% of their risk-weighted assets.


   The Bottom Line  

Banking regulations known as the Basel Accords require banks to hold different types of capital on hand and certain percentages of each. Having these types of liquid assets or cash balances out the risk-weighted assets that banks hold and increases the stability of the financial system.



Tier 2 capital is the supplementary capital held in reserve by a bank. It is less reliable than tier 1 capital because it's composed of assets that are difficult to liquidate, and it's more difficult to measure accurately.
What Is Tight Monetary Policy?  

Tight, or contractionary monetary policy is a course of action undertaken by a central bank such as the Federal Reserve to slow down overheated economic growth, to constrict spending in an economy that is seen to be accelerating too quickly, or to curb inflation when it is rising too fast.



The central bank tightens policy or makes money tight by raising short-term interest rates through policy changes to the discount rate and federal funds rate. Boosting interest rates increases the cost of borrowing and effectively reduces its attractiveness. Tight monetary policy can also be implemented via selling assets on the central bank's balance sheet to the market through open market operations (OMO).





Key Takeaways

Tight monetary policy is an action undertaken by a central bank such as the Federal Reserve to slow down overheated economic growth.Central banks engage in tight monetary policy when an economy is accelerating too quickly or inflation—overall prices—is rising too fast.Hiking the federal funds rate–the rate at which banks lend to each other–increases borrowing rates and slows lending.

   Understanding Tight Monetary Policy  

Central banks around the world use monetary policy to regulate specific factors within the economy. Central banks most often use the federal funds rate as a leading tool for regulating market factors.



The federal funds rate is used as a base rate throughout global economies. It refers to the rate at which banks lend to each other. An increase in the federal funds rate is followed by increases in the borrowing rates throughout the economy.



Rate increases make borrowing less attractive as interest payments increase. It affects all types of borrowing including personal loans, mortgages, and interest rates on credit cards. An increase in rates also makes saving more attractive, as savings rates also increase in an environment with a tightening policy.



The Fed may also raise reserve requirements for member banks, in a bid to shrink the money supply or perform open-market operations, by selling assets like U.S. Treasuries, to large investors. This large number of sales lowers the market price of such assets and increases their yields, making it more economical for savers and bondholders.






On Aug. 27, 2020, the Federal Reserve announced that it will no longer raise interest rates due to unemployment falling below a certain level of inflation. It also changed its inflation target to an average, meaning that it will allow inflation to rise somewhat above its 2% target to make up for periods when it was below 2%.



Tight monetary policy is different from—but can be coordinated with—a tight fiscal policy, which is enacted by legislative bodies and includes raising taxes or decreasing government spending. When the Fed lowers rates and makes the environment easier to borrow it is called monetary easing.


   A Benefit of Tight Monetary Policy: Open Market Treasury Sales  

In a tightening policy environment, the Fed can also sell Treasuries on the open market in order to absorb some extra capital during a tightened monetary policy environment. This effectively takes capital out of the open markets as the Fed takes in funds from the sale with the promise of paying the amount back with interest.






Tightening policy occurs when central banks raise the federal funds rate, and easing occurs when central banks lower the federal funds rate.



In a tightening monetary policy environment, a reduction in the money supply is a factor that can significantly help to slow or keep the domestic currency from inflation. The Fed often looks at tightening monetary policy during times of strong economic growth.



An easing monetary policy environment serves the opposite purpose. In an easing policy environment, the central bank lowers rates to stimulate growth in the economy. Lower rates lead consumers to borrow more, also effectively increasing the money supply.



Many global economies have lowered their federal funds' rates to zero, and some global economies are in negative rate environments. Both zero and negative-rate environments benefit the economy through easier borrowing. In an extreme negative rate environment, borrowers even receive interest payments, which can create a significant demand for credit.




What Are the 3 Main Monetary Tools of the Federal Reserve?
The Federal Reserve's three primary monetary tools are reserve requirements, the discount rate, and open market operations. The reserve requirement stipulates the amount of reserves that member banks must have on hand, the discount rate is the rate at which banks can borrow from the Federal Reserve, and open market operations is the Fed's buying or selling of U.S. Treasuries.




What Are Tight and Loose Monetary Policy?
Tight monetary policy is a central bank's efforts to contract a growing economy by increasing interest rates, increasing the reserve requirement for banks, and selling U.S. Treasuries. Conversely, a loose monetary policy is one that seeks to expand or grow an economy, which is done by lowering interest rates, lowering the reserve requirements for banks, and buying U.S. Treasuries.




What Is Monetary Policy?
Monetary policy is the actions that a nation's central bank takes to control the money supply in an economy with the goal of helping grow a slowing economy or to contract an economy that is growing too fast.
What Is a Timber Investment Management Organization (TIMO)?  

A Timber Investment Management Organization (TIMO) is a management group that aids institutional investors in managing their timberland investment portfolios. A TIMO acts as a broker for institutional clients to find, analyze and acquire investment properties that would best suit their clients.



Similar to some REITs, once an investment property is chosen, the TIMO is given the responsibility of actively managing the timberland to achieve adequate returns for the investors.





Key Takeaways

Institutional investors looking to invest in timber and timberland often use timber investment management organizations (TIMOs).TIMOs serve as middlemen that research and acquire timber investments and subsequently manage those investments on behalf of clients.Timber is often seen as a good portfolio diversifier that can hedge against inflation.


   Understanding Timber Investment Management Organizations (TIMOs)  

TIMOs developed in the 1970s after Congress passed legislation called the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, which encouraged institutional investors to diversify their portfolios. Before the legislation, investment in timberland properties was made chiefly by both large and small firms in the forestry industry. By 2007, a study by the Realtors Land Institute (RLI) showed that approximately $60 billion in the land was managed by TIMOs.



Initially, TIMOs were viewed positively by forest conservationists, who felt separating the owners of forest lands from the wood mills that use the lumber was a good idea. Later, conservationists came to understand the TIMOs were not looking to maximize the conservation of America's forest lands. Instead, TIMOs are focused on maximizing the financial return for investors. According to a study published by the Pinchot Institute for Conservation, private forest lands are being converted for development at a rate of 6,000 acres per day.



Forisk Consulting tracks the largest TIMOs in the United States. The table below lists the 2021 top 10 U.S. timberland owners by acreage and compares this to their prior-year rankings. TIMOs hold six of the top ten positions.















Top 10 Timberland Owners in US and Canada (2021).


   Why Invest in Timberland?  

According to RLI, timberland returns have compared favorably with stocks but with much less risk and volatility. Others say timberland returns have varied over time as the industry has matured.



Returns were negative for a year after the financial crisis of 2008, but have since been increasing. U.S. timberland investment performance is measured by the NCREIF Timberland Property Index. According to NCREIF, investment returns from U.S. timberland between Q2 2020 and Q2 2021 was just 1.46% compared to 18.4% earned by the S&P 500 in 2020. One year's performance is not enough to accurately measure long-term investment performance, but this data serves to demonstrate how annual returns differ for various asset classes.



It is true that TIMOs can help institutional investors diversify their portfolios into U.S. timberlands, but such real estate investments are probably best used as part of a well-diversified portfolio with multiple asset classes, such as stocks, bonds, and commodities.



In addition to wealth-building opportunities created by market changes, there are a number of other reasons to consider adding timber to a portfolio.



The demand for timber is increasing. As of 2008, the demand for timber has been increasing as forest-related product development grows. Even paper recycling efforts have had little effect on demand, and according to the Society Of American Foresters, every American consumes a 100 ft. tree each year.
Timber is an inflation hedge. Timber increases in value "on the stump" at a greater rate than inflation. According to legendary investor Jeremy Grantham, timber prices in the last century (~1905-2005) have also grown at a rate that is approximately 3% greater than inflation.
Timber returns beat stocks. Measuring returns using the National Council of Real Estate Investment Fiduciaries (NCREIF) Timberland Index, timber investment returns exceeded those of the S&P 500 from 1990 through 2007. In that period of time, the NCREIF Timberland Index annual compounded return was 12.88% versus 10.54% for the S&P 500 index. This excess in return was also provided with less volatility as shown by the Sharpe ratios for the same period (1.06 for timber, versus .45 for the S&P 500), underscoring the risk/return benefits of timber over the overall stock market.
Timber has a low correlation to other asset classes. Commercial timberland prices are impacted by a different set of market and economic factors than other asset classes. Because prices are not affected by the same factors, timber returns are not correlated to returns of other asset classes, such as stocks, bonds, and real estate. The addition of a low correlation timberland asset will increase the diversification of an investment portfolio. The NCREIF Timberland Index returns from 1990 through 2007 showed a moderate to weak correlation against equity and fixed-income indexes and a negative correlation to real estate.
Investment in the land as an appreciating asset.Although the land necessary to grow timber stock can be leased, the majority of timber investors purchase the land. The land supply is limited and demand continues to grow as the population and commercial development expands. Depending on location, some property can be targeted as "higher and better use" land that can be sold to developers at a premium, providing additional appreciation benefits for timber owners. The collapse of markets that require timber as inputs looms as a potential risk. However, timberland is a natural warehouse where stock can be stored on the stump until markets and demand rebound. While natural disasters, such as unfavorable weather and fire can also reduce stock, even events such as the Mount St. Helens eruption in 1980 did not wipe out investors. Damaged stock was still valuable and was sold to lumber and paper companies, then replanted for future profit.
What Is Time Decay?  

Time decay is a measure of the rate of decline in the value of an options contract due to the passage of time. Time decay accelerates as an option's time to expiration draws closer since there's less time to realize a profit from the trade.





Key Takeaways

Time decay is the rate of change in value to an option's price as it nears expiration.Depending on whether an option is in-the-money (ITM), time decay accelerates in the last month before expiration.The more time left until expiry, the slower the time decay while the closer to expiry, the more time decay increases. 






   How Time Decay Works  

Time decay is the reduction in the value of an option as the time to the expiration date approaches. An option's time value is how much time plays into the value—or the premium—for the option. The time value declines or time decay accelerates as the expiration date gets closer because there's less time for an investor to earn a profit from the option.












Image by Sabrina Jiang © Investopedia 2020



This figure, when calculated, will always be negative, as time only moves in one direction. The countdown for time decay begins as soon as the option is initially bought and continues until expiration.






Time decay is also called theta and is known as one of the options Greeks. Other Greeks include delta, gamma, vega, and rho, and these formulas help you assess the risks inherent with an options trade.


   Special Considerations  

To understand how time decay impacts an option, we must first review what makes up the value of an option. Options contracts give investors the right to buy or sell securities, such as stocks, at a specific price and time. The strike price is the price at which the options contract changes to shares of the underlying security if the option is exercised.



Each option has a premium attached to it, which is the value and often the cost of purchasing the option. However, there are a few other components that also drive the value of the premium. These factors include intrinsic value, extrinsic value, interest rate changes, and the volatility the underlying asset may exhibit.


  Intrinsic Value  

Intrinsic value is the difference between the market price of the underlying security—such as a stock—and the strike price of the option. A call option with a strike price of $20, while the underlying stock is trading at $20, would have no intrinsic value since there's no profit. 



However, a call option with a strike price of $20, while the underlying stock is trading at $30, would have a $10 intrinsic value. In other words, the intrinsic value is the minimum profit that's built into the option given the prevailing market price and the strike. Of course, the intrinsic value can change as the stock's price fluctuates, but the strike price remains fixed throughout the contract. 


  Extrinsic Value  

The extrinsic value is more abstract than the intrinsic value, and it's more difficult to measure. The extrinsic value of options factors in the amount of time left before expiration and the rate of time decay leading up to the expiry. If an investor buys a call option with a few months until expiry, the option will have a greater value than an option that expires in a few days. 



The time value of an option with little time left until expiry is less since there's a lower probability of an investor making money by buying the option. As a result, the option's price or premium declines. 



The option with a few months until expiry will have an increased amount of time value and slow time decay since there's a reasonable probability that an option buyer could earn a profit. However, as time passes and the option isn't yet profitable, time decay accelerates, particularly in the last 30 days before expiration. As a result, the option's value declines as the expiry approaches, and more so if it's not yet profitable.


   Time Decay vs. Moneyness  

Moneyness is the level of profitability of an option as measured by its intrinsic value. If the option is in-the-money (ITM) or profitable, it will retain some of its value as the expiration approaches since the profit is already built-in and time is less of a factor.



The option would have intrinsic value, while time decay would increase at a slower rate. However, time decay and the time value of an option are extremely important for investors to consider because they are key factors in determining the likelihood that the option will be profitable. 



Time decay is prevalent with at-the-money (ATM) options since there's no intrinsic value. In other words, the premium for an ATM option mostly consists of time value. If the option is out-of-the-money (OTM)—or not profitable—time decay increases at a faster rate. This acceleration is because as more time passes, the option becomes less and less likely to become in the money.



The loss of time value happens even if the value of the underlying asset has not changed during the same period. Another way to look at options contracts is that they are wasting assets meaning their value declines or depreciates over time.



Essentially, investors are buying options that have the greatest probability of making a profit by expiry and how much time is left determines the price investors are willing to pay for the option. In short, the more time left until expiry, the slower the time decay while the closer to expiry, the more time decay increases.


   Advantages and Disadvantages of Time Decay  



Pros

Time decay is slow early in an option's life, adding to its value or premium.
When time decay is slow, investors can sell the option while it still has value.
Time decay's impact on an option's premium helps investors determine whether it's worth pursuing.



Cons

Time decay accelerates as an option's time to expiration draws closer.
Measuring the rate of change in time decay of an option can be difficult.
Time decay occurs regardless of whether the underlying asset's price has risen or fallen.





   Example of Time Decay  

An investor is looking to buy a call option with a strike price of $20 and a premium of $2 per contract. The investor expects the stock to be at $22 or higher at expiration in two months.



However, a contract with the same strike of $20 that's has only a week left until expiration has a premium of 50 cents per contract. The contract costs far less than the $2 contract since it's unlikely the stock will move higher by 10% or more in a few days.



In other words, the extrinsic value of the second option is lower than the first option with two months left until expiration.
What Is a Time Deposit?  

A time deposit is an interest-bearing bank account that has a pre-set date of maturity. A certificate of deposit (CD) is the best-known example. The money must remain in the account for the fixed term in order to earn the stated interest rate.



Time deposits generally pay a slightly higher rate of interest than a regular savings account. The longer the time to maturity, the higher the interest payment will be.



Another name for this type of investment is term deposit.


   Time Deposits Explained  

A time deposit such as a CD can be purchased at virtually any bank, credit union, or other financial institution. The interest rates paid vary, as do other terms. For example, one bank may offer a higher return but require a larger deposit.



It pays to shop around. Most post their rates prominently and advertise them widely.



A CD is essentially a savings account that is opened with the promise that the owner won't touch the money for a set period of time. This can range from a few months to years. A term of a year or less is considered a short-term time deposit. Anything over that is a long-term deposit.


  Penalties on Early Withdrawals  

The owner of a time deposit can withdraw the money out if necessary but will lose some or all of the promised interest and may pay penalty fees. The terms are in the fine print that the saver receives when opening the account.



A customer can earn a slightly higher interest rate with a time deposit account than would be available in a standard savings account or an interest-bearing checking account. The better return is offered because the funds remain locked until the maturity date of the account.



Time deposits are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) up to $250,000 per investment. Those opened at a credit union carry protection from the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA).





Key Takeaways

A time deposit is an interest-bearing bank account that has a date of maturity, such as a certificate of deposit (CD).The money in a time deposit must be held for the fixed term to receive the interest in full.Typically, the longer the term, the higher the interest rate that the depositor receives.Time deposits are an extremely safe investment but they have a low rate of return.


  Why Banks Offer Time Deposit Accounts  

Time deposit accounts provide banks with the cash flow they need to lend money to other customers. The bank makes a profit by lending the funds held in time deposit accounts for a higher interest rate than the rate it pays on the time deposits.



The bank may also invest the money from the time deposit in other securities that pay a higher return than it is paying the customer.


  Some Options on Time Deposits  

Banks and other financial institutions may accept any maturity term that a customer requests, as long as it is a minimum of 30 days.



Once the investment matures, the funds can be withdrawn without penalty. Or, the investor may choose to renew the time deposit account for another term. For example, a one-year CD could be rolled over into another one-year CD.


  Longer Terms Earn Higher Interest  

Typically, the longer the term to maturity, the higher the interest rate paid to the depositor. For example, a one-year CD may offer a 1.10% annual percentage yield (APY), while a five-year CD for the same amount might provide a 1.75% APY. The annual percentage yield is the effective annual rate of return (RoR) taking into account the effect of compounding interest. 



Generally, two rates are quoted for time deposits and CDs:



The interest rate is the percentage interest that the customer would earn if the customer withdrew the interest amount received each month.The annual percentage yield (APY) is the amount that the customer will earn if the interest is allowed to remain in the account and compound.



The APY is, therefore, higher than the quoted interest rate.


  The Downside of Time Deposits  

As with most financial products, there are advantages and disadvantages to time deposit accounts. Above all, they are a safe place to put your money and they're a breeze to obtain.






Like regular bank deposits, time deposits are insured against any losses.



On the other hand, the rate of return is usually lower than that for other investments. The investor could deposit the same amount of money in a bond mutual fund or Treasury bills and earn a higher yield.



There is another risk, especially if the investor chooses a long term for the time deposit. Interest rates may go up over time, while the investor's money is locked into the rate that prevailed when the account was open.



Higher interest rates go hand in hand with higher inflation. So, that investor's money is shrinking while it sits there, in terms of real spending power.





Pros

Time deposits offer investors a fixed interest rate until maturity.
Time deposits are risk-free investments backed by the FDIC or NCUA.
Time deposits have various maturity dates and minimum deposit amounts.
Time deposits pay a higher interest rate than regular savings accounts.



Cons

Time deposit returns are lower than that of other conservative investments.
Investors may miss a better opportunity if interest rates rise.
Depositors can't withdraw their money without a penalty.
Fixed interest rates don't generally keep pace with inflation.





   Real-World Examples of Time Deposits  

A look at some examples of time deposit returns as of Feb. 9, 2020, offers some insight into the variations among CDs on offer at financial institutions.



American Express advertised CDs with an APY of 0.55% for one year, 2.05% for three years, or 2.15% for five years. There was no minimum deposit.Comenity Direct rates were 2.10% APY for one year, 2.20% for three years, and 2.20% for five years. There was a minimum $1,500 deposit.Synchrony Bank rates were 2.00% APY for one year, 2.10% for three years, and 2.15% for five years. There was a minimum deposit of $2,000.
What Is an Investment Time Horizon?  

An investment time horizon, or just time horizon, is the period of time one expects to hold an investment until they need the money back. Time horizons are largely dictated by investment goals and strategies. For example, saving for a down payment on a house, for maybe two years, would be considered a short-term time horizon while saving for college would be a medium-term time horizon, and investing for retirement, a long-term time horizon.





Key Takeaways

Time horizons are periods where investments are held until they are needed.Time horizons vary according to the investment goal, short or long.Time horizons also vary according to the time by which you begin investing.The longer the time horizon, the longer the power of compounding has to work.Generally speaking, the longer the time horizon, the more aggressive an investor can be in their portfolio, and vice versa.


   Understanding Investment Time Horizons  

An investment time horizon is the time period where one expects to hold an investment for a specific goal. Investments are generally broken down into two main categories: stocks (riskier) and bonds (less risky). The longer the time horizon, the more aggressive, or riskier, a portfolio an investor can build. The shorter the time horizon, the more conservative, or less risky, the portfolio the investor may want to adopt.


  Short-Term Investment Horizon  

The short-term horizon refers to investments that are expected to last for fewer than five years. These investments are appropriate for investors who are approaching retirement or who may need a large sum of cash in the near future. Money market funds, savings accounts, certificates of deposit, and short-term bonds are good choices for short-term investments since they can easily be liquidated for cash.


  Medium-Term Investment Horizon  

Medium-term investments are those which one expects to hold for three to ten years, such as by people saving for college, marriage, or a first home. Medium-term investment strategies tend to balance between high- and low-risk assets, so a mix of stocks and bonds would be a suitable way to protect your wealth without losing value to inflation.


  Long-Term Investment Horizon  

The long-term investment horizon is for investments that one expects to hold for ten or twenty years, or even longer. The most common long-term investments are retirement savings. Long-term investors are typically willing to take greater risks, in exchange for greater rewards.





Tip

Generally speaking, the longer your investment horizon, the more aggressive you can be in choosing your investments.


   Example of an Investment Time Horizon  

Let’s say two people marry, and while they live in the city now, they’d eventually like to move out to the suburbs in a few years. But they don’t have the money for a down payment on a house, so they’ll need to start saving up. That’s a short-term investment horizon, so they’ll probably want to go with something relatively conservative, like a money market fund, to avoid any sharp swings in stocks.



Meanwhile, they’ve both taken advantage of their employers' 401(k) savings funds (an employer-sponsored retirement fund, sometimes with employer matching). And since they’re both young, that’s a long-term time horizon. Given the length of time until their retirement, they can afford to be very aggressive in their asset allocation, upwards of 90% of stocks, as the long investment horizon should allow their portfolio to recover from any short-term downturns.



Next, a baby comes along! Now they have to start thinking about saving for college. That’s more of a medium- or long-term goal, so they can be pretty aggressive in the beginning and then turn a little more conservative as high school graduation for the child comes along. But there is a government saving plan (529) that allows your contributions to grow tax-free, as long as they’re used for educational expenses. 


   Investment Horizon and Risk  

Each type of investment carries different forms of risk, which should be factored into your investment strategy. Businesses can fail, borrowers can default, and even sound investments can be vulnerable in a market downturn. Below, we'll outline some forms of risk and their effects on each type of investment.


  Inflationary Risk  

Inflationary risk refers to the danger that the real value of an investment will fall, due to an unexpected increase in consumer prices. Bonds are particularly susceptible to inflation, since coupon rates are typically fixed; an unexpected spike in inflation could erode any expected gains from the investment. However, it is possible to ameliorate inflationary risk to bonds through Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities.


  Interest Rate Risk  

Interest rate risk is the danger that an unexpected rise in interest rates could eat away some of the gains of an investment. Like inflationary risk, this is typically a concern for fixed-income securities, like bonds. This risk can be reduced by holding bonds of different durations, or investing in interest rate derivatives. 


  Business Risk  

Business risk refers to the danger that a company might fail or go bankrupt, causing any stocks or bonds issued by that company to plummet in value. While no company is immune to business risk, you can go a long way towards avoiding the riskiest companies by carefully evaluating their business plans. You can also reduce your exposure to any one business by having a diversified portfolio.


  Default Risk  

Default risk is the probability that a borrower will be unable to repay its debts. This usually refers to bond issuers, but it could also refer to other debt-based securities. You can reduce your exposure to default risk by investing in bonds with high credit ratings.


  Market Risk  

Market risk, or volatility risk, refers to the chance that the value of an investment could be negatively impacted by speculative behavior, market crashes, or other world events. Since markets trend upwards in the long run, market risk is typically a larger concern for short- and medium-term investment horizons.


   Investment Horizon FAQs  
  What Is an Investment Horizon?  

An investment horizon refers to the timeline in which an investor plans to gain value on their investment. This can range from a few years to several decades.


  Why Is an Investment Horizon Important?  

The length of an investment horizon will determine what types of investment products are most suitable for the investor's goals. Typically, investors seek stable assets for short-term investing. Riskier investments are more acceptable on a longer-term investment horizon, since markets overall tend to trend upwards.


  What Is a Medium-Term Investment Horizon?  

The medium-term investment horizon typically refers to investments of five to ten years, such as people saving for a child's college education.


  What Does Long-Term Horizon Mean?  

The long-term horizon refers to investments that have a decade or more to accumulate profits. The most common type of long-term investment is saving for retirement.


  What Is the Ideal Investment Horizon?  

Since interest compounds exponentially, a longer investment horizon can generate much greater profits than a short-term investment. This is why it is important to save for retirement early—a small investment now can generate high returns if it has a few decades to grow.


   The Bottom Line  

Every investor needs to carefully evaluate their own goals and investment timeline before deciding where to put their money. Savings accounts and CDs may be a convenient place to store money over the short term, but will quickly lose their value to inflation. Conversely, aggressive investments in the stock market will generate high expected returns in the long run, but they will remain susceptible to short-term market fluctuations. It falls on each investor to decide the optimal balance of risk and rewards.
What Is Time In Force?  

Time in force is a special instruction used when placing a trade to indicate how long an order will remain active before it is executed or expires. These options are especially important for active traders and allow them to be more specific about the time parameters.



Common examples include immediate-or-cancel (IOC) or day order.





Key Takeaways

Time in force indicates how long an order will remain active before it expires with your broker.Time in force for an option is accomplished through different order types.Common examples of time in force specifications include day order, immediate-or-cancel (IOC), fill-or-kill (FOK), or good-'til-canceled (GTC).


   Basics of Time In Force  

Time in force orders are a useful way for active traders to keep from accidentally executing trades. By setting time parameters, they don’t have to remember to cancel old trades. Unintended trade executions can be very costly, if they occur during volatile market conditions when prices are rapidly changing.



Most active traders use limit orders to control the price that they pay for a stock, which means that they set a time in force option to control how long the order stays open. While day orders are the most common type of order, there are many circumstances when it makes sense to user other order types.



There are several different types of time in force orders that traders can use. Some brokers only offer a limited set of order types, but active traders often are given more options. Many brokers use acronyms like DAY, GTC, OPC, IOC, GTD, and DTC to refer to these orders. We look a little more closely at these order types below.


   Types of Time In Force Orders  

Day orders are a popular type of time in force order. They are canceled if the trade does not execute by the close of the trading day. These are often the default order type for brokerage accounts.



Another type of time in force order are Good-Til-Canceled (GTC) orders, which are effective until the trade is executed or canceled. Some common exceptions include stock splits, distributions, account inactivity, modified orders, and during quarterly sweeps. These can be a useful option for a long-term investor who is willing to wait for a stock to reach their desired price point before pulling the trigger. Sometimes, traders might wait several days or even weeks for a trade to execute at their desired price.



Fill-or-Kill (FOK) orders are a third type of time in force order. They are canceled if the entire order does not execute as soon as it becomes available. Often, these are used to avoid purchasing shares in multiple blocks at different prices and to ensure an entire order executes at a single price. These can be popular during fast-moving markets where day traders wants to ensure that they get a good price on a trade.



A few other order types include Market-on-Open (MOO) and Limit-on-Open (LOO)orders, which execute as soon as a market opens; immediate-or-cancel (IOC) orders, which must be filled immediately or are canceled; and day-til-canceled (DTC) orders that are deactivated at the end of the day instead of canceled, making it easier to re-transmit the order later.


   Example of Time in Force  

John believes that the price of stock ABC, which is currently trading at $10, will rise but it will take time, approximately three months. He purchases ABC call options with a strike price of $15 and places a Good 'Til Cancelled (GTC) order. To avoid having the order remain on hold indefinitely, he places a limit of three months on the order. After three months, stock ABC's price is still struggling to break past the $12 mark. John's order is cancelled automatically.
What Is the Times Interest Earned Ratio?  

The times interest earned (TIE) ratio is a measure of a company's ability to meet its debt obligations based on its current income. The formula for a company's TIE number is earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) divided by the total interest payable on bonds and other debt.



The result is a number that shows how many times a company could cover its interest charges with its pretax earnings.



TIE is also referred to as the interest coverage ratio.

Key Takeaways

A company's TIE indicates its ability to pay its debts.A better TIE number means a company has enough cash after paying its debts to continue to invest in the business.The formula for TIE is calculated as earnings before interest and taxes divided by total interest payable on debt.


   Understanding the Times Interest Earned (TIE) Ratio  

Obviously, no company needs to cover its debts several times over in order to survive. However, the TIE ratio is an indication of a company's relative freedom from the constraints of debt. Generating enough cash flow to continue to invest in the business is better than merely having enough money to stave off bankruptcy.



A company's capitalization is the amount of money it has raised by issuing stock or debt, and those choices impact its TIE ratio. Businesses consider the cost of capital for stock and debt and use that cost to make decisions.


  How to Calculate Times Interest Earned (TIE)  

Assume, for example, that XYZ Company has $10 million in 4% debt outstanding and $10 million in common stock. The company needs to raise more capital to purchase equipment. The cost of capital for issuing more debt is an annual interest rate of 6%. The company's shareholders expect an annual dividend payment of 8% plus growth in the stock price of XYZ.






Companies that have consistent earnings, like utilities, tend to borrow more because they are good credit risks.



The business decides to issue $10 million in additional debt. Its total annual interest expense will be: (4% X $10 million) + (6% X $10 million), or $1 million annually. The company's EBIT is $3 million.



This means that the TIE ratio for XYZ Company is 3, or three times the annual interest expense.


  Factoring in Consistent Earnings  

As a rule, companies that generate consistent annual earnings are likely to carry more debt as a percentage of total capitalization. If a lender sees a history of generating consistent earnings, the firm will be considered a better credit risk.



Utility companies, for example, generate consistent earnings. Their product is not an optional expense for consumers or businesses. Some utility companies raise a considerable percentage of their capital by issuing debt.



Startup firms and businesses that have inconsistent earnings, on the other hand, raise most or all of the capital they use by issuing stock. Once a company establishes a track record of producing reliable earnings, it may begin raising capital through debt offerings as well.
What Is a Time Series?  

A time series is a sequence of data points that occur in successive order over some period of time. This can be contrasted with cross-sectional data, which captures a point in time.



In investing, a time series tracks the movement of the chosen data points, such as a security’s price, over a specified period of time with data points recorded at regular intervals. There is no minimum or maximum amount of time that must be included, allowing the data to be gathered in a way that provides the information being sought by the investor or analyst examining the activity.





Key Takeaways

A time series is a data set that tracks a sample over time.In particular, a time series allows one to see what factors influence certain variables from period to period.Time series analysis can be useful to see how a given asset, security, or economic variable changes over time.Forecasting methods using time series are used in both fundamental and technical analysis.Although cross-sectional data is seen as the opposite of time series, the two are often used together in practice.


   Understanding Time Series  

A time series can be taken on any variable that changes over time. In investing, it is common to use a time series to track the price of a security over time. This can be tracked over the short term, such as the price of a security on the hour over the course of a business day, or the long term, such as the price of a security at close on the last day of every month over the course of five years.



Time series analysis can be useful to see how a given asset, security, or economic variable changes over time. It also can be used to examine how the changes associated with the chosen data point compare to shifts in other variables over the same time period.



Time series is also used in several nonfinancial contexts, such as measuring the change in population over time. The figure below depicts such a time series for the growth of the U.S. population over the century from 1900 to 2000.

   Time Series Analysis  

Suppose you wanted to analyze a time series of daily closing stock prices for a given stock over a period of one year. You would obtain a list of all the closing prices for the stock from each day for the past year and list them in chronological order. This would be a one-year daily closing price time series for the stock.



Delving a bit deeper, you might analyze time series data with technical analysis tools to know whether the stock’s time series shows any seasonality. This will help to determine if the stock goes through peaks and troughs at regular times each year. Analysis in this area would require taking the observed prices and correlating them to a chosen season. This can include traditional calendar seasons, such as summer and winter, or retail seasons, such as holiday seasons.



Alternatively, you can record a stock’s share price changes as it relates to an economic variable, such as the unemployment rate. By correlating the data points with information relating to the selected economic variable, you can observe patterns in situations exhibiting dependency between the data points and the chosen variable.






One potential issue with time series data is that since each variable is dependent on its prior state or value, there can be a great deal of autocorrelation, which can bias results.


   Time Series Forecasting  

Time series forecasting uses information regarding historical values and associated patterns to predict future activity. Most often, this relates to trend analysis, cyclical fluctuation analysis, and issues of seasonality. As with all forecasting methods, success is not guaranteed.



The Box-Jenkins Model, for instance, is a technique designed to forecast data ranges based on inputs from a specified time series. It forecasts data using three principles: autoregression, differencing, and moving averages. These three principles are known as p, d, and q, respectively. Each principle is used in the Box-Jenkins analysis, and together they are collectively shown as an autoregressive integrated moving average, or ARIMA (p, d, q). ARIMA can be used, for instance, to forecast stock prices or earnings growth.



Another method, known as rescaled range analysis, can be used to detect and evaluate the amount of persistence, randomness, or mean reversion in time series data. The rescaled range can be used to extrapolate a future value or average for the data to see if a trend is stable or likely to reverse.


   Cross-Sectional vs. Time Series Analysis  

Cross-sectional analysis is one of the two overarching comparison methods for stock analysis. Cross-sectional analysis looks at data collected at a single point in time, rather than over a period of time. The analysis begins with the establishment of research goals and the definition of the variables that an analyst wants to measure. The next step is to identify the cross section, such as a group of peers or an industry, and to set the specific point in time being assessed. The final step is to conduct analysis, based on the cross section and the variables, and come to a conclusion on the performance of a company or organization. Essentially, cross-sectional analysis shows an investor which company is best given the metrics that they care about.



Time series analysis, known as trend analysis when it applies to technical trading, focuses on a single security over time. In this case, the price is being judged in the context of its past performance. Time series analysis shows an investor whether the company is doing better or worse than before by the measures that they care about. Often these will be classics like earnings per share (EPS), debt to equity, free cash flow (FCF), and so on. In practice, investors will usually use a combination of time series analysis and cross-sectional analysis before making a decision—for example, looking at the EPS over time and then checking the industry benchmark EPS.




What Are Some Examples of Time Series?
A time series can be constructed by any data that is measured over time at evenly spaced intervals. Historical stock prices, earnings, gross domestic product (GDP), or other sequences of financial or economic data can be analyzed as a time series.




How Do You Analyze Time Series Data?
Statistical techniques can be used to analyze time series data in two key ways: to generate inferences on how one or more variables affect some variable of interest over time, or to forecast future trends. Unlike cross-sectional data, which is essentially one slice of a time series, the arrow of time allows an analyst to make more plausible causal claims.




What Is the Distinction Between Cross-Sectional and Time Series Data?
A cross section looks at a single point in time, which is useful for comparing and analyzing the effect of different factors on one another or describing a sample. Time series involves repeated sampling of the same data over time. In practice, both forms of analysis are commonly used, and when available, they are used together.




How Are Time Series Used in Data Mining?
Data mining is a process that turns reams of raw data into useful information. By utilizing software to look for patterns in large batches of data, businesses can learn more about their customers to develop more effective marketing strategies, increase sales, and decrease costs. Time series, such as a historical record of corporate filings or financial statements, are particularly useful here to identify trends and patterns that may be forecasted into the future.


   The Bottom Line  

A time series is a sequence of numerical data points in successive order. In investing, it tracks the movement of the chosen data points at regular intervals and over a specified period of time.In investing, a time series records chosen data points (such as a security’s price) at regular intervals and tracks their movement over a specified period of time.



Time series analysis can be useful to see what factors influence certain variables from period to period. It can also provide insights into how an asset, security, or economic variable changes over time.



A variety of financial and economic data, such as historical stock prices, earnings, and GDP, can be analyzed as a time series.
What Is Time Value?  

Time value refers to the portion of an option's premium that is attributable to the amount of time remaining until the expiration of the option contract. The premium of any option consists of two components: its intrinsic value and its extrinsic value.



Time value is a component of an option's extrinsic value, alongside implied volatility (IV), and relates to derivatives markets. It should not be confused with the time value of money (TVM), which describes the discounting of money's purchasing power over time.





Key Takeaways

Time value is one of two key components, the other being implied volatility, that comprise an option's extrinsic value.An option's total price, or premium, is the aggregation of its intrinsic and extrinsic value.Generally, the more time that remains until the option expires, the greater the time value of the option.


   The Basics of Time Value  

The price (or cost) of an option is an amount of money known as the premium. An option buyer pays this premium to an option seller in exchange for the right granted by the option: the choice to exercise the option to buy or sell an asset or to allow it to expire worthless.



The intrinsic value is the difference between the price of the underlying asset and the strike price of the option. The intrinsic value for a call option—the right, but not the obligation, to buy an asset—is equal to the underlying price minus the strike price, while the intrinsic value for a put option—the right to sell an asset—is equal to the strike price minus the underlying price.



An option's total premium is based on its intrinsic plus extrinsic value. A key part of extrinsic value is known as "time value." Under normal circumstances, a contract loses value as it approaches its expiration date because there is less time for the underlying security to move favorably. In other words, an option with one month to expiration that is out of the money (OTM) will have more extrinsic value than that of an OTM option with one week to expiration.






Typically, the more time that remains until the option expires, the greater its time value, as the contract will have longer to become profitable.



Another factor that affects extrinsic value and time value is implied volatility (IV). IV measures the amount an underlying asset may move over a specified period. If the IV increases, the extrinsic value will also increase. For instance, if an investor purchases a call option with an annualized IV of 20% and the IV jumps to 30% the following day, the extrinsic value would rise as investors figure that dramatic moves boost the possibility of the asset moving their way.


  Calculating Time Value  

As an equation, time value might be expressed as:



Option Premium - Intrinsic Value = Time Value + Implied Volatility



Or, to put it another way: the amount of a premium that is in excess of the option's intrinsic value is referred to as its time value. For example, if Alphabet Inc. stock is priced at $1,044 per share and the Alphabet Inc. $950 call option is trading at $97, then the option has an intrinsic value of $94 ($1,044 - $950) and a time value of $3 ($97 - $94).

   The Significance of Time Value  

As a general rule, the more time that remains until expiration, the greater the time value of the option. The rationale is simple: Investors are willing to pay a higher premium for more time since the contract will have longer to profit from a favorable move in the underlying asset.



Conversely, the less time that remains on an option, the less of a premium investors are willing to pay, because the probability of the option having the chance to be profitable is shrinking. For this reason, it's safer to sell or hold an option that still has time value left, rather than exercising it; otherwise, that remaining time value would be lost.






Theoretically, adding time to an option or increasing the IV have the same fundamental effect: increasing the probability that an option will finish in the money (ITM).



In general, an option loses one-third of its time value during the first half of its life, and the remaining two-thirds of its time value during the second half. Time value decreases over time at an accelerating pace, a phenomenon known as time decay or time-value decay. An option price's sensitivity to time decay is known as its theta.
What Is the Time Value of Money (TVM)?  

The time value of money (TVM) is the concept that a sum of money is worth more now than the same sum will be at a future date due to its earnings potential in the interim. The time value of money is a core principle of finance. A sum of money in the hand has greater value than the same sum to be paid in the future. The time value of money is also referred to as the present discounted value.





Key Takeaways

The time value of money means that a sum of money is worth more now than the same sum of money in the future.The principle of the time value of money means that it can grow only through investing so a delayed investment is a lost opportunity.The formula for computing the time value of money considers the amount of money, its future value, the amount it can earn, and the time frame.For savings accounts, the number of compounding periods is an important determinant as well.Inflation has a negative impact on the time value of money because your purchasing power decreases as prices rise.

   Understanding the Time Value of Money (TVM)  

Investors prefer to receive money today rather than the same amount of money in the future because a sum of money, once invested, grows over time. For example, money deposited into a savings account earns interest. Over time, the interest is added to the principal, earning more interest. That's the power of compounding interest. 



If it is not invested, the value of the money erodes over time. If you hide $1,000 in a mattress for three years, you will lose the additional money it could have earned over that time if invested. It will have even less buying power when you retrieve it because inflation reduces its value.



As another example, say you have the option of receiving $10,000 now or $10,000 two years from now. Despite the equal face value, $10,000 today has more value and utility than it will two years from now due to the opportunity costs associated with the delay. In other words, a delayed payment is a missed opportunity.



The time value of money has a negative relationship with inflation. Remember that inflation is an increase in the prices of goods and services. As such, the value of a single dollar goes down when prices rise, which means you can't purchase as much as you were able to in the past.


   Time Value of Money Formula  

The most fundamental formula for the time value of money takes into account the following: the future value of money, the present value of money, the interest rate, the number of compounding periods per year, and the number of years.



Based on these variables, the formula for TVM is:

Keep in mind, though that the TVM formula may change slightly depending on the situation. For example, in the case of annuity or perpetuity payments, the generalized formula has additional or fewer factors.






The time value of money doesn't take into account any capital losses that you may incur or any negative interest rates that may apply. In these cases, you may be able to use negative growth rates to calculate the time value of money


   Examples of Time Value of Money  

Here's a hypothetical example to show how the time value of money works. Let's assume a sum of $10,000 is invested for one year at 10% interest compounded annually. The future value of that money is:

FV​=$10,000×(1+110%​)1×1=$11,000​



The formula can also be rearranged to find the value of the future sum in present-day dollars. For example, the present-day dollar amount compounded annually at 7% interest that would be worth $5,000 one year from today is:

PV​=[(1+17%​)$5,000​]1×1=$4,673​


  Effect of Compounding Periods on Future Value  

The number of compounding periods has a dramatic effect on the TVM calculations. Taking the $10,000 example above, if the number of compounding periods is increased to quarterly, monthly, or daily, the ending future value calculations are:

FV=$10,000×(1+36510%​)365×1=$11,052



This shows that the TVM depends not only on the interest rate and time horizon but also on how many times the compounding calculations are computed each year.




How Does the Time Value of Money Relate to Opportunity Cost?
Opportunity cost is key to the concept of the time value of money. Money can grow only if it is invested over time and earns a positive return. Money that is not invested loses value over time. Therefore, a sum of money that is expected to be paid in the future, no matter how confidently it is expected, is losing value in the meantime.




Why Is the Time Value of Money Important?
The concept of the time value of money can help guide investment decisions. For instance, suppose an investor can choose between two projects: Project A and Project B. They are identical except that Project A promises a $1 million cash payout in year one, whereas Project B offers a $1 million cash payout in year five. The payouts are not equal. The $1 million payout received after one year has a higher present value than the $1 million payout after five years.




How Is the Time Value of Money Used in Finance?
It would be hard to find a single area of finance where the time value of money does not influence the decision-making process. The time value of money is the central concept in discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis, which is one of the most popular and influential methods for valuing investment opportunities. It is also an integral part of financial planning and risk management activities. Pension fund managers, for instance, consider the time value of money to ensure that their account holders will receive adequate funds in retirement.




What Impact Does Inflation Have on the Time Value of Money?
The value of money changes over time and there are several factors that can affect it. Inflation, which is the general rise in prices of goods and services, has a negative impact on the future value of money. That's because when prices rise, your money only goes so far. Even a slight increase in prices means that your purchasing power drops. So that dollar you earned in 2015 and kept in your piggy bank buys less today than it would have back then.




How Do You Calculate the Time Value of Money?
The time value of money takes several things into account when calculating the future value of money, including the present value of money (PV), the number of compounding periods per year (n), the total number of years (t), and the interest rate (i). You can use the following formula to calculate the time value of money: FV = PV x [1 + (i / n)] (n x t).


   The Bottom Line  

The future value of money isn't the same as present-day dollars. And the same is true about money from the past. This phenomenon is known as the time value of money. Businesses can use it to gauge the potential for future projects. And as an investor, you can use it to pinpoint investment opportunities. Put simply, knowing what TVM is and how to calculate it can help you make sound decisions about how you spend, save, and invest.
What is Time-Weighted Rate of Return – TWR?  

The time-weighted rate of return (TWR) is a measure of the compound rate of growth in a portfolio. The TWR measure is often used to compare the returns of investment managers because it eliminates the distorting effects on growth rates created by inflows and outflows of money. The time-weighted return breaks up the return on an investment portfolio into separate intervals based on whether money was added or withdrawn from the fund.



The time-weighted return measure is also called the geometric mean return, which is a complicated way of stating that the returns for each sub-period are multiplied by each other.

   How to Calculate TWR  

Calculate the rate of return for each sub-period by subtracting the beginning balance of the period from the ending balance of the period and divide the result by the beginning balance of the period.
Create a new sub-period for each period that there is a change in cash flow, whether it's a withdrawal or deposit. You'll be left with multiple periods, each with a rate of return. Add 1 to each rate of return, which simply makes negative returns easier to calculate.
Multiply the rate of return for each sub-period by each other. Subtract 1 from the result to achieve the TWR.






   What Does TWR Tell You?  

It can be difficult to determine how much money was earned on a portfolio when there are multiple deposits and withdrawals made over time. Investors can't simply subtract the beginning balance, after the initial deposit, from the ending balance since the ending balance reflects both the rate of return on the investments and any deposits or withdrawals during the time invested in the fund. In other words, deposits and withdrawals distort the value of the return on the portfolio.



The time-weighted return breaks up the return on an investment portfolio into separate intervals based on whether money was added or withdrawn from the fund. The TWR provides the rate of return for each sub-period or interval that had cash flow changes. By isolating the returns that had cash flow changes, the result is more accurate than simply taking the beginning balance and ending balance of the time invested in a fund. The time-weighted return multiplies the returns for each sub-period or holding-period, which links them together showing how the returns are compounded over time.



When calculating the time-weighted rate of return, it is assumed that all cash distributions are reinvested in the portfolio. Daily portfolio valuations are needed whenever there is external cash flow, such as a deposit or a withdrawal, which would denote the start of a new sub-period. In addition, sub-periods must be the same to compare the returns of different portfolios or investments. These periods are then geometrically linked to determine the time-weighted rate of return.



Because investment managers that deal in publicly traded securities do not typically have control over fund investors' cash flows, the time-weighted rate of return is a popular performance measure for these types of funds as opposed to the internal rate of return (IRR), which is more sensitive to cash-flow movements.





Key Takeaways

The time-weighted return (TWR) multiplies the returns for each sub-period or holding-period, which links them together showing how the returns are compounded over time. ﻿The time-weighted return (TWR) helps eliminate the distorting effects on growth rates created by inflows and outflows of money.


   Examples of Using the TWR  

As noted, the time-weighted return eliminates the effects of portfolio cash flows on returns. To see this how it works, consider the following two investor scenarios:


  Scenario 1  

Investor 1 invests $1 million into Mutual Fund A on December 31. On August 15 of the following year, their portfolio is valued at $1,162,484. At that point (August 15), they add $100,000 to Mutual Fund A, bringing the total value to $1,262,484.



By the end of the year, the portfolio has decreased in value to $1,192,328. The holding-period return for the first period, from December 31 to August 15, would be calculated as:



Return = ($1,162,484 - $1,000,000) / $1,000,000 = 16.25%



The holding-period return for the second period, from August 15 to December 31, would be calculated as: 



Return = ($1,192,328 - ($1,162,484 + $100,000)) / ($1,162,484 + $100,000) = -5.56%



The second sub-period is created following the $100,000 deposit so that the rate of return is calculated reflecting that deposit with its new starting balance of $1,262,484 or ($1,162,484 + $100,000).



The time-weighted return for the two time periods is calculated by multiplying each subperiod's rate of return by each other. The first period is the period leading up to the deposit, and the second period is after the $100,000 deposit.



Time-weighted return = (1 + 16.25%) x (1 + (-5.56%)) - 1 = 9.79%


  Scenario 2  

Investor 2 invests $1 million into Mutual Fund A on December 31. On August 15 of the following year, their portfolio is valued at $1,162,484. At that point (August 15), they withdraw $100,000 from Mutual Fund A, bringing the total value down to $1,062,484.



By the end of the year, the portfolio has decreased in value to $1,003,440. The holding-period return for the first period, from December 31 to August 15, would be calculated as:



Return = ($1,162,484 - $1,000,000) / $1,000,000 = 16.25%



The holding-period return for the second period, from August 15 to December 31, would be calculated as:



Return = ($1,003,440 - ($1,162,484 - $100,000)) / ($1,162,484 - $100,000) = -5.56%



The time-weighted return over the two time periods is calculated by multiplying or geometrically linking these two returns:



Time-weighted return = (1 + 16.25%) x (1 + (-5.56%)) - 1 = 9.79%



As expected, both investors received the same 9.79% time-weighted return, even though one added money and the other withdrew money. Eliminating the cash flow effects is precisely why time-weighted return is an important concept that allows investors to compare the investment returns of their portfolios and any financial product.


   Difference Between TWR and ROR  

A rate of return (ROR) is the net gain or loss on an investment over a specified time period, expressed as a percentage of the investment’s initial cost. Gains on investments are defined as income received plus any capital gains realized on the sale of the investment.



However, the rate of return calculation does not account for the cash flow differences in the portfolio, whereas the TWR accounts for all deposits and withdrawals in determining the rate of return.


   Limitations of the TWR  

Due to changing cash flows in and out of funds on a daily basis, the TWR can be an extremely cumbersome way to calculate and keep track of the cash flows. It's best to use an online calculator or computational software. Another often-used rate of return calculation is the money-weighted rate of return.
What Is the Times-Revenue Method?  

The times-revenue method determines the maximum value of a company as a multiple of its revenue for a set period of time. The multiple varies by industry and other factors but is typically one or two. In some industries, the multiple might be less than one.





Key Takeaways

The times-revenue method is used to determine the maximum value of a company.It's meant to generate a range of value for a business based on the company's revenue for a previous period.Times-revenue valuation will vary from one industry to the next due to the sector's growth potential. That makes comparing companies misleading.This method is not always a reliable indicator of the value of a firm as revenue does not mean profit and an increase in revenue does not always translate into an increase in profits.This method has the benefit of being easy to calculate, especially if the company already has a set of financial statements with reliable revenue totals.


   Understanding the Times-Revenue Method  

The value of a business might be determined for various reasons, including to aid financial planning or in preparation for selling the business.



It can be challenging to calculate the value of a business, especially if the value is largely determined by potential future revenues. Several models can be used to determine the value, or a range of values, to facilitate business decisions.



The times-revenue method attempts to value a business by valuing its cash flow.



The times-revenue method is used to determine a range of values for a business. The figure is based on actual revenues over a certain period of time (for example, the previous fiscal year). A multiplier provides a range that can be used as a starting point for negotiations.



The multiplier used in business valuation depends on the industry.



Small business valuation often involves finding the absolute lowest price someone would pay for the business, known as the "floor." This is often the liquidation value of the business's assets. Then, a ceiling is set. This is the maximum amount that a buyer might pay, such as a multiple of current revenues.



Once the floor and ceiling have been calculated, the business owner can determine the value, or what someone may be willing to pay to acquire the business. The value of the multiple used for evaluating the company’s value using the times-revenue method is influenced by a number of factors including the macroeconomic environment and industry conditions.






The times-revenue method is also referred to as the multiples of revenue method.


   Who Can Benefit From the Times-Revenue Method?  

The times-revenue method is ideal for young companies with earnings that are volatile or non-existent. Also, companies that are poised to have a speedy growth stage, such as software-as-a-service firms, will base their valuations on the times-revenue method.



The multiple used might be higher if the company or industry is poised for growth and expansion. Since these companies are expected to have a high growth phase with a high percentage of recurring revenue and good margins, they would be valued in the three- to four-times-revenue range.



The multiplier might be one if the business is slow-growing or doesn't show much growth potential. A company with a low percentage of recurring revenue or consistently low forecasted revenue, such as a service company, may be valued at 0.5 times revenue.


   Criticism of the Times-Revenue Method  

The times-revenue method is not always a reliable indicator of the value of a firm. This is because revenue does not mean profit. The times-revenue method fails to consider the expenses of a company or whether the company is producing positive net income.



Moreover, an increase in revenue does not necessarily translate into an increase in profits. A company may experience 10% year-over-year growth in revenue, yet the company may be experiencing 25% year-over-year growth in expenses.



Valuing a company only on its revenue stream fails to consider what it costs to generate its revenue.



To get a more accurate picture of the current real value of a company, earnings must be factored in. Thus, the multiples of earnings, or earnings multiplier, is preferred to the multiples of revenue method.






The times-revenue method can be calculated forward or backward. You can divide the purchase price by annual revenue to arrive at the multiple, or you can multiple annual revenues by a desired times-revenue target to arrive at a potential target price.


   Example of Times-Revenue Method  

In fiscal year 2021, X (formerly Twitter) reported annual revenue of $5.077 billion. Annual revenue for grew from 2020 to 2021 by over $1.3 billion. In 2022, Elon Musk announced his intention to acquire the company for $44 billion. This decision was later reversed and solidified via Securities and Exchange Commission filings.



The acquisition occurred at a company valuation of approximately 8.7 times-revenue. This means that at an acquisition price of $44 billion, Musk paid 8.7 times the annual revenue of X ($5.1 billion).



The company's net annual loss for the same period demonstrates a glaring weakness of the times-revenue model. In 2021, it incurred an annual loss of $221 million, its second consecutive year of negative profit. Although the times-revenue valuation method indicates a value of 8.7, the method fails to consider that the company was not a profitable company at the time.



As a postscript, X recorded $4.4 billion in revenue in 2022, an 11% decline. Its estimated loss for the year was $152 million. That number presumably reflects some of the severe cost-cutting initiated by Musk after his takeover but also could include some of the estimated cost of repaying the $13 billion in loans Musk took out in order to finance the purchase.



In April 2023, it ceased to exist as a separate corporate entity and was merged int X Corp., a wholly-owned subsidiary of X Holdings Corp., which is owned by Musk.




How Do You Calculate Times-Revenue?
Times-revenue is calculated by dividing the selling price of a company by the prior 12 months revenue of the company. The result indicates how many times of annual income a buyer was willing to pay for a company.




What Is a Good Times-Revenue Multiple?
Every company, industry, and sector will have different guidelines on what constitutes a good times-revenue valuation. Companies in higher growth industries will often sell for higher multiples due to the greater potential of future revenue. Alternatively, companies of different sizes may be valued differently due to the inherent risk of a newer business compared to an established company.




How Is the Times-Revenue Method Used?
Times-revenue is used to set a benchmark purchase price of a company. Using only the revenue of the business, a buyer can estimate a fair selling price by imputing what times-revenue they are willing to pay. Alternatively, a seller may have a purchase price in mind but must check times-revenue for reasonableness.




Is a Low Times Multiple Bad?
A low times multiple isn't necessarily bad. It simply means the company is being valued lower than other companies. If a seller is motivated to sell, having a low times multiple may be a good thing as it may be seen by buyers as a cheaper, potentially bargain price compared to companies with much higher multiples.


   The Bottom Line  

The times-revenue method of valuing a company has the virtue of being straightforward. It's revenue for a certain period multiplied by a set factor, usually one or two, to arrive at a figure that reflects the company's value.



It has a big drawback, though. Cash flow does not equal profits, and a valuation based on the times-revenue method does not reflect the costs of doing business.



There is another drawback that is shared by every method of valuation: All are, by necessity, based on past performance and none can accurately predict future sales.
What Is TINA?  

TINA is an acronym for "there is no alternative."



It is often used by investors to justify a lackluster performance by stocks on the grounds that other asset classes offer even worse returns.



Acceptance of TINA can lead to the "TINA Effect," a phenomenon in which stocks rise only because investors see no viable alternative place to put their money. In particular, during times when bonds are performing poorly, stocks appear to be the only choice.



In periods when stock prices soar and bond returns languish, TINA has been used to justify investing in anything other than stocks or bonds, such as cryptocurrencies and non-fungible tokens (NFTs).





Key Takeaways

TINA is an acronym for the phrase, "there is no alternative."The term was coined in the 19th century and has persisted as a justification for political and financial decisions.The phrase is used to suggest that, in a world of bad choices, one must be the least bad.The TINA effect can explain a price bubble. That is, prices rise to unrealistic heights due to a lack of reasonable alternatives.


   Origins of TINA  

Herbert Spencer, who lived from 1820 to 1903, was a British intellectual who strongly defended classical liberalism. He believed in laissez-faire government and positivism, or the ability of technological and social progress to solve society's problems.



Spencer considered that Darwin's theory of the "survival of the fittest" should apply to human interactions. To critics of capitalism, free markets, and democracy, he frequently responded, "There is no alternative."



TINA can evoke positive or negative connotations. On the positive side, believing that there is no alternative to some course of action can rally support around the chosen path. On the other hand, such a belief may create a sense of resignation in those who disapprove of the chosen path.


   The TINA Effect in Politics  

Margaret Thatcher, a Conservative who served as Britain's prime minister from 1979 to 1990, used TINA as a political slogan.



She deployed the phrase when responding to critics of her market-oriented policies of deregulation, political centralization, spending cuts, and a rollback of the welfare state.



Actually, there were alternatives to this approach, including the policies advocated by the opposition Labour Party. To Thatcher, however, free-market neoliberalism had no alternative.



After the collapse of the Soviet Union, American political scientist Francis Fukuyama argued that Thatcher's view had been permanently vindicated. With communism discredited, he wrote, no ideology could ever seriously compete with capitalism and democracy again: the "end of history" that Marx promised had arrived, albeit in a form he failed to predict.


  India Embraces TINA (and NOTA)  

TINA made its mark on the politics of India when Prime Minister Narendra Modi led his party to a resounding victory in 2014. He embraced the phrase and it soon became associated with his policies.



The inevitable backlash came with his opponents adopting their own acronym: NOTA for "none of the above."


   The TINA Effect on Investments  

A different interpretation of the TINA effect has been heard among investors in recent years, and the phrase now refers to a lack of satisfactory alternatives to an investment that is seen as questionable. For example, late in a bull market, investors might become concerned with the possibility of a reversal and be unwilling to allocate a major share of their portfolios to stocks.



On the other hand, if bonds offer low yields and illiquid assets such as private equity or real estate are also unattractive, investors may hold stocks despite their concerns rather than revert to cash.



If enough participants are of the same mind, the market can experience a "TINA effect," continuing to rise despite an apparent lack of drivers simply there are no other options for making money.



British fund manager Terry Smith believes that the TINA logic is particularly appealing, rightly or wrongly, in periods of inflation. In a 2022 letter to investors, Smith writes that stocks are seen by some investors as "the least poorly performing sector in such conditions because of the ability of at least some companies to continue to grow revenue in real terms and generate real returns on capital above the rate of inflation."
What Is Tit for Tat?  

Tit for tat is a game-theory strategy subject to a payoff matrix like that of a prisoner's dilemma. Tit for tat was introduced by Anatol Rapoport, who developed a strategy in which each participant in an iterated prisoner's dilemma follows a course of action consistent with his opponent's previous turn.﻿﻿ For example, if provoked, a player subsequently responds with retaliation; if unprovoked, the player cooperates. The tit-for-tat strategy is not exclusive to economics. It is used in many fields, including psychology and sociology. In biology, it is likened to reciprocal altruism.





Key Takeaways

Tit for tat is a game-theory strategy in which each participant mimics the action of their opponent after cooperating in the first round.Tit for tat can be used in games with repeated moves or in a series of similar games.Tit for tat emphasizes that cooperation between participants produces a more favorable outcome than a non-cooperative strategy.Tit-for-tat strategies are found in economics, psychology, sociology, biology, and multiple other fields.


   Understanding Tit for Tat  

Tit for tat is a strategy that can be implemented in games with repeated moves or in a series of similar games. The concept revolves around game theory, an economic framework that explains how humans interact with each other in competitive environments. There are two types of game theory: cooperative game theory and uncooperative game theory. Cooperative game theory involves participants negotiating and cooperating to achieve the best outcome. Non-cooperative game theory involves no negotiation or cooperation between opposing parties.



Tit for tat posits that a person is more successful if they cooperate with another person. Implementing a tit-for-tat strategy occurs when one agent cooperates with another agent in the very first interaction and then mimics their subsequent moves. This strategy is based on the concepts of retaliation and altruism. When faced with a dilemma, an individual cooperates when another member has an immediate history of cooperating and defaults when the counterparty previously defaulted.


   Example of Tit for Tat  

The prisoner's dilemma is a famous economic scenario used to explain the field of social science. It helps show people the balance between cooperation and competition in business, politics, and general social settings.



In the traditional version of the game, two individuals are arrested and presented with a dilemma. If both confess, they each serve five years in jail. If Prisoner One confesses and Prisoner Two does not, Prisoner Two serves seven years and Prisoner One goes free. If both agents do not confess, they each serve three years. The tit-for-tat strategy is to start with cooperation and not confess, assuming the other agent follows suit.



For example, two competing economies can use a tit-for-tat strategy so that both participants benefit. One economy starts with cooperation by not imposing import tariffs on the other economy's goods and services to induce good behavior. The idea is that the second economy responds by also choosing not to impose import tariffs. If the second economy reacts by implementing tariffs, the first economy retaliates by implementing tariffs of its own to discourage the behavior.
What Is Title Insurance?  

Title insurance is a form of indemnity insurance that protects lenders and homebuyers from financial loss sustained from defects in a title to a property. The most common type of title insurance is lender’s title insurance, which the borrower purchases to protect the lender. The other type is owner’s title insurance, which is often paid for by the seller to protect the buyer’s equity in the property.





Key Takeaways

Title insurance protects lenders and buyers from financial loss due to defects in a title to a property.The most common claims filed against a title are back taxes, liens, and conflicting wills.A one-time fee paid for title insurance covers pricey administrative fees for deep searches of title data to protect against claims for past occurrences.Any real estate transactions must have a clear title to ensure that the property is free from liens.A title insurance policy will cover numerous risks like flawed records, incorrect ownership, and falsified documents.


   Understanding Title Insurance  

A clear title is necessary for any real estate transaction. Title companies must do a search on every title to check for claims or liens of any kind against them before they can be issued.



A title search is an examination of public records to determine and confirm a property’s legal ownership and determine whether there are any claims on the property. Erroneous surveys and unresolved building code violations are two examples of blemishes that can make the title “dirty.”



Title insurance protects both lenders and homebuyers against loss or damage occurring from liens, encumbrances, or defects in a property’s title or actual ownership. Common claims filed against a title are back taxes, liens (from mortgage loans, home equity lines of credit (HELOCs), easements), and conflicting wills. Unlike traditional insurance, which protects against future events, title insurance protects against claims for past occurrences.



A basic owner’s title insurance policy typically covers the following hazards:



Ownership by another partyIncorrect signatures on documents, in addition to forgery and fraudFlawed recordsRestrictive covenants (terms that reduce value or enjoyment), such as unrecorded easementsEncumbrances or judgments against property, such as outstanding lawsuits and liens






In lieu of title insurance, some private transactions can involve a warranty of title, which is a guarantee by a seller to a buyer that the seller has the right to transfer ownership and no one else has rights to the property.


   Types of Title Insurance  

There are two types of title insurance: lender’s title insurance and owner’s title insurance (including extended policies). Almost all lenders require the borrower to purchase a lender’s title insurance policy to protect the lender in the event that the seller was not legally able to transfer the title of ownership rights. A lender’s policy only protects the lender against loss. An issued policy signifies the completion of a title search, offering some assurance to the buyer.



Since title searches are not infallible and the owner remains at risk of financial loss, there is a need for additional protection in the form of an owner’s title insurance policy. While lender’s title insurance is required for you to get your mortgage loan, owner’s title insurance, which is purchased by the seller to protect the buyer against defects in the title, is optional.



You might consider owner’s title insurance once you own your home since, as you continue to pay down your mortgage, you now own a greater percentage of your property. As a result, you have more to lose if a claim comes up. This is especially important if you plan on spending a long period of time in your home.


   Purchasing Title Insurance  

An escrow or closing agent initiates the insurance process upon completion of the property purchase agreement. There are four major U.S. title insurance underwriters: Fidelity National Financial Inc., First American Title Insurance Co., Old Republic National Title Insurance Co., and Stewart Title Guaranty Co. There are also regional title insurance companies from which to choose.



The cost of owner’s title insurance ranges from $500 to $3,500, depending on the state where you live, the insurance provider you choose, and the purchase price of your home.



Often, a lender’s policy and an owner’s policy are required together to guarantee that everyone is adequately protected. At closing, the parties purchase title insurance for a one-time fee. The Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act (RESPA) prohibits sellers from requiring purchase from a specific title insurance carrier to prevent abuse.






While your lender, lawyer, or real estate agent may recommend a title insurance company, it’s always a good idea to comparison shop.


   Risks of Not Having Title Insurance  

Having no title insurance exposes transacting parties to significant risk in the event that a title defect is present. Consider a homebuyer searching for the house of their dreams only to find, after closing, unpaid property taxes from the prior owner. Without title insurance, the financial burden of this claim for back taxes rests solely with the buyer. They will either pay the outstanding property taxes or risk losing the home to the taxing entity.



Under the same scenario with title insurance, the coverage protects the buyer for as long as they own—or have an interest in—the property.



Similarly, lender’s title insurance covers banks and other mortgage lenders from unrecorded liens, unrecorded access rights, and other defects. In case of a borrower’s default, if there are any issues with the property’s title, a lender would be covered up to the mortgage amount.



Real estate investors should make sure that a property does not have a bad title before proceeding with any purchase. Homes in foreclosure, for example, may have a number of outstanding issues. Buyers may consider purchasing owner’s title insurance to protect themselves against unforeseen claims against the title.

   The Bottom Line  

Title insurance is a type of indemnity insurance that protects the insured from financial loss when there are claims filed against a title, such as outstanding liens, back taxes, and conflicting wills. The two types of title insurance are lender's title insurance and owner's title insurance.



 Lender's title insurance is purchased by the borrower to protect the lender from these claims, and is the most common type of title insurance. Lenders almost always require the borrower to buy lender's title insurance. That's because the risk of not having this type of coverage is too great, leaving the buyer potentially vulnerable to financial risk if there's a problem with the title. Owner's title insurance is usually bought by the seller to protect the buyer against defects in the title, and is less frequently purchased.
What Is a Title Search?  

The term title search refers to the examination of public records to determine and confirm a property's legal ownership. Title searches are conducted through many sources, including deeds, tax liens, land records, court judgments, among others. Normally conducted by title companies, searches can be ordered by individuals and businesses at any time to find out what, if any, claims or liens are on the property in question. A clean title is required for any real estate transaction to be completed. Transactions cannot be completed if a title search determines there is a lien on the property.





Key Takeaways

A title search is a process whereby the ownership and claims on a piece of real property are evaluated before a real estate transaction is completed.Title searches are normally done by title search companies, but they can also be done by individuals and businesses. The title of a property must be clean for most real estate transactions to go throughA title search involves researching the potential for defects through public records and other sources, such as country courthouses and clerks' offices. Title insurance can be purchased to protect against a financial loss that may occur if a title is found to have issues.


   How Title Searches Work  

As noted above, a title search determines whether there is a clean title on a piece of property or whether there are liens or other defects, such as public record errors, which prevent it from being transferred between parties. The process normally takes place for real estate transactions, such as the buying and selling of homes, or for the purchase and sale of automobiles.



A title search is usually performed by a title company or an attorney on behalf of a prospective buyer who may want to make an offer on the property. The process may also be initiated by a lender or other entity to verify property ownership in order to determine whether there are claims or judgments against the property. This process is normally conducted before approving a loan or other credit that uses that property as collateral.



In order to perform the search, the requesting entity conducts research using public records and legal documents to identify the vested owner, the liens or other judgments on the property, the loans on the property, and the property taxes due.



While it is possible for a prospective buyer or another individual to conduct a title search on their own, it is not generally recommended. Legal documents can be confusing, and gaining access to courthouse records can be a difficult process.






Homeowners who want to refinance their home loans may also choose to conduct a title search.


   Special Considerations  

An attorney or a title company will search public records on a property's ownership before you close a deal on the purchase of a home as a prospective homebuyer. Once the search is finished, you will receive a preliminary title report.



If there are any issues or problems with the title, you can point them out to the seller. Depending on the exact nature of the issue, you can decide whether you want to go through with the purchase of the property.



You will likely want to include your attorney and real estate agent in these discussions. Some problems discovered via a title search are easily cleared up, while others may take so long that they jeopardize your loan commitment.


  Dirty Title vs. Clean Title  

A title search confirms a property's legal ownership and identifies whether there are any claims on the property. While a clean title proves sole ownership of a piece of property or land, a dirty title indicates that there is a cloud of uncertainty or discredit hanging over the property or land.



Erroneous surveys and unresolved building code violations are examples of title search findings that could result in a dirty or defective title designation. For instance, a dirty title may have unknown liens on it. Or a filing clerk at the county office could have misspelled or misapplied some information when it came time to register the title.






In lieu of title insurance, some private transactions can involve a warranty of title, which is a guarantee by a seller to a buyer that the seller has the right to transfer ownership and no one else has rights to the property.


  Title Insurance  

Even a company or professional experienced in conducting title searches can occasionally miss something, or there can be a paperwork error that leads to a document being overlooked. Mistakes can happen, and these mistakes can be costly if you discover there’s an issue with the property after you complete the purchase. This is why buyers often purchase title insurance, which can protect you and your mortgage lender from financial loss if a title-related problem arises during or after the sale.



Title insurance protects against loss or damage occurring from liens, encumbrances, or defects in the title or actual ownership of a property. Unlike traditional insurance, which protects against future events, title insurance protects against claims for past occurrences.



A basic owner's title insurance policy typically covers the following hazards:



Ownership by another partyIncorrect signatures on documents, as well as forgery and fraud concerning title documentsDefective recordation (flawed records or record-keeping)Restrictive covenants (terms that reduce value or enjoyment), such as unrecorded easementsEncumbrances or judgments against property, such as outstanding lawsuits or liens


   Example of a Title Search  

Here's a hypothetical example to show how title searches work. Let's assume that you want to move to a bigger home. You've seen a few properties but there's one that piques your interest just a little more than the others. You decide to make an offer.



As the buyer, you want to ensure that the property is free and clear of any liens, encumbrances, and other defects that can prevent you from completing the purchase so you hire a title company to do the work for you.



The title company will take a few steps to determine if the title to your prospective home is clean or defective. This involves gathering legal documents relevant to the property by scouring through public records as well as going to courthouses and county offices. The company amasses all the information it finds to you.



You can go through with the transaction if the title is clear. But if there are any defects, the transaction cannot be completed. Some defects may be easier to clear up than others, such as clerical errors versus liens against the home.




How Do You Do a Title Search?
Title searches are normally conducted using a title company. This company is responsible for searching through public records to see if there are any liens against a property. The company is commonly hired during the sale and purchase of a home and may also assist in the closing process. Individuals can also conduct title searches on their own by going through public records online or in person through a county clerk's or tax assessor's office.




How Long Does a Title Search Take to Complete?
The average title search can take anywhere between 10 and 14 days to complete. But it may take longer for title searches to be executed on older properties.




Can Someone Do a Title Search on Their Own?
Title searches are normally done by title companies. But you can certainly do a title search on your own. Before you start, make sure you have the correct information, such as the street and legal address of the property. Once you have this information, check through public records online or in person. You can go to the office where the title is recorded (usually the country clerk's office) and/or the tax assessor's office to see if there are any outstanding liens on the property. Keep in mind that it can be a long and tedious process. It can also be costly, too.




What Does a Title Search Tell Me?
A title search tells you the name of the legal owner of a property and if there are any outstanding claims or liens against the property. Liens may be filed by lenders and other financial institutions, contractors, tax collectors, and any other entity that has a financial and legal claim against the property.
What Is to Be Announced (TBA)?  

To be announced, or TBA in bond trading, is a term that describes forward-settling of mortgage-backed securities (MBS) trades. Pass-through securities issued by Freddie Mac, Fannie Mae, and Ginnie Mae trade in the TBA market, and the term TBA is derived from the fact that the actual mortgage-backed security that will be delivered to fulfill a TBA trade is not designated at the time the trade is made. These securities are announced 48 hours prior to the established trade settlement date.



TBA may also be used to denote a pending corporate announcement or other pieces of information that is yet "to be determined" (TBD).





Key Takeaways

TBA is a term taken from the selling of mortgage-backed securities, where the details were not known until later.TBA is used to better facilitate trades in the MBS market and provide liquidity, allowing mortgage lenders to hedge their origination pipelines.A TBA trade does not include all of its details, so it is best left to professionals who understand the nuances of TBA trades.Due to their nature, TBAs can sometimes carry considerate risk.TBA is sometimes used interchangeable with TBD ("to be determined")


   Understanding TBA  

A TBA serves as a contract to purchase or sell an MBS on a specific date, but it does not include information regarding the pool number, number of pools, or the exact amount that will be included in the transaction. An MBS is a bond that is secured, or backed, by mortgage loans. Loans with similar traits are grouped together to form a pool, and that pool is subsequently sold to stand as collateral for the associated MBS.



Interest and principal payments are issued to investors at a rate based on the principal and interest payments made by the borrowers of the associated mortgages. Investors receive interest payments on a monthly basis instead of semiannually.






The settlement procedures of MBS-TBA trades are established by the Bond Market Association.



This is because the TBA market assumes MBS pools to be relatively interchangeable. The TBA process increases the overall liquidity of the MBS market by taking thousands of different MBSs with different characteristics and trading them through a handful of contracts. The buyers and sellers of TBA trades agree on these parameters: issuer, maturity, coupon, price, par amount, and settlement date.



Each type of agency pass-through security is given a trade settlement date for each month. Trade counterparties are required to exchange pool information by 3 p.m. (EST), 48 hours prior to the established settlement date. Trades are allocated in $1 million lots.






The TBA market is the second most traded secondary market after the U.S. Treasury market.


   Special Considerations: TBA Trade Risks  

Due to the forward-settling nature of the investment, the risk of counterparty default is present during the period of time between the execution of the trade and the actual settlement. The risk associated with this form of default is that, especially in highly volatile markets, the non-defaulting party will be unable to secure a deal with similar terms once the defaulting party’s intentions are known. Risk may be mitigated through the assignment of collateral to the transaction, though not all firms have immediate access to collateral management services.



In January 2014, when average daily trading volumes in the TBA market were reaching over $186 billion, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) set margin requirements designed to assist in lowering risks for TBA transactions with longer settlement dates. This rule only applies to specific individuals or institutions and is not deemed necessary for transactions with short settlement periods.


   Other Uses of TBA  

"To be announced" can refer to other circumstances that do not involve bond markets. In these cases, TBA is most often used interchangeably with TBD, or "to be determined." Whenever there is upcoming information scheduled for release, but the exact time or date has not been set, it may appear as "TBA". For instance, a company may set its annual shareholders' meeting for sometime in the Spring of the following year, with the exact date and location TBA until it has been finalized.



Similarly, "TBA" can be used as a placeholder for dates or other information yet to be determined for purposes of shipping and logistics, pending news headlines, or personnel changes. For instance, a company may wish to hire a new manager, with the successful candidate TBA after negotiations have been concluded.


   Frequently Asked Questions  
  Does TBA mean something different in finance?  

In the world of bond trading, TBA is used in particular to describe a situation when certain mortgage-backed securities are traded but the details of the securities are not announced until a later point in time. Buyers and sellers of TBA trades agree on a few necessary parameters such as issuer maturity, coupon, price, par amount, and settlement date. The specific securities involved in the trade are announced 48 hours before the settlement.


  What is the difference between TBA and TBD?  

Outside of the MBS market, 'to be announced' and 'to be determined' are often used interchangeably and mean the same thing. More technically, TBA (i.e., a pending announcement) should occur after something has already been determined, so that it will always follow a TBD status. For instance, a company may ponder whether to acquire a company—rendering it TBD. Once that decision has been approved, the status may move to TBA until it has been officially announced to shareholders.


  When are MBS trades described as TBA?  

A to-be-announced (TBA) trade is effectively a contract to buy or sell mortgage-backed securities (MBS) on a specific date. It does not include information regarding the pool number, the number of pools, or the exact amount involved in the transaction, which means the underlying mortgages are not known to the parties. This exclusion of data is due to the TBA market assuming that MBS pools are more or less interchangeable. This interchangeability helps facilitate trading and liquidity.
What Is a Tobacco Tax/Cigarette Tax?  

A tobacco or cigarette tax is a tax imposed on all tobacco products by various levels of government, often with the alleged goal of reducing tobacco use or at least generating revenues earmarked to fund related healthcare programs. The terms "Tobacco Tax" and "Cigarette Tax" are used interchangeably. 





Key Takeaways

A tobacco tax or cigarette tax is a tax imposed on tobacco products, with the state goal of reducing tobacco use and its related harms.Due to the price inelasticity of demand for addictive products such as tobacco, these taxes have a relatively small effect in reducing tobacco use.Because they generate substantial revenues, tobacco taxes can easily lead to perverse fiscal incentives and the encouragement of ongoing tobacco consumption.


   Understanding Tobacco Tax/Cigarette Taxes  

In the U.S. and other countries, federal, state, and local governments impose a tax on some or all tobacco products. Types of tobacco products include cigarettes, pipe tobacco, cigars, hookah/shisha tobacco, snuff, etc.



Excise taxes are usually levied on the sale and production for sale of tobacco products, resulting in the price offered to buyers being higher relative to the cost of other goods and services. Producers, manufacturers, and wholesalers pay the excise tax and, in a bid to recover the tax paid on these products, raise the sale price to the final consumers. Taxes may also take the form of a sales tax, value-added tax (VAT), or duty tax, with consumers, once again, mainly responsible for footing a portion or all of these bills.



Tax authorities often slap high taxes on what they consider to be morally objectionable vices such as tobacco and alcohol. The idea is to punish consumers and hopefully discourage them from continuing the activity.



These efforts aren't always successful, though. Because demand for tobacco, and many other sin-taxed goods, is known to be highly price inelastic, most of the effect of the tax tends to be reflected in price increases rather than reduced consumption, at least in the short-run. 


   Limitations of Tobacco Tax/Cigarette Taxes  

The World Health Organization (WHO) admits that, on average, a 10% increase in price (including taxes) of tobacco products would account for only a 4 to 5% drop in cigarette demand. These estimates may be generous, and most independent research finds much smaller effects. The Center for Tobacco Control Research and Education, for example, points out that cigarette taxes are among the least effective means to reduce smoking. 



Since smoking is an addictive habit, increasing the price of tobacco products﻿﻿ does little to curb the number of sales made. Instead, most tobacco consumers simply pay the higher price (including the tax) and continue smoking. 



This often results in a large revenue windfall for the taxing authority—or for organized crime groups that smuggle in untaxed products—but a comparatively small effect on actually reducing tobacco consumption. In some cases, this may even create incentives for governments to at least tolerate—if not encourage—tobacco use, as it becomes a major cash cow for general spending budgets. 


   Advantages and Disadvantages of Tobacco Tax/Cigarette Taxes  

On one hand, it could be argued that increased tax revenues from smoking is a good thing as it boosts the amount of money to spend on improving public services. It's also reasonable to suggest that this extra capital can go to funding healthcare programs and, specifically, covering the expenses of treating sick smokers, who controversially cost the state hundreds of billions of dollars a year.



Still, tobacco or cigarette tax isn't without controversy. Often it can lead to the perverse incentive phenomenon of “bootleggers-and-baptists”, first described by economist Bruce Yandle, where an effective political coalition of moral crusaders and economic beneficiaries can effectively push for increasing tobacco taxes, regardless of whether the tax is actually effective at its ostensible goal of reducing tobacco use.



This can especially be the case when some or all tobacco tax revenue is earmarked for specific spending, such as healthcare or schools, thereby creating a concentrated interest group that benefits from ongoing tobacco revenue.
What Is the Tobin Tax?  

The Tobin tax is a tax levied on spot currency conversions, with the intention of disincentivizing short-term currency speculation, named after economist James Tobin.



In contrast to a consumption tax paid by consumers, the Tobin tax is meant to apply to financial sector participants as a means of controlling the stability of a given country's currency. It is more formally known today as a Financial Transactions Tax (FTT), or less formally a Robin Hood tax.





Key Takeaways

The Tobin tax is a duty proposed on spot currency trades to penalize short-term currency trading in order to stabilize markets and disincentive speculation.The Tobin tax can be used to generate revenue streams for countries that see a great deal of short-term currency movement.The Tobin tax is sometimes referred to as the Robin Hood tax, as many see it as a way for governments to take small amounts of money from the people making large, short-term currency exchanges.


   Understanding the Tobin Tax  

When fixed exchange rates under the Breton Woods system were replaced with flexible exchange rates in 1971, there was a massive movement of funds between different currencies that threatened to destabilize the economy. In addition, the rise in short-term currency speculation encouraged by the nature of the free currency market increased the economic costs incurred by countries exchanging currencies.



The Tobin tax, proposed by James Tobin in 1972, seeks to mitigate or eliminate these issues. The tax has been adopted by a number of European countries and the European Commission to discourage short-term currency speculation and stabilize currency markets.



The currency transactions tax does not impact long-term investments. It is only imposed on the excessive flow of money that moves regularly between financial markets through the actions of speculators in search of high short-term interest rates. The tax is paid by banks and financial institutions that profit from market volatility by taking excessive short-term speculative positions in the currency markets.






The Tobin tax was originally introduced by American economist James Tobin (1918-2002), recipient of the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics in 1981.



According to Tobin, to work effectively such a tax should be adopted internationally and be uniform, and the proceeds donated to developing countries. Although Tobin suggested a rate of 0.5%, other economists have put forward rates ranging from 0.1% to 1%. But even at a low rate, if every financial transaction taking place globally was subject to the tax, billions in revenue could be raised.



The original intent of imposing the Tobin tax has been skewed over the years by different countries implementing it. While Tobin’s proposed tax on currency exchanges was intended to curb destabilizing capital flows across borders which makes it difficult for countries to implement independent monetary policies by moving money quickly back and forth between countries with different interest rates, some countries now impose the Tobin tax as a means of generating revenue for economic and social development.


   Example of the Tobin Tax  

For example, in 2013, Italy adopted the Tobin tax not because it was faced with exchange rate instability, but because it was facing a debt crisis, an uncompetitive economy, and a weak banking sector. By extending its currency transaction tax to high-frequency trading (HFT), the Italian government sought to stabilize markets, reduce financial speculation, and raise revenue.



The Tobin tax has been controversial since its introduction. Opponents of the tax indicate it would eliminate any profit potential for currency markets as it is likely to decrease the volume of financial transactions, slowing global economic growth and development in the long run. Proponents state that the tax would help stabilize currency and interest rates because many countries' central banks do not have the cash in reserve that would be needed to balance a currency selloff.
What Is the Tokyo Price Index (TOPIX)?  

The Tokyo Price Index—commonly referred to as TOPIX—is a metric for stock prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE). TOPIX is a capitalization-weighted index that lists all firms in the "first section" of the TSE, a section that organizes all large firms on the exchange into one group. The second section of the TSE pools all of the smaller remaining companies.





Key Takeaways

The Tokyo Price Index, known as TOPIX, is a Japanese stock market index calculated and published by the Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE).TOPIX tracks domestic companies in the exchange’s first section, which represents Japan's largest firms by market capitalization.Another Japanese stock index is the Nikkei, which is a price-weighted index comprised of the top 225 blue chip companies traded on the TSE.While investors cannot directly purchase an index, there are several exchange traded funds (ETFs)—such as the TOPIX Core 30 ETF—that enable investors to invest in a basket of securities that tracks the performance of the TOPIX.


   Understanding the Tokyo Price Index (TOPIX)  

The Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE) is the largest stock exchange in Japan and is responsible for calculating and publishing the TOPIX. Compared to the Nikkei, or Japan's Nikkei 225 Stock Average, the TOPIX is considered a more appropriate representation of all the Japanese stock markets because it reflects a fairer depiction of price changes and includes the largest companies trading on the TSE. In comparison, the Nikkei is weighted by price and is composed of only the top 225 blue chip companies listed on the TSE.


   The Sector Indices of TOPIX  

TOPIX shows the current market capitalization of companies assuming that market capitalization as of the base date (Jan. 4, 1968) is 100 points. The measure is used to determine the overall trend in the stock market and is used as a benchmark for investors.



The sector indices of TOPIX are composed of indices created by dividing the constituents of TOPIX into 33 categories. These categories are determined according to the industrial sectors defined by the Securities Identification Code Committee. They include but are not limited to, construction, textiles and apparels, nonferrous metals, machinery, electric power and gas, land and air transportation, retail trade, banks, securities and commodity futures, real estate, insurance, agriculture and forestry, pharmaceuticals, and iron and steel.



TOPIX has some subindices that are also published by the TSE. These include but are not limited to, the TOPIX New Index Series, size-based TOPIX subindices, TOPIX sector indices, the Tokyo Stock Exchange Composite Index Series, the Tokyo Stock Exchange Dividend Focus 100 Index, the Tokyo Stock Exchange REIT Property Sector Index Series, and the Tokyo Stock Exchange Mothers Index.


   TOPIX as Free Float Index  

In a series of three phases, TOPIX transitioned from a system that weighted companies based on a collective total figure of outstanding shares to a system that weights companies based on the total number of shares available for trade. This is known as a free float. TOPIX’s transition began in 2005 and was completed in the summer of 2006.



Although this transition is, essentially, a technicality, it has had a substantial impact on the actual weight of companies listed in the index. This is because a large majority of companies in Japan also have significant holdings of shares in their business partners to maintain sophisticated and strong business alliances, and these shares are no longer included in the index's company weight calculation.






The Japanese practice of business partners having close relationships with one another and sometimes taking equity stakes in each other is called keiretsu, which translated literally means "headless combine."


   Special Considerations  

One of several TOPIX indices is the TOPIX Core 30 Index. The capitalization-weighted index tracks the performance of 30 stocks in the TOPIX index that have large market capitalizations and are the most liquid. The index started on April 1, 1998 with a base value of 1,000. The list of companies in the TOPIX Core 30 include some of Japan's most well-known names, such as Honda Motor, Canon, Mitsubishi Corp., Sony, and Toyota Motor.



Investors cannot directly purchase an index. However, there are exchange traded funds (ETFs) that enable investors to invest in a basket of securities that tracks the performance of the TOPIX. The Nomura Asset Management Company runs the TOPIX Core 30 Exchange Traded Fund (ETF). The fund's investment objective is to construct a portfolio that is similar in composition to the TOPIX Core 30, providing corresponding price and yield performance.
What Is a Tombstone?  

A tombstone is a written advertisement of a public offering placed by investment bankers who are underwriting the issue. It gives basic details about the issue and lists each of the underwriting groups involved in the deal. The tombstone provides investors with some general information and directs the prospective investors to a link where they can obtain a prospectus.





Key Takeaways

A tombstone is a written advertisement that gives investors basic details about an upcoming public offering.A public offering is when a company offers to sell equity shares in the company in order to raise money.The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) requires companies to publish advertisements as part of the disclosure requirements before issuing new shares of stock.The tombstone ad describes the type and number of securities offered, how they can be purchased, the availability date, the security's credit rating, and the names of the syndicate members authorized to sell the security.The tombstone gets its unusual name from the black border and heavy black type that typically appears on the print advertisement, which some say resembles a gravestone marker.


   How a Tombstone Works  

In order to raise money, a company's management can sell equity shares in the company through a public offering. A tombstone is one component of the disclosure requirements for security offerings required by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The tombstone is simply an announcement that securities are available for sale.


   Tombstone Ad vs. Prospectus  

While a tombstone ad is just a brief announcement alerting investors to the upcoming security sale, a prospectus goes into greater detail and gives investors the information they need to make an investing decision. When a company issues securities to the public, the SEC requires that each investor receive a prospectus. The prospectus requirement applies to an initial public offering (IPO), which refers to the first time an issuer sells any type of security to the general public.



The prospectus requirement also applies to all seasoned issues, A seasoned issue, also known as a secondary offering, is when an established company that already trades on the stock exchange issues new shares of stock for sale. A tombstone for a secondary offering is mailed to all investors who already own the security, and all secondary offerings are sold using a prospectus.






The preliminary prospectus doesn't include price information, but is used to gauge market interest in the security being proposed; the final prospectus, however, includes price information as well as the number of shares the company will sell.


   The Role of Underwriters  

An underwriter is responsible for managing the legal and accounting process of creating a prospectus. The prospectus includes the issuer's most recent set of audited financial statements, as well as a legal opinion regarding the existence of any pending legal matters.



A prospectus goes into great detail about a firm's marketing, production, and sales process, and it explains why the company is raising more capital. In addition to the underwriters, there may be many other members of the syndicate who are brought in to sell the securities to their customers. The underwriter's sales force also sells the newly issued securities.


   Examples of Tombstone Information  

The tombstone describes the types of securities that are offered, the date they are available, the number of shares or bonds to be sold, and how the securities can be purchased. If a new debt security receives a credit rating, that rating can be included in the tombstone.



A tombstone advertisement gets its name from the black border and heavy black print one typically has in print media. The tombstone lists the syndicate members who are involved in the underwriting of the security, with the primary members listed in larger type at the top of the advertisement.



A syndicate member's level of involvement is based on the work the member performs on the security offering and the percentage of the total issue that the member's firm sells to the public. If a syndicate member is listed at the top of a tombstone for a popular issuer of stock, that document helps the syndicate firm market its expertise to other companies.
What Is Tomorrow Next (Tom Next)?  

Tomorrow next (tom next) is a short-term foreign exchange (forex) transaction where a currency is simultaneously bought and sold over two separate business days: those being tomorrow (in one business day) and the following day (two business days from today).



The point of a tom next transaction is to allow traders and investors to maintain their position without being forced to take physical delivery. Tom next transactions are also important in commodities derivatives markets, although this terminology is not often used there.





Key Takeaways

Tomorrow next refers to the rolling over of a position in the currency markets to postpone delivery.A trader can roll over their position to the next and next (i.e., two days later) business days to avoid taking delivery and holding onto the currency at the same time.A tom next transaction can be executed through a broker's forex or STIR desk.


   Understanding Tomorrow Next (Tom Next)  

In most currency trades, delivery is two days after the transaction date (T+2). Tom-next trades arise because most currency traders have no intention of taking delivery of the currency and so require their positions to be "rolled over" on a daily basis.



This simultaneous transaction is an FX swap, and depending on what currency the person holds, they will either be charged or earn a premium. Those traders and investors holding high-yielding currencies will roll it over at a more favorable rate (minimal) because of the interest rate differential. This differential is known as the cost of carry. 






If the two currencies have identical interest rates then they will be swapped at the same rate. 



The actual transactions of tom-next trades are effected by dealers in the interbank market. Depending on their transaction direction, the trader will either "buy and sell" or "sell and buy" the currency they are rolling over. A tom-next transaction is generally handled by the forwards trading desk or the STIR (short-term interest rate) team.



If a trader chooses not to roll over their position, they will be forced to take physical delivery of that currency. And because this is rarely the case, a tom-next transaction is essentially the extension of a trader's position.






The principle of rolling a position over is perhaps even more important in commodities trading because if it is not done a trader would be required to take delivery of the underlying commodity at expiration.


   Example of Tomorrow Next (Tom Next)  

A trader is long on the EUR/USD pair, which is trading at $1.53 (1 euro buys 1.53 US dollars) on its expiration date. The trader issues a tom-next instruction to continue holding onto the pair. Suppose the swap interest rates for the pair are in the range of 0.010 to 0.015.



At the end of the trading day, after the purchase and sale of shares, the trader is offered an interest rate of 0.010. The new price of the trader's position becomes $1.52 the following day.
What Is a Tontine?  

Tontine is the name of an early system for raising capital in which individuals pay into a common pool of money and receive dividends based on their share of returns from investments made with the pooled money.



As members of the group died, they were not replaced with new investors so the proceeds were divided among fewer and fewer members. The surviving investors profited from the deaths of people they knew, a feature that many considered macabre.





Key Takeaways

Tontine is the name of an early system for raising capital where individuals pay into a common pool of money.In the U.S., tontines were popular in the 1700s and 1800s, then faded in the early 1900s.Tontine investors paid lump sums upon joining and received annual dividend-like payments until death.Shares of a deceased tontine investor were divided among the surviving members, and the shares for remaining members increase as more members die.


   Understanding a Tontine  

Although they seem alien today, tontines have a storied pedigree that reaches back at least half a millennium. The name comes from a 17th-century Italian financier, Lorenzo de Tonti. It is not clear whether he actually invented the tontine, but Tonti did famously pitch a tontine scheme to the French government in the 17th century as a way for King Louis XIV to raise money.



For this reason, historians suggest that Tonti’s idea originated with the financial folkways of his native Italy. The idea didn’t catch on at first, and Tonti eventually landed in the Bastille.



A few decades later, in the late Middle Ages tontines became widespread in Europe as a financing tool for the royal courts. Because levying taxes was often out of the question, European monarchs borrowed, predominantly via tontines, to fund their internecine wars.



At the height of their popularity in the 1900s, tontines represented almost two-thirds of the insurance market in the United States and accounted for more than 7.5% of the nation’s wealth. By 1905, there were an estimated nine million active tontine policies in the U.S., in a country of only 18 million households.






Tontine insurance policies were banned in the United States in 1906.



Despite their popularity, tontines had acquired a bad rap in the U.S. because of several well-publicized insurance scandals; so to some, they remain synonymous with greed and corruption. In Europe, tontines are regulated under Directive 2002/83/EC of the European Parliament, and tontines are still common in France.


   Tontine Process  

As an investor in a tontine, you paid a lump sum upfront—similar to the concept of principal except that it was never paid back—and you received annual "dividend" payments until your death. When an investor died, his shares were divided among the surviving members of the tontine.



In this way, a tontine's characteristics are similar to a group annuity and a lottery. In a tontine, the longer you live—and the fewer fellow investors who remain living—the larger your annual payment. The last investor alive would collect the entire dividend. When all the investors died, the tontine ended, and the government usually absorbed the remaining capital.






In most places in the United States using tontines to raise capital or obtain lifetime income is consistently upheld as being legal; however, outdated legislation in two states has fostered the incorrect perception that selling tontines in the broader U.S. is illegal.


   Tontines in the United States  

In 19th-century America, tontines were a popular vehicle for increasing life insurance sales. Historians generally credit tontines with single-handedly underwriting the insurance industry's ascendance in America. Popular culture served to amplify both the fashionability and the dark side of tontines—as Agatha Christie, Robert Louis Stevenson, and P.G. Wodehouse all wrote stories about tontine participants conspiring to kill one another to claim the big payoff.



 At the beginning of the American Republic, U.S. Treasury Secretary Alexander Hamilton proposed using tontines as a way to reduce the national debt. Hamilton's tontine had an unusual payout structure that froze investor payments to the final beneficiaries when the survivor pool was reduced to 20% of the original group. These beneficiaries would still receive a dividend, but it would no longer increase as their co-beneficiaries died off. Hamilton's tontine proposal was ignored by Congress, however.



As rapidly as their popularity rose in America, tontines' downfall was equally precipitous. Shortly after 1900, several spectacular insurance-industry embezzlement scandals all but wiped the tontine from the U.S. consciousness.


   A Second Glance at Tontines?  

Today, a growing number of financial advisors, academics, and Fintech firms think that it might be time to take a second look at these financial arrangements. One such academic is Moshe Milevsky, an associate professor of finance at York University’s Schulich School of Business in Toronto, who would like to see tontines make a comeback. Milevsky thinks that tontines are attractive because they provide the regular income of an annuity—even more income for living members—and because of tontines’ structure and relatively low costs, they produce higher yields than annuities.



Tontines may also offer a solution to longevity risk—the danger that you’ll outlive your money. Moreover, advocates say that with automation and developments like blockchain technology, today’s tontines could boast something that was missing in previous versions: transparency and, with that, less possibility of fraud. The market for tontines is as large as for life insurance, especially with baby boomers looking for an alternative to their vanished pensions.



So, instead of something that belongs hidden in the pages of a murder mystery, a modern version of the tontine could be a viable way for people to finance their final years. Tontines could even provide a safer and more affordable way for American companies to revive the pension. Interestingly, some believe that the fall of the American tontine in the early 20th century had a lot to do with the rise of the corporate pension. As Milevsky told The Washington Post in 2015, “This [tontines] might be the iPhone of retirement products.”



Today, most people do not rely on pensions to fund their retirement nor are they abundantly investing in traditional retirement accounts, such as annuities, to supplement retirement income. Often, retirees are dependent on their insufficient life savings and nominal Social Security payments. These factors have many wondering what alternatives exist to help.



Annuities' popularity has dwindled over the years as people fear they will not realize a return on their investment before death. Tontines shift the focus from one's morbidity to the morbidity of the group members—an easier scenario to digest. In addition, tontines have fewer fees, resulting in higher payouts to participants. Although payments are not fixed like annuities, they will not decrease.



Reduced costs and the potential for higher payments throughout retirement are attractive features that have some rethinking of whether tontines should be revived. At least, some proponents argue that people should have the option of participating in one.


   Real-World Examples  

Tontines often took the form of subscriptions, the proceeds of which were used to fund private- or public-works projects, which sometimes featured the tontine in their name.


  The First Freemasons' Hall, London, 1775  

In 1775, English freemasons used a tontine to finance the first Freemasons’ Hall (the Freemasons’ Tontine) in Great Queen Street, London. Today this building—called the United Grand Lodge of England (UGLE)—houses more than 200,000 member freemasons and is a place for all to gather in fellowship as equals. The public is welcome, and the UGLE offers historical lectures, tours, and other programs. The UGLE also offers this space for rent; and it is a favorite spot for shooting films, conferences, and trade and fashion shows.



Investors in this tontine came primarily from the property-owning, commercial and professional classes; they were largely male, but with a significant number of widows and spinsters. At its inception in 1775, this tontine raised £5,000 ($6,344) at a nominal interest rate of 5% per annum, for an annual dividend of £250 ($317). 



The Freemasons' Tontine was a well-organized business and published a printed prospectus containing the terms of the tontine. It also maintained a register that included the group's written history, and a list of the 100 original subscribers along with detailed demographic data. The Freemasons’ Tontine is unusual in that these records have survived for their 87-year duration (1775–1862).


  The Tontine Hotel in Ironbridge, Shropshire, United Kingdom, 1780  

The Shrewsbury architect, John Hiram Haycock, built the Tontine Hotel (The Tontine) in Ironbridge in 1780 using a tontine to finance its construction. The hotel stands close to the famous Iron Bridge that spans the River Severn, which gives the town its name.



The Iron Bridge, opened in 1781, was the first major bridge in the world to be made of the then-new material, cast iron. A wonder of the industrial age, in 1934 the Iron Bridge was designated as a Scheduled Ancient Monument and closed to vehicular traffic; and in 1986, the bridge was declared a World Heritage Site.



The Tontine Hotel's sole original purpose was to accommodate the many tourists who came to see the Iron Bridge. The Tontine was also used frequently as a meeting place for local industrialists and businessmen.



Today, the Tontine Hotel is still a vital meeting place for travelers, tourists, and businessmen. In addition to a bar and restaurant, The Tontine offers high-quality bed and breakfast accommodations in Shropshire, about a 30-minute drive from both Shrewsbury and Wolverhampton. The center of Ironbridge is less than a five-minute walk from the hotel. The Tontine seems not to have inherited any ghoulish associations with the tontine operations of old, as it is a favorite spot for couples and families alike.


  The Tontine Coffee House, New York City, 1793  

The New York Stock Exchange has roots that go back to a spring day in 1792 when a group of 24 men met outside of 68 Wall Street (at Water Street) in the shade of a huge sycamore, or "buttonwood tree." They set down the rules they would trade by and called it the Buttonwood Agreement.



Later that year, the financiers moved their trading operations into a room on the second floor of a building that became the Tontine Coffee House. Early in 1793, a tontine, of course, financed the construction of the Tontine Coffee House, by selling 203 shares at $200 each. In 1817, the growth of this tontine's investments had in effect morphed into the Big Board, and it moved to a larger space.



The Tontine Coffee House was one of New York City's busiest hubs for buying and selling stocks, transacting business deals, and holding heated political debates and other forums. In addition to serving as a home for the Merchants Exchange, the Tontine Coffee House was a social gathering spot and a landmark building, which appeared often in the memoirs of illustrious financiers and newspaper stories as the site of important public meetings.



The original building financed by the tontine survived the Great Fire of 1835 but was torn down and replaced in the middle 1850s. The member death that triggered the Tontine Coffee House's dissolution occurred in November 1870, but accounting disputes delayed the proceedings and the property was finally sold at a court-ordered auction in January 1881. The sale brought the city only $138,550, which was much less than anticipated.
What Is Too Big to Fail?  

“Too big to fail” describes a business or business sector so ingrained in a financial system or economy that its failure would be disastrous. The government will consider bailing out a corporate entity or a market sector, such as Wall Street banks or U.S. carmakers, to prevent economic disaster.





Key Takeaways

“Too big to fail” describes a business or sector whose collapse would cause catastrophic economic damage.The U.S. government has intervened with rescue measures where failure poses a risk to the economy.The Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, following the failure of banks during the financial crisis of 2007-2008, included the $700 billion Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP). 


   Financial Institutions  

A bailout of Wall Street banks and other financial institutions deemed "too big to fail" occurred during the global financial crisis of 2007-2008. Following the collapse of Lehman Brothers, Congress passed the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act (EESA) in October 2008.



The rescue measures included the $700 billion Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP), which authorized the U.S. government to purchase distressed assets to stabilize the financial system. Following the assistance, regulations under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 were imposed on financial institutions.






“Too big to fail” became a common phrase during the 2007–2008 financial crisis, which led to financial sector reform in the United States and globally.


   Bank Reform  

Following bank failures in the 1920s and early 1930s, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. (FDIC) was created to monitor banks, insure customer deposits, and provide Americans with confidence that their savings would be safe. The FDIC insures individual accounts in member banks for up to $250,000 per depositor.



The 21st century saw new challenges for banks, which had developed financial products and risk models that were inconceivable in the 1930s. The 2007–2008 financial crisis exposed unknown consumer and economic risks. 


  Dodd-Frank Act  

Passed in 2010, Dodd-Frank was created to help prevent future bailouts of the financial system. It included new regulations regarding capital requirements, proprietary trading, and consumer lending. Dodd-Frank also imposed higher requirements for banks collectively labeled systemically important financial institutions (SIFIs).


  Global Banking Reform  

The 2007–2008 financial crisis affected banks around the world. Global regulators also implemented reforms, with the majority of new regulations focused on “too big to fail” banks. Examples of global SIFIs include Mizuho, the Bank of China, BNP Paribas, Deutsche Bank, and Credit Suisse. Global bank regulations are led by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, the Bank for International Settlements, and the Financial Stability Board.


   Companies Considered Too Big to Fail  

Banks that the U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed) has said could threaten the stability of the U.S. financial system include:



Bank of America Corp.The Bank of New York Mellon Corp.Citigroup Inc.The Goldman Sachs Group Inc.JPMorgan Chase & Co.Morgan StanleyState Street Corp.Wells Fargo & Co.



Other entities that were deemed as “too big to fail” during the financial crisis of 2007-2008 and required government intervention were:



General Motors (auto company)
AIG (insurance company)
Chrysler (auto company)
Fannie Mae (government-sponsored enterprise (GSE))
Freddie Mac (GSE)
GMAC—now Ally Financial (financial services company)


   Critique of the Too Big to Fail Theory  

Numerous policies and regulations were imposed to prevent future financial disasters and curtail government intervention. The Dodd-Frank Act passed in July 2010 requires banks to limit their risk-taking by holding larger financial reserves. Banks must keep a ratio of higher-quality assets or capital requirements, in the event of distress within the bank or the wider financial system.



The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) addressed the subprime mortgage crisis and implemented mortgage lending practices that make it easier for consumers to understand the terms of a mortgage agreement.



Critics have argued that regulations harm the competitiveness of U.S. firms and contend that regulatory compliance requirements unduly burden community banks and smaller financial institutions that did not play a role in the financial crisis.






In 2018, some provisions of Dodd-Frank were loosened under President Trump with the passage of the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act.




Is 'Too Big to Fail’ a New Concept?
This term was publicized by U.S. Rep. Stewart McKinney (R-Conn.) in a 1984 congressional hearing, discussing the intervention of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. (FDIC) with the Continental Illinois bank. Although the term was previously used, it became more widely known during the global financial crisis of 2007–2008 when Wall Street received a government bailout.




What Protections Mitigate "Too Big To Fail"?
Regulations have been put in place to require systemically important financial institutions to maintain adequate capital and submit to enhanced supervision and resolution regimes.After the 2008 collapse of large financial institutions, policies were enacted, including the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 (EESA) and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010.




How Did the Troubled Assets Relief Program Assist Banks That Were Too Big To Fail?
The EESA established the Troubled Assets Relief Program (TARP) authorizing the Treasury secretary to "purchase, and to make and fund commitments to purchase, troubled assets from any financial institution, on such terms and conditions as are determined by the secretary." Proponents believed vital to minimize the economic damage created by the sub-prime mortgage meltdown.


   The Bottom Line  

To protect the U.S. economy from a disastrous financial failure that might have global repercussions, the government may step in to financially bail out a systemically critical business or an economic sector, such as transportation or the auto industry. During the 2007-2008 global financial crisis, policymakers and regulators in the U.S. deemed some banks and corporations "too big to fail" and provided rescue measures through the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008.
What Is the Top Line?  

The top line is a reference to gross figures reported by a company, such as sales or revenue. It is called the top line because it is displayed at the very top of a company's income statement, and is reserved for the reporting of gross sales or revenue. A company that increases its revenue or sales is said to be generating top-line growth. The opposite of the top line is the bottom line.





Key Takeaways

Top line refers to the gross figures reported by a company, which is primarily revenues or sales.The term "top line" derives its name from the fact that it is the first item on an income statement.The importance of the top line is that it reflects a company's ability to sell its goods or services as well as indicates if a company is growing from one period to the next.The top line is the starting point of an income statement where costs and other items are deducted from it to arrive at net income.The opposite of the top line is the bottom line, which is net income or profits, after all costs, taxes, and other items have been deducted from the top line.

   Understanding the Top Line  

The top line is a record of a company’s revenue that reflects the full sales price of goods or services sold to consumers within the statement period. It is placed at the top of the income statement, as subsequent line items reference an expense or loss that must be deducted from the gross figure.



Expenses can include any payments made in order to support the production of goods or rendering of a service. Capital losses incurred through the sale of a capital asset at a loss can also be deducted. Common expenses include, but are not limited to, the cost of materials required to manufacture the goods that were sold as well as any operating expenses. Applicable taxes are also deducted from this running total.



Once the costs have been subtracted from the top line then a business arrives at its profits, also known as the bottom line.


   Importance of the Top Line  

The top line is one of the most important figures in a company's financial statements. It shows how much business a company does in the specified period. It reflects the pure demand for a company's goods or services without any other effects.



The top line reflects a company's growth by showing if a company is selling more goods or services over time. If it is, revenue will be increasing. If it is not growing or growing but not by the desired amount, it is an indicator to a company that changes need to be made. This can include the marketing strategy, quality of the product, pricing, or the customer's overall engagement with the company.


   Top Line vs. Bottom Line  

The top line is a gross figure of all revenue earned in the statement period, while the bottom line refers to the net figure after taking into account the costs of earning the revenue. The bottom line reflects the net income, which is often listed as the last, or bottom, line on a company's income statement.



The bottom line reflects what remains once all of the necessary expenses have been deducted from the top line, and reflects the amount of profit that was generated during the statement period.



Both the top line and the bottom line are important but they both provide very different insights. The top line is primarily a growth indicator and a company's ability to sell its goods while the bottom line reflects many internal aspects, such as costs, operating expenses, and generally how a company carries out its business.



A company's top line could be strong, generating high revenues, but if its production processes and other variables generate high costs, the bottom line could turn out to be low, indicating minimal profits.


   Special Considerations  

Top line growth refers to an increase in the gross revenue brought into a company and does not necessarily guarantee an increase in profit. Growth in revenue may lead to growth in the bottom line only if it is not offset by increased expenses.



When top line growth is solely related to increased sales due to increased production, the increased costs of production must be deducted from the top line in order to determine the new bottom line.
What Is Top-Down Investing?  

Top-down investing is an investment analysis approach that focuses on the macro factors of the economy, such as GDP, employment, taxation, interest rates, etc. before examining micro factors such as specific sectors or companies.





Key Takeaways

Top-down investing focuses on the macro factors of the economy, such as GDP, before examining micro factors such as specific sectors or companies. Top-down can be contrasted to bottom-up investing, which prioritizes the performance and fundamentals of individual companies before going to macro factors. Top-down investing can help investors economize on the time and attention they have to bring to bear on their investments, but can also miss out on potentially profitable individual investments. 


   Understanding Top-Down Investing  

Top-down investing prioritizes macroeconomic, national, or market-level factors. It can be contrasted with the bottom-up approach, which starts first with a company's fundamentals, where most of the emphasis is put, and then works its way up through the structural hierarchy, looking at macro-global economic factors last, if at all.



When looking at the bigger picture, investors use macroeconomic variables, such as GDP, trade balances, currency movements, inflation, interest rates, and other aspects of the economy. After looking at the big-picture conditions around the world, analysts next examine the general market conditions to identify high-performing sectors, industries, or regions within the macroeconomy. The goal is to find particular industrial sectors that are forecast to outperform the market.



Based on these factors, top-down investors allocate investments to outperforming economic regions rather than betting on specific companies. For example, if economic growth in Asia is better than the domestic growth in the United States, an investor might shift their assets internationally by purchasing exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that track specific Asian countries. From this point, they can drill down into specific companies to choose potentially successful ones as investments by looking last at their fundamentals.



Top-down investing can make more efficient use of an investor’s time by looking at large-scale economic aggregates before choosing regions or sectors and then specific companies as opposed to starting out with the entire universe of individual companies' stocks. However, it may also miss out on a large number of potentially profitable opportunities by eliminating specific companies that outperform the general market. 


   Top-Down vs. Bottom-Up  

Bottom-up investing is the opposite strategy to top-down. Practitioners of the bottom-up approach ignore macroeconomic factors and instead look at microeconomic factors that affect specific companies they're watching.



Top-down investing may produce a more long-term strategic portfolio and favor passive indexing strategies, while a bottom-up approach may lead to more tactical, actively-managed strategies. Top-down portfolios often consist largely of index funds that track specific regions or industrial sectors and may include commodities, currencies, and some individual stocks. Bottom-up style portfolios often have a much larger share of individual stocks. 



For example, a bottom-up investor chooses a company and then looks at its financial health, supply, demand, and other factors over a specified time period. Although there is some debate as to whether the top-down approach is better than the bottom-up strategy, many investors have found top-down strategies useful in determining the most promising sectors in a given market.


   Top-Down Investing Example  

As an example of top-down investing, UBS Group AG (UBS) hosted its 2016 UBS CIO Global Forum in Beverly Hills, CA, to help investors navigate the economic environment at the time. The forum addressed macroeconomic factors that affect markets, including international government policy, central bank policy, international market performance, and the effects of the Brexit vote on the global economy. The way in which UBS addressed these economic factors points to a top-down investment strategy.



Jeremy Zirin, a wealth manager who is part of UBS Wealth Management Americas, reflected on the benefits of top-down investing at the forum. Consumer discretionary stocks looked attractive to Zirin and his team, who implemented a top-down approach to identify strong consumer discretionary investments. His team took into account the above macroeconomic factors and saw that consumer discretionary was insulated from international risks and was bolstered by American consumers' spending power. Identifying this sector allowed him and his team ultimately to identify Home Depot (HD) as a good investment.

What is the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX)?  

The term Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX) refers to a Canadian stock exchange located in Toronto, Ontario. Founded in 1861, the TSX is Canada's premier stock exchange with more than 1,500 listed companies, including those from the energy, mining, technology, and real estate sectors. The exchange is also home to international listings and exchange-traded products. It became fully electronic after closing its trading floor in 1997. In 2007, the TSX merged with the Montreal Exchange (MX) to form the TMX Group.





Key Takeaways

The Toronto Stock Exchange is the largest exchange in Canada. The exchange is fully electronic with more than 1,500 companies listed. All transactions are conducted in Canadian dollars. The TSX is owned by TMX Group, which also owns the Montreal Exchange, the TSX Venture Exchange, and the Canadian Derivates Clearing Corporation.


   Understanding the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSX)  

The Toronto Stock Exchange is one of the largest stock exchanges in the world and is the third-largest in North America after the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and the Nasdaq. The exchange's history dates back to the mid-1800s. It was established in 1861 and was officially incorporated in 1878 under the name Toronto Stock Exchange or TSE. It became known as the TSX after the company was rebranded in 2002.



The exchange operates Monday to Friday, except for statutory holidays. The market opens with regular trading activity taking place between 9:30 a.m. ET and 4:00 p.m. ET. Trading orders may be entered but not executed during the pre-open between 7:00 a.m. and 9:30 a.m. ET.



As noted above, the exchange eliminated its trading floor in 1997. Trades on the TSX became electronic, similar to the Nasdaq in the United States. Traded instruments include shares in companies, investment trusts, and exchange-traded products (ETPs). Other financial instruments such as bonds, commodities, futures, options, and other derivative products are also actively traded. All transactions are executed in the Canadian dollar. According to the 2020 Guide to Listing, there were 1,572 listed issuers on the exchange.



The exchange launched the TSE 300 Composite Index in 1977, which was similar to the S&P 500. Composed of the most influential stocks on the exchange, the name of the index was changed to the S&P/TSX Composite Index in 2002. The index is rebalanced on a quarterly basis in March, June, September, and December.

   Special Considerations  

In 1999, the TSX became Canada's only exchange for senior equities. Two years later, it acquired the TSX Venture Exchange, which primarily lists small-cap stocks. As noted above, the exchange is now operated by the TMX Group, a result of the merger between the TSX and the MX. In addition to the TSX, the MX, and the TSX Venture Exchange, the group also operates the TSX Alpha Exchange, Shorcan, which specializes in fixed-income products in Canada, and the Canadian Derivates Clearing Corporation (CDCC). The CDCC facilitates the clearing of Canadian exchange-traded derivative products and other financial instruments.



The TSX and the London Stock Exchange (LSE) explored the opportunity for a merger. The deal fell through in 2011 after it failed to receive the required two-thirds majority of votes from shareholders. TMX proposed the merger to avoid a takeover by Maple Group Acquisition Corporation, a consortium of Canadian investors including the Canadian Plan Investment Board, Scotia Capital, and TD Securities. The TMX Group agreed to the Maple Group takeover, which was completed in 2012.
What Is Tort Law?  

Tort law is the area of the law that covers most civil suits. In general, any claim that arises in civil court, with the exception of contractual disputes, falls under tort law.



The concept of tort law is to redress a wrong done to a person and provide relief from the wrongful acts of others, usually by awarding monetary damages as compensation. The original intent of tort is to provide full compensation for proved harms.



Lawsuits involving contracts fall under contract law.



Tort law requires those who are found to be at fault for harming others to compensate the victims. Typical harms include the loss of past or future income, payment of medical expenses, and payment for pain and suffering. There may also be additional punitive damages that are meant to punish the plaintiff in excess of full compensation.





Key Takeaways

Tort law is the branch of the law that deals with civil suits, with the exception of disputes involving contracts.Tort law is considered to be a form of restorative justice since it seeks to remedy losses or injury by providing monetary compensation.There are three main categories of tort law, including suits alleging negligence, intentional harm, and strict liability.






   Understanding Tort Law  

Tort law can be split into three categories: negligent torts, intentional torts, and strict liability torts.



Negligent torts are harms done to people through the failure of another to exercise a certain level of care, usually defined as a reasonable standard of care. Accidents are a standard example of negligent torts.
Intentional torts are harms that have been caused by the willful misconduct of another, such as assault, fraud, and theft.
Strict liability torts, unlike negligence and intentional torts, are not concerned with the culpability of the person doing the harm. Instead, such cases focus on the act itself. If someone or some entity commits a certain act—for example, producing a defective product—that person or company is responsible for the damage done, regardless of the level of care exercised or their intentions.


   Examples of Tort Law  
  A Liability Case  

In February 2016, a self-driving car made by Google crashed into a bus in Mountain View, Calif. The car sensed a group of sandbags positioned around a storm drain and swerved into another lane to avoid them, slamming into the side of a public transit bus. This was the first reported case of a self-driving car causing an accident, not just being a part of one.



According to liability tort law, drivers can seek compensation from a manufacturer for a faulty part of a car, usually an airbag or a tire. However, this liability tort now extends to self-driving cars, and Google and others in the nascent self-driving vehicle business could be found liable for the damages.


  A Negligence Case  

Amy Williams filed a negligence lawsuit against Quest Diagnostics and its subsidiary Athena Diagnostics for the wrongful death of her two-year-old son, Christian Millare.



In 2007, Athena Diagnostics misclassified a mutation in Millare's gene. The plaintiff argued that the misclassification led the child's doctors to use the wrong treatment for his symptoms. The mutation directly resulted in his seizure and death in 2008.



In 2018, 11 years after the child's death, the South Carolina Supreme Court ruled that a genetic testing lab could be classified as a healthcare provider under state law.


  An Intentional Tort Case  

An example of an intentional tort is the ruling between the website Gawker and pro wrestler Hulk Hogan on March 18, 2016.



Hogan was awarded $140 million in damages since it was deemed that Gawker intentionally invaded his privacy in order to obtain video evidence of a private act.


   Tort Reform  

The issue of tort reform relates to the critical stance taken against many tort cases, especially in the United States. Proponents of tort reform argue that many lawsuits today are frivolous.



According to the Court Statistics Project, approximately 11.7 million civil lawsuits were filed in state trial courts in the United States in 2020, and advocates of tort reform claim that far too many of these are based on flimsy grounds, or are filed to intimidate or influence outcomes.



These frivolous cases are expensive and time-consuming, using up public resources that could be better expended elsewhere.



Advocates of tort reform in the U.S. have especially focused on lawsuits related to medical malpractice claims and allegations of billing overcharges, including the unnecessary use of costly medical tests and the high price of drugs due to patents.
What Is a Total Bond Fund?  

A total bond fund is a mutual fund or exchange-traded fund that seeks to replicate a broad bond index. A total bond fund owns many securities across a range of maturities, from both public and private sectors. The most common index used as a benchmark is the Barclays Aggregate Bond Index, which captures Treasury bonds, corporate bonds, municipal bonds and high-grade mortgage-backed securities.





Key Takeaways

A total bond fund tracks the performance of its underlying index, which in turn monitors the entire bond market.Investing in a total bond fund gives investors the same exposure to the bond market as more traditional bond investments allow, but offer a very liquid option in what is traditionally a very illiquid sector.In order for total bond funds to work, they need to have a similar maturity to the bonds in the underlying index. One of the most popular total bond funds is offered by Vanguard, and is called the Vanguard Total Bond Market Index Fund.


   How a Total Bond Fund Works  

Total bond funds may invest in bonds of similar maturity, class, and rating to replicate an issue that is not available for purchase by the fund. These restrictions exist because of the diversity and relative illiquidity of the bond markets compared with equities markets. It is important for a total bond fund to have a similar interest rate and maturity to the base index.



Total bond fund portfolios actually have a bit more freedom in their security selection than a total stock fund does. Because individual bond issues have less liquidity than stocks, some funds have to bypass certain issues that are in the benchmark index while choosing other bonds that are not in the index.



Many total bond funds have a small allocation, around 20% of assets, from which bonds can be chosen at the discretion of the managers and held in assets outside the Barclays Index, such as international bonds, derivatives and lower-rated corporate paper. This allows fund managers a chance to invest in some noncorrelated assets while keeping the overall risk profile of the fund within the same range as the Barclays Index.



The most important risk metrics to keep close to the index are the maturity, or more specifically the weighted average maturity, as well as the duration, or sensitivity to changes in interest rates.


   Vanguard Total Bond Market Index  

The Vanguard Total Bond Market Index is designed to provide broad exposure to U.S. investment-grade bonds. Reflecting this goal, the fund invests about 30% in corporate bonds and 70% in U.S. government bonds of all maturities (short-, intermediate-, and long-term issues). As of June 2022, the fund had a 10-year annualized return of 1.34%.



As with other bond funds, one of the risks of the fund is that increases in interest rates may cause the price of the bonds in the portfolio to decrease—pricing the fund’s NAV lower. Because the fund invests in all segments and maturities of the fixed income market, investors may consider the fund their core bond holding.
What Is Total Cost of Ownership?  

Total cost of ownership (TCO) is the purchase price of an asset plus the costs of operation. Assessing the total cost of ownership means taking a bigger picture look at what the product is and what its value is over time.



When choosing among alternatives in a purchasing decision, buyers often look at an item’s short-term price, known as its purchase price. However they should also consider its long-term price, which is its total cost of ownership. These are the long-term costs and expenses incurred during the product’s useful life and ultimate disposal. The item with the lower total cost of ownership can be the better value in the long run.





Key Takeaways

Total cost of ownership (TCO) includes the purchase price of a particular asset, plus operating costs, over the asset’s life span.Looking at total cost of ownership is a way of assessing the long-term value of a purchase to a company or individual.Corporations use total cost of ownership as a means of analyzing business deals, while individuals look at TCO as a way of assessing potential purchases.


   How Total Cost of Ownership Works  

Total cost of ownership is considered by companies and individuals when they are looking to buy assets and make investments in capital projects. For a business, the cost of purchase and the costs of operations and maintenance are often itemized separately on financial statements. The former is booked as a capital expenditure, while the latter is part of operating expenditures. A comprehensive analysis of the cost of ownership is a common practice for businesses.



Companies use total cost of ownership over the long term as a framework for analyzing business deals. Looking at total cost of ownership is a way of taking a more holistic approach that assesses the purchase from a broad perspective. This analysis includes the initial purchase price as well as all direct and indirect expenses.



While direct expenses can be easily reported, companies most often seek to analyze all potential indirect expenses that can be of significant influence in deciding whether to complete a purchase.






Total cost of ownership looks at the cost of owning an asset over the long term, by assessing both its purchase price and the costs of operation.


   Example of Total Cost of Ownership  

An example of a business investment that requires a thorough analysis of total cost of ownership is an investment in a new computer system. The computer system has an initial purchase price.



Additional costs often include new software, installation, transition costs, employee training, security costs, disaster recovery planning, ongoing support, and future upgrades. Using these costs as a guide, the company compares the advantages and disadvantages of purchasing the computer system as well as its overall benefit to the company for the long term.



On a smaller scale, individuals also use total cost of ownership when making purchasing decisions. While total cost of ownership can be overlooked, its analysis is essential in preventing unnecessary future losses that can arise from focusing only on the immediate direct costs of a purchase.


   How to Use Total Cost of Ownership  

The purchase of a car is one example where cost comparison matters. Total cost of ownership of a car is not just the purchase price but also the expenses incurred through its use, such as repairs, insurance, and fuel.



The total cost of ownership analysis can be especially important when comparing a used car to a new car. A used car that appears to be a great bargain actually might have a total cost of ownership that is higher than that of a new car if the used car requires numerous repairs, while the new car has a three-year warranty that could cover repair charges.



In the automotive industry, leading consumer resource Kelley Blue Book provides buyers with details on total cost of ownership. This industry analysis is provided for various vehicles and includes a variety of expenses, such as fuel, insurance, repairs, and depreciation.




What Types of Costs Should Be Considered in Total Cost of Ownership (TCO)?
The components of TCO depend on the item but should always include the initial purchase price, costs associated with operating the item, ongoing maintenance, training needed, and how long the item is expected to last before replacement is needed.




What Kinds of Purchases Benefit From a TCO Analysis?
Considering TCO is important before purchasing any item, but especially larger purchases. Cars, homes, and other major purchases should have a TCO analysis. For businesses, a TCO analysis could apply to new technology or equipment needed for the job.




What Resources Are Available to Help Determine TCO?
Any information source about the operating costs of an item will be helpful. Consumer Reports is a good source for many items, including technology and automobiles. Resources like Kelley Blue Book and Edmunds are good sources for information about auto purchases.


   The Bottom Line  

The total cost of ownership can be a useful statistic in a number of situations, from business operations to personal purchases. If you're making a major purchase, remember to look beyond the purchase price to the total costs involved with the product, such as maintenance or repairs.
What Is the Total Debt Service (TDS) Ratio?  

The total debt service (TDS) ratio—total debt obligation divided by gross income—is a financial metric that lenders use to determine whether or not to extend credit, primarily in the mortgage industry. To calculate the percentage of a prospective borrower's gross income already committed to debt obligations, lenders consider all required payments for both housing and non-housing bills.



The housing factor in the TDS calculation includes everything paid for the home, from mortgage payment, real estate taxes, and homeowners insurance to association dues and utilities. The non-housing factor includes everything else, from auto loans, student loans, and credit card payments to child support and alimony.





Key Takeaways

The total debt service (TDS) ratio is a lending metric used by mortgage lenders to assess a borrower's capacity to take on a loan.The total debt service (TDS) ratio, unlike the gross debt service (GDS) ratio, includes both housing and non-housing debts and obligations.A TDS ratio below 43% is typically necessary to obtain a mortgage; many lenders are stricter—with benchmark TDS ratios closer to 36%.


   How Total Debt Service (TDS) Ratio Works  

When applying for a mortgage or any other type of loan, all borrowers should be aware that the total debt service (TDS) ratio is a key factor driving approval or rejection—and it is just as important as a stable income, timely bill payment, and a strong credit score.



Remember, the lower your TDS ratio, the better your chances of approval. Borrowers with higher TDS ratios are more likely to struggle to meet their debt obligations than borrowers with lower ratios.



All lenders will compare your TDS to their benchmark TDS range—usually from 36% to no more than 43%—before they decide whether you can manage an additional monthly payment on top of all other bills. Many lenders prefer a ratio of 36% or less for loan approval; most do not give mortgages to borrowers with TDS ratios that exceed 43%.






Lenders prefer borrowers with total debt service (TDS) ratios of 36% or less; borrowers with TDS ratios that exceed 43% are rarely approved for mortgages.


   Example of the Total Debt Service (TDS) Ratio  

To see how your TDS ratio will be determined, just add up monthly debt obligations and divide them by gross monthly income. Here's a hypothetical example: an individual with a gross monthly income of $11,000 and monthly debt obligations of $4,225 ($2,225 for a mortgage; $1,000 for a student loan; $350 for a motorcycle loan; $650 for a credit card balance).



Divide the total debt obligation of $4,225 by income of $11,000 (in the percentage formula below) to get a TDS ratio of 38.4%, which is not much higher than the low benchmark (36%) and well below the max (43%). This individual would most likely get a mortgage.


   How to Calculate Total Debt Service (TDS) Ratio in Excel  

The total debt service (TDS) ratio can also be calculated in Excel:



Excel formula to calculate TDS ratio: =SUM(debt/income)*100In the example above (gross income of $11,000 and debt obligations of $4,225), the Excel formula would be: =SUM(4225/11000)*100 (which equals 38.4%).


   Total Debt Service (TDS) Ratio vs. Gross Debt Service (GDS) Ratio  

The total debt service (TDS) ratio is very similar to another debt-to-income ratio used by lenders—the gross debt service (GDS) ratio. The difference between TDS and GDS is that GDS does not factor any non-housing payments—such as credit card debts or car loans—into the equation.



Because it reflects housing expenses only, the GDS ratio is also referred to as the housing expense ratio. GDS may be used in other personal loan calculations, but it is most commonly used in the mortgage lending process. (You may also hear GDS referred to as Housing 1 ratio and TDS as Housing 2 ratio.)



In practice, the TDS ratio, the GDS ratio, and a borrower’s credit score are the key components analyzed in the underwriting process for a mortgage loan. (Borrowers should generally strive for a GDS ratio of 28% or less.)


   Special Considerations  

Remember, there are several other factors in addition to the total debt service (TDS) and gross debt service (TDS) ratios that lenders take into consideration when determining whether to advance credit to certain borrowers.



For instance, a small lender—one with less than $2 billion in assets and 500 or fewer mortgages in the past 12 months—may offer a qualified mortgage to a borrower with a TDS ratio exceeding 43%.



Of course, all lenders consider credit histories and credit scores. People with high credit scores tend to manage their debts more responsibly; they hold a reasonable amount of debt, make payments on time, and keep account balances low.



Larger lenders may also be more likely to approve mortgages for borrowers with large savings accounts, especially if they can make larger down payments. Lenders may also consider granting additional credit to borrowers with whom they have long-standing relationships.




How Do You Calculate Total Debt Service (TDS) Ratio?
To calculate TDS: first, add up all monthly debt obligations; then, divide that total by gross monthly income in this percentage formula: (DEBT divided by INCOME) multiplied by 100. If you prefer to calculate in Excel, the formula looks like this: =SUM(debt/income)*100.




How Low Should My TDS Be for a Mortgage?
To be approved for a mortgage, you should have a TDS ratio of no more than 43% (the maximum most lenders allow)—but ideally, your TDS should be as close as possible to 36% (the low end of the benchmark range that lenders prefer).




What Is the Difference Between TDS (Total Debt Service) and GDS (Gross Debt Service)?
TDS and GDS are similar ratios, but the difference is that GDS does not factor any non-housing payments—such as credit card debts or car loans—into the equation.
What Is the Total Debt-to-Capitalization Ratio?  

The total debt-to-capitalization ratio is a tool that measures the total amount of outstanding company debt as a percentage of the firm’s total capitalization. The ratio is an indicator of the company's leverage, which is debt used to purchase assets.



Companies with higher debt must manage it carefully, ensuring enough cash flow is on hand to manage principal and interest payments on debt. Higher debt as a percentage of total capital means a company has a higher risk of insolvency.

   What Does the Total Debt-to-Capitalization Ratio Tell You?  

Every business uses assets to generate sales and profits, and capitalization refers to the amount of money raised to purchase assets. A business can raise money by issuing debt to creditors or by selling stock to shareholders. You can see the amount of capital raised as reported in the long-term debt and stockholders' equity accounts on a company's balance sheet.





Key Takeaways

The total debt to capitalization ratio is a solvency measure that shows the proportion of debt a company uses to finance its assets, relative to the amount of equity used for the same purpose.A higher ratio result means that a company is more highly leveraged, which carries a higher risk of insolvency.


   Examples of the Total Debt-to-Capitalization Ratio in Use  

Assume, for example, that company ABC has short-term debt of $10 million, long-term debt of $30 million and shareholders' equity of $60 million. The company's debt-to-capitalization ratio is calculated as follows:

Although XYZ has a lower dollar amount of total debt compared to ABC, $25 million versus $40 million, debt comprises a significantly larger part of its capital structure. In the event of an economic downturn, XYZ may have a difficult time making the interest payments on its debt, compared to firm ABC.



The acceptable level of total debt for a company depends on the industry in which it operates. While companies in capital-intensive sectors such as utilities, pipelines, and telecommunications are typically highly leveraged, their cash flows have a greater degree of predictability than companies in other sectors that generate less consistent earnings.
What Is the Total-Debt-to-Total-Assets Ratio?  

Total-debt-to-total-assets is a leverage ratio that defines how much debt a company owns compared to its assets. Using this metric, analysts can compare one company's leverage with that of other companies in the same industry. This information can reflect how financially stable a company is. The higher the ratio, the higher the degree of leverage (DoL) and, consequently, the higher the risk of investing in that company.





Key Takeaways

The total-debt-to-total-assets ratio shows the degree to which a company has used debt to finance its assets.The calculation considers all of the company's debt, not just loans and bonds payable, and considers all assets, including intangibles.The total-debt-to-total-assets ratio is calculated by dividing a company's total amount of debt by the company's total amount of assets. If a company has a total-debt-to-total-assets ratio of 0.4, 40% of its assets are financed by creditors, and 60% are financed by owners' (shareholders') equity.The ratio does not inform users of the composition of assets nor how a single company's ratio may compare to others in the same industry.

   Understanding the Total-Debt-to-Total-Assets Ratio  

The total-debt-to-total-assets ratio analyzes a company's balance sheet. The calculation includes long-term and short-term debt (borrowings maturing within one year) of the company. It also encompasses all assets—both tangible and intangible. It indicates how much debt is used to carry a firm's assets, and how those assets might be used to service debt. It, therefore, measures a firm's degree of leverage.



Debt servicing payments must be made under all circumstances, otherwise, the company would breach its debt covenants and run the risk of being forced into bankruptcy by creditors. While other liabilities such as accounts payable and long-term leases can be negotiated to some extent, there is very little “wiggle room” with debt covenants.



A company with a high degree of leverage may thus find it more difficult to stay afloat during a recession than one with low leverage. It should be noted that the total debt measure does not include short-term liabilities such as accounts payable and long-term liabilities such as capital leases and pension plan obligations.


  Total-Debt-to-Total-Assets Formula  

The total-debt-to-total-assets formula is the quotient of total debt divided by total assets. As shown below, total debt includes both short-term and long-term liabilities. All company assets, including short-term, long-term, capital, tangible, or other.

If the calculation yields a result greater than 1, this means the company is technically insolvent as it has more liabilities than all of its assets combined. More often, the total-debt-to-total assets ratio will be less than one. A calculation of 0.5 (or 50%) means that 50% of the company's assets are financed using debt (with the other half being financed through equity).


   What Does the Total-Debt-to-Total-Assets Ratio Tell You?  

Total-debt-to-total-assets is a measure of the company's assets that are financed by debt rather than equity. When calculated over a number of years, this leverage ratio shows how a company has grown and acquired its assets as a function of time.



Investors use the ratio to evaluate whether the company has enough funds to meet its current debt obligations and to assess whether the company can pay a return on its investment. Creditors use the ratio to see how much debt the company already has and whether the company can repay its existing debt. This will determine whether additional loans will be extended to the firm.



A ratio greater than 1 shows that a considerable portion of the assets is funded by debt. In other words, the company has more liabilities than assets. A high ratio also indicates that a company may be putting itself at risk of defaulting on its loans if interest rates were to rise suddenly.



A ratio below 0.5, meanwhile, indicates that a greater portion of a company's assets is funded by equity. This often gives a company more flexibility, as companies can increase, decrease, pause, or cancel future dividend plans to shareholders. Alternatively, once locked into debt obligations, a company is often legally bound to that agreement.






A total-debt-to-total-asset ratio greater than one means that if the company were to cease operating, not all debtors would receive payment on their holdings.


   Real-World Example of the Total-Debt-to-Total-Assets Ratio  

Let's examine the total-debt-to-total-assets ratio for three companies:



Alphabet, Inc. (Google), as of its fiscal quarter ending March 31, 2022.Costco Wholesale, as of its fiscal quarter ending May 8, 2022.Hertz Global Holdings, as of its fiscal quarter ending March 31, 2022.

Debt to Assets Comparison



From the example above, the companies are ordered from highest degree of flexibility to lowest degree of flexibility.



Google is not weighed down by debt obligations and will likely be able to secure additional capital at potentially lower rates compared to the other two companies. Although its debt balance is more than three times higher than Costco, it carries proportionally less debt compared to total assets compared to the other two companies.
Costco has been financed nearly evenly split between debt and equity. This means the company carries roughly the same amount of debt as it does in retained earnings, common stock, and net income.
Hertz is relatively known for carrying a high degree of debt on its balance sheet. Although its debt balance is smaller than the other two companies, almost 90% of all the assets it owns are financed. Hertz has the lowest degree of flexibility of these three companies as it has legal obligations to fulfill (whereas Google has flexibility regarding dividend distributions to shareholders).



It's also important to understand the size, industry, and goals of each company to interpret their total-debt-to-total-assets. Google is no longer a technology start-up; it is an established company with proven revenue models that is easier to attract investors. Meanwhile, Hertz is a much smaller company that may not be as enticing to shareholders. Hertz may find the demands of investors are too great to secure financing, turning to financial institutions for its capital instead.






Total-debt-to-total-assets may be reported as a decimal or a percentage. For example, Google's .30 total-debt-to-total-assets may also be communicated as 30%. This means 30% of Google's assets are financed through debt.


   Limitations of the Total-Debt-to-Total-Assets Ratio  

One shortcoming of the total-debt-to-total-assets ratio is that it does not provide any indication of asset quality since it lumps all tangible and intangible assets together.



For example, in the example above, Hertz is reporting $2.9 billion of intangible assets, $611 million of PPE, and $1.04 billion of goodwill as part of its total $20.9 billion of assets. Therefore, the company has more debt on its books than all of its current assets. Should all of its debts be called immediately by lenders, the company would be unable to pay all its debt, even if the total-debt-to-total-assets ratio indicates it might be able to.



As with all other ratios, the trend of the total-debt-to-total-assets ratio should be evaluated over time. This will help assess whether the company’s financial risk profile is improving or deteriorating. For example, an increasing trend indicates that a business is unwilling or unable to pay down its debt, which could indicate a default in the future.




What Is a Good Total-Debt-to-Total-Assets Ratio?
A company's total-debt-to-total-assets ratio is specific to that company's size, industry, sector, and capitalization strategy. For example, start-up tech companies are often more reliant on private investors and will have lower total-debt-to-total-asset calculations. However, more secure, stable companies may find it easier to secure loans from banks and have higher ratios. In general, a ratio around 0.3 to 0.6 is where many investors will feel comfortable, though a company's specific situation may yield different results.




Is a Low Total-Debt-to-Total-Asset Ratio Good?
A low total-debt-to-total-asset ratio isn't necessarily good or bad. It simply means that the company has decided to prioritize raising money by issuing stock to investors instead of taking out loans at a bank. While a lower calculation means a company avoids paying as much interest, it also means owners retain less residual profits because shareholders may be entitled to a portion of the company's earnings.




How Do I Calculate Total-Debt-to-Total-Assets?
The total-debt-to-total-asset ratio is calculated by dividing a company's total debts by its total assets. All debts are considered, and all assets are considered.




Can A Company's Total-Debt-to-Total-Asset Ratio Be Too High?
No, a company's total-debt-to-total-asset ratio can't be too high. Even if a company has a ratio close to 100%, this simply means the company has decided to not to issue much (if any) stock. It is simply an indication of the strategy management has incurred to raise money.The downside to having a high total-debt-to-total-asset ratio is it may become too expensive to incur additional debt. The company will likely already be paying principal and interest payments, eating into the company's profits instead of being re-invested into the company.


   The Bottom Line  

The total-debt-to-total-assets ratio compares the total amount of liabilities of a company to all of its assets. The ratio is used to measure how leveraged the company is, as higher ratios indicate more debt is used as opposed to equity capital. To gain the best insight into the total-debt-to-total-assets ratio, it's often best to compare the findings of a single company over time or compare the ratios of different companies.
What Is Total Enterprise Value (TEV)?  

Total enterprise value (TEV) is a valuation measurement used to compare companies with varying levels of debt. It includes not only a company's equity value but also the market value of its debt while subtracting out cash and cash equivalents.



TEV is considered a more comprehensive alternative to market capitalization and is commonly used to calculate the cost of a target company in a takeover.





Key Takeaways

   Understanding Total Enterprise Value (TEV)  

Some financial analysts use market capitalization analysis to derive the value of a company. Market capitalization is the value of a company by multiplying the current stock price by the total number of outstanding shares. However, since companies often have different financial and capital structures, TEV is generally considered to be a better value measure when comparing companies.



TEV is used to derive the overall economic value of a company and is often seen as a more comprehensive metric since it factors in a company's debt and cash, which can have a significant impact on a company's financial health and value.



TEV is particularly helpful when companies engage in mergers and acquisitions (M&A). If an acquiring firm is interested in a company, it would need to know how much debt the target company has on its balance sheet.



The acquiring firm might need to pay off the debt as part of the takeover. Also, if the acquiring firm had debt on its balance sheet, it would be critical to know the amount of outstanding debt for the target company since it could impact whether or not the deal gets done. 






TEV is often seen as a more comprehensive way to value a company since it factors in debt and cash, which have a significant impact on a company's financial health and value.

TEV = market capitalization + market value of debt + preferred stock - cash and cash equivalents


TEV=marketcapitalization+marketvalueofdebt+preferredstock−cashandcashequivalents



Market capitalization is added to the company's total amount of debt. Preferred stock is also added because it is a hybrid security, which has features of equity and debt. Preferred shares are treated as debt because they pay dividends and have a higher priority when it comes to claiming earnings versus common stock. Also, preferred shares are repaid similar to debt in the event of an acquisition.



Cash and cash equivalents, meanwhile, are subtracted from the formula because they reduce the cost of acquiring the company. Cash equivalents may consist of short-term investments, commercial paper, money market funds, and marketable securities with a maturity date of 90 days or less.


   Total Enterprise Value (TEV) vs. Market Capitalization  

Often, two companies that seem to have similar market capitalizations have very different TEVs.



For example, if a company was trying to compare its value to the value of a competitor, it would have to look beyond market capitalizations. Let's say that the competitor has a market capitalization of $100 million but has $50 million in debt. The company conducting the comparison might also have a market cap of $100 million but might instead have no debt and $10 million cash on hand. Based on TEV, the cost to purchase the competitor would be $150 million, whereas the company conducting the comparison would cost $90 million.



Now let's say that instead of a comparison to a competitor, the company was looking to acquire the competitor. Using the market capitalization value, we would say that the takeover price for acquiring the company is worth $100 million.



However, TEV shows that the cost of acquisition is really $150 million, due to the debt of $50 million in addition to the $100 million market cap. It's important to remember that the acquiring company would be buying the target company's debt as well as its assets.






TEV is a more accurate measure for valuing the price of a company during a merger or acquisition as it represents the cost to purchase the company. 


   Using Total Enterprise Value (TEV) to Normalize Values  

The TEV, in addition to being a metric for comparing potential takeover candidates, also allows a company or financial analyst to normalize the valuation of a company.



Many financial analysts use the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, which measures a company’s share price relative to its earnings per share (EPS), to derive a company's value, above and beyond its market capitalization. However, a company's P/E ratio does not always provide a complete picture since it only includes the market capitalization and profits (or earnings) of the company. P/E ratios can make a company appear expensive compared to another company when, in reality, that might not be the case should one have a lot of debt on its balance sheet while the other is flush with cash.



Financial analysts can normalize a company's valuation by taking the EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization)-to-enterprise value. The EBITDA-to-enterprise value metric, also known as EV/EBITDA, allows the stock price of public companies to be better evaluated for investment purposes. The reason for this is that the calculation includes the components of the P/E ratio, such as profits and market capitalization, as well as all of the components in the TEV calculation such as total debt.




What Does Total Enterprise Value (TEV) Tell You?
TEV breaks down the value of a company. It goes further than market capitalization by also factoring in a company’s debts as well as its cash reserves. TEV can be thought of as the theoretical total price an acquirer pays to purchase a company and settle all claims against it.




How Do You Calculate Total Enterprise Value (TEV)?
TEV is calculated as market capitalization + total debt + preferred stock – cash and cash equivalents.




Why Is Cash Subtracted from Total Enterprise Value (TEV)?
Because it reduces the cost of acquiring the company. Let’s say a company wants to acquire another one that’s valued at $100 million. If the target company were to have $20 million in cash on its books, its real purchase cost would be reduced to $80 million as acquiring it would give access to its $20 million in cash. All else being equal, a higher cash balance leads to a lower TEV, and vice-versa.




Why Is Debt Added to Total Enterprise Value (TEV)?
Higher debt triggers a higher TEV because it represents an added cost that must be paid by any would-be acquirer. 




Can a Company Have a Negative Total Enterprise Value (TEV)?
Yes. It is possible for a company to have more cash than its market value and debt. In theory, that would make it an attractive investment.


   The Bottom Line  

Total enterprise value (TEV) is one of many useful tools to value companies and not just for M&A purposes, either. This metric better enables investors to compare companies with different capital structures and get a greater sense of which one is potentially undervalued by the market.
What Is the Total Expense Ratio (TER)?  

The total expense ratio (TER) is a measure of the total costs associated with managing and operating an investment fund, such as a mutual fund. These costs consist primarily of management fees and additional expenses, such as trading fees, legal fees, auditor fees, and other operational expenses.



The total cost of the fund is divided by the fund’s total assets to arrive at a percentage amount, which represents the TER. The TER is also known as the net expense ratio or after reimbursement expense ratio.





Key Takeaways


The total expense ratio (TER) describes a mutual fund’s operating costs relative to its assets.
It is a measure of a fund’s operational efficiency.
Investors pay attention to the expense ratio to determine if a fund is an appropriate investment for them after fees are considered.
TER is also known as the net expense ratio or after reimbursement expense ratio.



   How the Total Expense Ratio (TER) Works  

The size of the TER is important to investors as the costs are withdrawn from the fund, affecting investors’ returns. For example, if a fund generates a return of 7% for the year but has a TER of 4%, then the 7% gain is greatly diminished to roughly 3%.



The TER provides a way for the annual costs of running a particular fund to be covered. It takes all of the known costs associated with the fund’s operation and expresses them as a single number, generally as a percentage, drawing its basis from the assets associated with the fund. This means that the amount provided as the TER is dependent on the success of the particular fund.



The funds supplied through the TER are used to support the management, trading, and legal fees associated with the fund, as well as any audit costs or general operating expenses. Anytime a fund incurs higher or lower operating expenses, those changes are likely passed along within the TER.



The more actively managed the fund, the higher the associated TER. This is due to increased personnel costs, as well as increased transaction-based fees—the fund manager pays a brokerage fee each time a buy and sell trade is executed. By comparison, an automated or passive fund has significantly lower costs of operation, resulting in a lower TER.


   Total Expense Ratio (TER) Formula and Calculation  

Below is the formula and the steps to calculate the TER:















TER formula.
Investopedia 



To calculate the TER:



Obtain the total assets of the fund, which can be derived from financial disclosures that mutual funds report to regulators or are disseminated to analysts and investors via a prospectus.
Obtain the total costs from the prospectus, which can be more challenging since the TER accounts for all costs associated with operating the investment fund, including trading costs, management costs, and overhead and administration costs (such as 12b-1 fees, which are the costs of marketing the fund).


   Understanding Operating Expenses  

Operating expenses, or operating costs, cover any outgoing financial obligations associated with the management of the fund and the corresponding transactions. This can include employee compensation and brokerage fees, in addition to any accountant fees.



Other common expenses include shareholder communications and financial statements, record-keeping mechanisms, and custodial services from the overseeing organization or asset manager.



A small percentage of the TER may be directed to other business operation costs. This can include expenses as simple as space rental and utilities for the business. Often, these expenses are referred to as overhead and include any financial obligation that is not necessarily directed to the actual production of a good or service.


   How Does the Total Expense Ratio (TER) Differ From the Gross Expense Ratio (GER)?  

The gross expense ratio (GER) is the total percentage of a mutual fund’s assets that are devoted to running the fund. In some cases, a fund may have agreements in place for waiving, reimbursing, or recouping some of the fund’s fees. This is often the case for new funds. An investment company and its fund managers may agree to waive certain fees following the launch of a new fund to keep the expense ratio lower for investors.



The TER represents the fees charged to the fund after any waivers, reimbursements, and recoupments have been made. These fee reductions are typically for a specified time frame, after which the fund may incur all full costs.


   What Are the Limitations of the Total Expense Ratio (TER)?  

The TER is meant to capture the entire cost that an investor can expect from owning an investment fund. However, some charges, especially those that are either made only once or made from the investment capital, may not be included in the TER. These include commission, stockbroker fees, securities transfer tax, and annual advisor fees.


   The Bottom Line  

The total expense ratio (TER) can help an investor measure the costs associated with managing and operating an investment fund. This can be a measure of the fund's efficiency and help to see if it's an appropriate investment.
What are Total Liabilities?  

Total liabilities are the combined debts and obligations that an individual or company owes to outside parties. Everything the company owns is classified as an asset and all amounts the company owes for future obligations are recorded as liabilities. On the balance sheet, total assets minus total liabilities equals equity.





Key Takeaways

Total liabilities are the combined debts that an individual or company owes. They are generally broken down into three categories: short-term, long-term, and other liabilities.On the balance sheet, total liabilities plus equity must equal total assets.

   Understanding Total Liabilities  

Liabilities can be described as an obligation between one party and another that has not yet been completed or paid for. They are settled over time through the transfer of economic benefits, including money, goods, or services.



Liabilities consist of many items ranging from monthly lease payments, to utility bills, bonds issued to investors and corporate credit card debt. Money received by an individual or company for a service or product that has yet to be provided or delivered, otherwise known as unearned revenue, is also recorded as a liability because the revenue has still not been earned and represents products or services owed to a customer. 



Future pay-outs on things such as pending lawsuits and product warranties must be listed as liabilities, too, if the contingency is likely and the amount can be reasonably estimated. These are referred to as contingent liabilities. 


   Types of Liabilities  

On the balance sheet, a company's total liabilities are generally split up into three categories: short-term, long-term, and other liabilities. Total liabilities are calculated by summing all short-term and long-term liabilities, along with any off-balance sheet liabilities that corporations may incur.


  Short-term liabilities  

Short-term, or current liabilities, are liabilities that are due within one year or less. They can include payroll expenses, rent, and accounts payable (AP), money owed by a company to its customers.



Because payment is due within a year, investors and analysts are keen to ascertain that a company has enough cash on its books to cover its short-term liabilities.


  Long-term liabilities   

Long-term liabilities, or noncurrent liabilities, are debts and other non-debt financial obligations with a maturity beyond one year. They can include debentures, loans, deferred tax liabilities, and pension obligations.



Less liquidity is required to pay for long-term liabilities as these obligations are due over a longer timeframe. Investors and analysts generally expect them to be settled with assets derived from future earnings or financing transactions. One year is generally enough time to turn inventory into cash.


  Other liabilities  

When something in financial statements is referred to as “other” it typically means that it is unusual, does not fit into major categories and is considered to be relatively minor. In the case of liabilities, the “other” tag can refer to things like intercompany borrowings and sales taxes.



Investors can discover what a company’s other liabilities are by checking out the footnotes in its financial statements.


   Advantages of Total Liabilities  

In isolation, total liabilities serve little purpose, other than to potentially compare how a company’s obligations stack up against a competitor operating in the same sector.



However, when used with other figures, total liabilities can be a useful metric for analyzing a company's operations. One example is in an entity's debt-to-equity ratio. Used to evaluate a company's financial leverage, this ratio reflects the ability of shareholder equity to cover all outstanding debts in the event of a business downturn. A similar ratio called debt-to-assets compares total liabilities to total assets to show how assets are financed.


   Special Considerations  

A larger amount of total liabilities is not in-and-of-itself a financial indicator of poor economic quality of an entity. Based on prevailing interest rates available to the company, it may be most favorable for the business to acquire debt assets by incurring liabilities. 



However, the total liabilities of a business have a direct relationship with the creditworthiness of an entity. In general, if a company has relatively low total liabilities, it may gain favorable interest rates on any new debt it undertakes from lenders, as lower total liabilities lessen the chance of default risk.
What Is Total Quality Management (TQM)?  

Total quality management (TQM) is the continual process of detecting and reducing or eliminating errors in manufacturing. It streamlines supply chain management, improves the customer experience, and ensures that employees are up to speed with training. Total quality management aims to hold all parties involved in the production process accountable for the overall quality of the final product or service.





Key Takeaways

Total quality management (TQM) is an ongoing process of detecting and reducing or eliminating errors.Total quality management is used to streamline supply chain management, improve customer service, and ensure that employees are properly trained.The focus is to improve the quality of an organization's outputs, including goods and services, through the continual improvement of internal practices. Total quality management aims to hold all parties involved in the production process accountable for the overall quality of the final product or service.There are often eight guiding principles to TQM that range from focusing on customers, continually improving, and adhering to processes.

   Understanding Total Quality Management (TQM)  

Total quality management is a structured approach to overall organizational management. The focus of the process is to improve the quality of an organization's outputs, including goods and services, through the continual improvement of internal practices. The standards set as part of the TQM approach can reflect both internal priorities and any industry standards currently in place.



Industry standards can be defined at multiple levels and may include adherence to various laws and regulations governing the operation of a particular business. Industry standards can also include the production of items to an understood norm, even if the norm is not backed by official regulations. Acceptance sampling might be used to check the progress toward the TQM goal.


   Example of Total Quality Management  

Perhaps the most famous example of TQM is Toyota's implementation of the kanban system. A kanban is a physical signal that creates a chain reaction, resulting in a specific action. Toyota used this idea to implement its just-in-time (JIT) inventory process.



The company decided to keep just enough inventory on hand to fill customer orders as they were generated to make its assembly line more efficient. All parts of Toyota's assembly line are therefore assigned a physical card that has an associated inventory number.



The card is removed and moved up the supply chain right before a part is installed in a car, effectively requesting another of the same part. This allows the company to keep its inventory lean and not overstock unnecessary assets. Effective quality management resulted in better automobiles that could be produced at an affordable price.


   History of Total Quality Management  

TQM's history often dates back to the early 1900s when Walter A. Shewhart introduced modern quality control. Shewhart produced a landmark piece of industrial work entitled Economic Control of Quality of Manufactured Product in 1931. This exposition is considered one of the founding and basic principles of manufacturing quality control.



Further developments in Shewhart's work introduced new standards in quality management decades later. Joseph M. Juran published a book called What Is Total Quality Control? The Japanese Way. in 1954. The work was based on Juran's experience of being invited to Japan by Japanese scientists and engineers. Juran later co-authored Quality Planning and Analysis, another bestseller in TQM.



Another prominent figure in TQM history is W. Edwards Deming. Also posted in Japan after the Second World War, Deming became involved with the Union of Japanese Scientists and Engineers (JUSE). His career work included several TQM frameworks (Deming's 14 Points, Deming's Seven Deadly Diseases of Management, and The Deming Wheel).






The exact origin of the phrase total quality management is not known, but several parties mentioned above are credited for helping develop the general concept.


   Primary Principles of Total Quality Management  

TQM is considered a customer-focused process that focuses on consistently improving business operations management. It strives to ensure that all associated employees work toward the common goals of improving product or service quality, as well as improving the procedures that are in place for production. There are several guiding principles that define TQM.


  Focus on Customers  

Under TQM, your customers define whether your products are high quality. Customer input is highly valued because it allows a company to better understand the needs and requirements in the manufacturing process. Customer surveys may reveal insufficient durability of goods. This input is then fed back into TQM systems to implement better raw material sourcing, manufacturing processes, and quality control procedures.


  Commitment by Employees  

Employees must buy into the processes and system if TQM is going to be successful. This includes clearly communicating across departments and leaders what goals, expectations, needs, and constraints are in place. A company adopting TQM principles must be willing to train employees and give them sufficient resources to complete tasks successfully and on time. TQM also strives to reduce attrition and maintain knowledgeable workers.


  Improve Continuously  

A company should gradually evolve and strive for incremental, small improvements as it learns more about its customers, processes, and competition. This concept of continuous improvement helps a company adapt to changing market expectations. It allows for greater adaptability to different products, markets, customers, or regions. Continuous improvement also drives and widens the competitive advantage that a company has built over related companies.


  Adherence to Processes  

TQM's systematic approach relies heavily on process flowcharts, TQM diagrams, visual action plans, and documented workflows. Every member engaged in the process must be aware and educated on their part of the process to ensure proper steps are taken at the right time of production. These processes are then continually analyzed to better understand deficiencies in the process.


  Strategic and Systematic Approach  

A company's processes and procedures should be a direct reflection of the organization's vision, mission, and long-term plan. TQM calls for a system approach to decision making that requires that a company dedicate itself to integrating quality as its core component and making the appropriate financial investments to make that happen.


  Data Utilization  

The systematic approach of TQM only works if feedback and input is given to evaluate how the process flow is moving. Management must continually rely on production, turnover, efficiency, and employee metrics to correlate the anticipated outcomes with the actual results. TQM relies heavily on documentation and planning, and only by utilizing and analyzing data can management understand if those plans are being met.


  Integrate Systems  

One way to utilize data is to integrate systems. TQM strategies believe systems should talk to each other, conveying useful information across departments and making smart decisions. When goods or inventory are used in one area, another department should have immediate access to that ERP information. TQM strives to allow everyone to be on the same page at the same time by linking data sources and sharing information across systems.


  Communication  

Data may transfer between departments freely, but there is a human element to coordinating processes and making sure an entire production line is operating efficiently. Effective communication plays a large part in TQM to motivate employees, educate members along a process, and avoid process errors whether it is normal day-to-day operations or large organizational changes.






Successful TQM requires a company-wide buy-in of every principle. The benefits of TQM quickly diminish if a company does not receive complete buy-in.


   How to Implement Total Quality Management  

TQM is a unique process. There is not a specific formula for implementing a system that suits every business and each type of industry. But you can create a checklist of issues that might suit your enterprise and proceed with them in chronological order. Some may suit your business while others will not. Select those that you think will provide an advantage.



Identify your company’s existing culture, its core values, and its systems.Use this information to create a system that will serve as your master plan.Establish what your customers and clients want and what they expect from your business. Determine how to best meet these expectations and needs.Create a team of management and employees to guide and implement your goals andinclude these efforts in your daily business management process.Consistently gather feedback from both employees and customers to gauge your progress.






TQM is not a speedy process. Expect to dedicate an extended period of time to your efforts.


   Advantages and Disadvantages of TQM  

TQM results in a company making a product for less when it's implemented correctly. Companies that engage in TQM provide more consistent products that yield stronger customer loyalty when they emphasize quality and minimize waste.



As TQM touches every department across an organization, a company may reap substantial savings from materials sourcing, production, distribution, or back-office functions. Companies that successfully implement TQM can usually react more quickly to change and proactively plan ahead to avoid obsolescence.



A company must fully engage TQM principles to fully reap the benefits of TQM. This requires substantial buy-in from every department across an organization. This level of commitment is very difficult to achieve, requires substantial financial investment, and necessitates all levels of management to engage in TQM.



The conversion to TQM may be lengthy, and workers may feel resistant to change. A company may be required to replace processes, employees, equipment, or materials in favor of an untested, partially developed TQM plan. More skilled workers may decide to leave the company if they feel TQM processes don't appropriately utilize their skill sets.

May be met with resistance to change
Requires company-wide buy-in to be successful





   Industries Using Total Quality Management  

TQM originated in the manufacturing sector, but its principles can be applied to a variety of industries. It provides a cohesive vision for systemic change with a focus on long-term change rather than short-term goals. TQM is used in many industries with this in mind, including but not limited to manufacturing, banking and finance, and medicine.



These techniques can be applied to all departments within an individual organization. This helps ensure that all employees are working toward the goals set forth for the company and improving function in each area. Involved departments can include administration, marketing, production, and employee training.




What Does Total Quality Management Do?
TQM oversees all activities and tasks that are necessary to maintain a desired level of excellence within a business and its operations. This includes the determination of a quality policy, creating and implementing quality planning and assurance, and quality control and quality improvement measures.




What Are the Principles of TQM?
Various iterations of TQM have been developed, each with its own set of principles. Certain core elements persist nonetheless. These include good leadership, emphasis on quality, customer priority, error correction and improvement as an ongoing process, and job training.




What Is a TQM Diagram?
A TQM diagram is a visual depiction of the business and process layout. The diagram usually shows different processes or steps, allowing management to see a process, analyze weaknesses or risks in the flow, and strategically adjust how things are done.


   The Bottom Line  

Total quality management is the strategic framework that encourages everyone in an organization to focus on quality improvement. The theory holds that customer satisfaction will increase by being operationally excellent. Many principles drive TQM, but the overall purpose is to eliminate errors, streamline processes, and maximize efficiency.
What Is Total Return?  

Total return, when measuring performance, is the actual rate of return of an investment or a pool of investments over a given evaluation period. Total return includes interest, capital gains, dividends, and distributions realized over a period. Total return accounts for two categories of return: income including interest paid by fixed-income investments, distributions, or dividends and capital appreciation, representing the change in the market price of an asset.





Key Takeaways:

Total return is the actual rate of return of an investment or a pool of investments over a period.Total return includes interest, capital gains, dividends, and realized distributions.Total return is expressed as a percentage of the amount invested.Total return is a strong measure of an investment’s overall performance.


   Understanding Total Return  

Total return is the amount of value an investor earns from a security over a specific period, typically one year when all distributions are reinvested. The total return is expressed as a percentage of the amount invested. For example, a total return of 20% means the security increased by 20% of its original value due to a price increase, distribution of dividends (if a stock), coupons (if a bond), or capital gains (if a fund). It is a strong measure of an investment’s overall performance.


  Significance of Total Return  

Some of the best dividend stocks have low growth potential and produce small capital gains. Basing an investment’s return on capital gains alone does not take into consideration price increases or other methods of growing the stock’s value. For example, an investor buys shares of Company B, and the share price increases 24.5% in one year. The investor gains 24.5% from the price change alone. Since Company B also paid a dividend during the year, adding in the stock’s yield of 4.1% to the price change, the combined return is 28.6%.



Total return determines an investment’s true growth over time. It is important to evaluate the big picture and not just one return metric when determining an increase in value.



Total return is used when analyzing a company’s historical performance. Calculating expected future return puts reasonable expectations on an investor’s investments and helps plan for retirement or other needs.


  Average Annual Total Returns   

When analyzing mutual fund performance, investors should analyze their average annual total returns for different periods. Comparing returns to a benchmark indicates how the fund has performed, relative to an index. When analyzing average annual total returns, it's important to remember:



The numbers almost always reflect the reinvestment of dividends and capital gains distributions.Effects of sales charges may or may not be included. However, this information is disclosed with return numbers.


   Example of Total Return  

An investor buys 100 shares of Stock A at $20 per share for an initial value of $2,000. Stock A pays a 5% dividend the investor reinvests, buying five additional shares. After one year, the share price rises to $22.



To calculate the investment's total return, the investor divides the total investment gains (105 shares x $22 per share = $2,310 current value - $2,000 initial value = $310 total gains) by the initial value of the investment ($2,000) and multiplies by 100 to convert the answer to a percentage ($310 / $2,000 x 100 = 15.5%). The investor's total return is 15.5%.
What Is a Total Return Index?  

A total return index is a type of equity index that tracks both the capital gains as well as any cash distributions, such as dividends or interest, attributed to the components of the index. A look at an index's total return displays a more accurate representation of the index's performance to shareholders.



By assuming dividends are reinvested, it effectively accounts for those stocks in an index that do not issue dividends and instead reinvest their earnings within the underlying company as retained earnings. A total return index can be contrasted with a price return or nominal index.





Key Takeaways

A total return index computes the index value based on capital gains plus cash payments such as dividends and interest.A total return index, in contrast to a price index, better reflects the actual returns that an investor holding the index components would receive.The total return will tend to exceed the nominal return that only accounts for price increases in the assets held.Many popular indices compute total return, such as S&P, which produces the S&P 500 Total Return Index (SPTR). 


   Total Return Indexes Explained  

A total return index may be deemed more accurate than other methods that do not account for the activity associated with dividends or distributions, such as those that focus purely on the annual yield.



For example, an investment may show an annual yield of 4% along with an increase in share price of 6%. While the yield is only a partial reflection of the growth experienced, the total return includes both yields and the increased value of the shares to show a growth of 10%. If the same index experienced a 4% loss instead of a 6% gain in share price, the total return would show as 0%.


   Example: The S&P 500  

The S&P 500 Total Return Index (SPTR) is one example of a total return index. The total return indexes follow a similar pattern in which many mutual funds operate, where all resulting cash payouts are automatically reinvested back into the fund itself. While most total return indexes refer to equity-based indexes, there are total return indexes for bonds that assume that all coupon payments and redemptions are reinvested through buying more bonds in the index.



Other total return indexes include the Dow Jones Industrials Total Return Index (DJITR) and the Russell 2000 Index.


   Differences Between Price Return and Total Return Index Funds  

Total returns stand in contrast to price returns, which do not take into account dividends and cash payouts. Including dividends makes a significant difference in the return of the fund, as demonstrated by two of the most prominent.



For instance, the price return for the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY) since it was introduced in 1993 was 789% as of March 10, 2021. The total return price (dividends reinvested), however, is close to 1,400%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average over the 10 years ended in March 2021 had a price return of 162%, while the total return rose to 228%.


   Understanding Index Funds  

Index funds are a reflection of the index they are based on. For example, an index fund associated with the S&P 500 may have one of each of the securities included in the index, or may include securities that are deemed to be a representative sample of the index’s performance as a whole.



The purpose of an index fund is to mirror the activity, or growth, of the index that functions as its benchmark. In that regard, index funds only require passive management when adjustments need to be made to help the index fund keep pace with its associated index. Due to the lower management requirements, the fees associated with index funds may be lower than those that are more actively managed. Additionally, an index fund may be seen as a lower risk since it provides for an innate level of diversification.
What Is a Total Return Swap?  

A total return swap is a swap agreement in which one party makes payments based on a set rate, either fixed or variable, while the other party makes payments based on the return of an underlying asset, which includes both the income it generates and any capital gains. In total return swaps, the underlying asset, referred to as the reference asset, is usually an equity index, a basket of loans, or bonds. The asset is owned by the party receiving the set rate payment.





Key Takeaways

In a total return swap, one party makes payments according to a set rate, while another party makes payments based on the rate of an underlying or reference asset.Total return swaps permit the party receiving the total return to benefit from the reference asset without owning it.The receiving party also collects any income generated by the asset but, in exchange, must pay a set rate over the life of the swap.The receiver assumes systematic and credit risks, whereas the payer assumes no performance risk but takes on the credit exposure the receiver may be subject to.






   Understanding Total Return Swaps  

A total return swap allows the party receiving the total return to gain exposure and benefit from a reference asset without actually owning it. These swaps are popular with hedge funds because they provide the benefit of a large exposure to an asset with a minimal cash outlay. The two parties involved in a total return swap are known as the total return payer and the total return receiver.



A total return swap is similar to a bullet swap; however, with a bullet swap, payment is postponed until the swap ends or the position closes.


   Requirements for Total Return Swaps  

In a total return swap, the party receiving the total return collects any income generated by the asset and benefits if the price of the asset appreciates over the life of the swap. In exchange, the total return receiver must pay the asset owner the set rate over the life of the swap.



If the asset's price falls over the swap's life, the total return receiver will be required to pay the asset owner the amount by which the asset has fallen. In a total return swap, the receiver assumes systematic, or market, risk and credit risk. Conversely, the payer forfeits the risk associated with the performance of the referenced security but takes on the credit exposure to which the receiver may be subject.


   Total Return Swap Example  

Assume that two parties enter into a one-year total return swap in which one party receives the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) in addition to a fixed margin of 2%. The other party receives the total return of the Standard & Poor's 500 Index (S&P 500) on a principal amount of $1 million.



After one year, if LIBOR is 3.5% and the S&P 500 appreciates by 15%, the first party pays the second party 15% and receives 5.5%. The payment is netted at the end of the swap with the second party receiving a payment of $95,000, or [$1 million x (15% - 5.5%)]. 



Conversely, consider that rather than appreciating, the S&P 500 falls by 15%. The first party would receive 15% in addition to the LIBOR rate plus the fixed margin, and the payment netted to the first party would be $205,000, or [$1 million x (15% + 5.5%)].
What Is Total Shareholder Return (TSR)?  

Total shareholder return (TSR) is a measure of financial performance, indicating the total amount an investor reaps from an investment—specifically, equities or shares of stock. To arrive at its total, usually expressed as a percentage, TSR factors in capital gains and dividends from a stock; it might also include special distributions, stock splits, and warrants. Whichever way it is calculated, TSR means the same thing: the sum total of what a stock has returned to those who invested in it.





Key Takeaways

Total shareholder return (TSR) is a measure of financial performance, indicating the total amount an investor reaps from an investment—specifically, equities or shares of stock.Total shareholder return factors in capital gains and dividends when measuring the total return generated by a stock.The formula for calculating TSR is { (current price - purchase price) + dividends } ÷ purchase price.TSR represents an easily understood figure of the overall financial benefits generated for stockholders.TSR is a good gauge of an investment's long-term value, but it is limited to past performance, requires an investment to generate cash flows, and can be sensitive to stock market volatility.


   Understanding Total Shareholder Return (TSR)  

An investor makes money from stock in two basic ways: capital gains and current income. A capital gain is a change in the market price of the stock from the time it was purchased to the date it was sold (or the current price if it is still owned)—profits, in other words. Current income is the dividends paid out by the company from its earnings while the investor still owns the stock.



When calculating TSR, an investor can only consider the dividends they actually received or were eligible to receive. For example, they may be in possession of the stock on the day the dividend is payable, yet they receive the dividend only if they owned the stock on or before the ex-dividend date. Therefore, an investor needs to know the stock’s ex-dividend date rather than the dividend payment date when calculating TSR.






Dividends, which are per-share distributions of some of a company's earnings to certain classes of its stockholders, can include stock buyback programs, one-time payments, and regular quarterly or semi-annual cash payouts.



TSR is most useful when measured over time as it shows the long-term value of an investment, the most accurate metric for gauging success for most individual investors.






   Examples of Total Shareholder Return (TSR)  

Total shareholder return is calculated as the overall appreciation in the stock's price per share, plus any dividends paid by the company, during a particular measured interval; this sum is then divided by the initial purchase price of the stock to arrive at the TSR.



As a mathematical equation, it would be:



﻿















TSR


=




(


Current Price


−


Purchase Price


)


+


Dividends




Purchase Price










\begin{aligned}&\text{TSR} = \frac { ( \text{Current Price} - \text{Purchase Price} ) + \text{Dividends} }{ \text{Purchase Price} } \\\end{aligned}


​TSR=Purchase Price(Current Price−Purchase Price)+Dividends​​﻿


  Hypothetical Example of TSR  

As an example, let's assume that an investor bought 100 shares of a company's stock at $20 per share (for a total investment of $2,000). The stock, which they still own, is now trading at $24 per share. Since the investor bought the stock two years ago, the company has paid out a total of $4.50 in dividends per share.



What is the investor's TSR over those two years? It would be calculated as



$24 - $20 (current share price minus original purchase price) = 4plus $4.50 (the amount of dividends per share received) = 8.5divided by $20 (original per-share purchase price) = .425multiply by 100 to get a percentage = 42.5%



So the TSR would be 42.5%. As an equation:

TSR​=(($24−$20)+$4.50)÷$20=0.425×100=42.5%​﻿



Note: If you prefer to think of TSR in dollar terms versus percentage, you would simply do the first two steps above, to have $8.50 per share as your total shareholder return, aka "stock return cash value" as it's called in this form.﻿﻿


  Real-Life Example of TSR  

For fiscal year 2020, Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) had a TSR of 59.4% for investors who had held it for that entire period. Of that amount, 57.6% came from an increase in share price, and 1.8% was returned from dividends.﻿﻿






TSR can also be considered the internal rate of return (IRR) of all cash flows to an investor during the period they've held their shares.


   Advantages and Disadvantages of Total Shareholder Return (TSR)  

TSR is best used when analyzing venture capital and private equity investments. These investments typically involve multiple cash investments over the life of the business and a single cash outflow at the end through an initial public offering (IPO) or sale.



Because TSR is expressed as a percentage, the figure is readily comparable with industry benchmarks or companies in the same sector. However, it reflects the past overall return to shareholders without consideration of future returns.



TSR represents an easily understood figure of the overall financial benefits generated for stockholders. The figure measures how the market evaluates the overall performance of a company over a specific time period. However, TSR is calculated for publicly traded companies at the overall level, not at a divisional level. Also, TSR works only for investments with one or more cash inflows after purchase. In addition, TSR is externally focused and reflects the market’s perception of performance; therefore, TSR could be adversely affected if a fundamentally strong company’s share price suffers greatly in the short term for whatever reason—like negative publicity or quirky stock market behavior or sentiment.



TSR does not measure the absolute size of an investment or its return. For this reason, TSR may favor investments with high rates of return even when the dollar amount of the return is small. For example, a $1 investment returning $3 has a higher TSR than a $1 million investment returning $2 million. Also, TSR cannot be used when the investment generates interim cash flows. In addition, TSR does not take into consideration the cost of capital and cannot compare investments over different time periods.





Pros

Simple to calculate, easy to understand
More complete evaluation of investment's worth
Easy to compare to other companies or benchmarks
Good gauge of long-term performance



Cons

Limited to past performance, no sense of future returns
Effective only for investments with cash inflows
Sensitive to stock market sentiment
Doesn't reflect size of investment











What Is Total Shareholder Return?
Total shareholder return (TSR) is a way to evaluate an investment's performance. It factors in capital gains and dividends to measure the overall returns an investor earns from a stock.




How Is TSR Measured?
TSR, short for total shareholder return, measures the appreciation in the price of a stock's shares, plus the total sum paid in dividends per share, over a specific time period.




How Do You Calculate Total Shareholder Return?
To calculate total shareholder return (TSR), first, subtract a stock's current price per share from the price originally paid for it. Then add the dollar amount of dividends received per share, along with any other special distributions or payouts (like from a stock buyback, for example). Divide this sum by the stock's purchase price per share. Multiply by 100 to arrive at a percentage figure for the TSR.


   The Bottom Line  

Total shareholder return (TSR) is a way to determine how much your investment has made for you—how much additional money your capital has earned in a specific time period. It takes into account both appreciation in a stock's shares and the dividends paid on those shares. It has its limitations—what financial metric does not?—but overall, it provides a more complete sense of your return on a stock than simply gaging the gain in the stock price.
What Is Total Utility?  

Total utility is the aggregate amount of satisfaction or fulfillment that a consumer receives through the consumption of a specific good or service. Total utility is often compared to marginal utility, which is the satisfaction a consumer receives from consuming one additional unit of a good or service. Total utility helps economists understand the demand for goods and services.





Key Takeaways

Total utility is the aggregate summation of satisfaction or fulfillment that a consumer receives through the consumption of goods or services.Economists seek to quantify utility and total utility using utils.To best understand total utility, one should understand the Law of Diminishing Marginal Utility, which states that as more of a single good or service is consumed, the additional satisfaction, referred to as marginal utility, drops.Total utility is a core concept studied when seeking to analyze consumer behaviors.In general, economic theories believe that consumer actions are usually based on the goal of total utility maximization, which leads to purchasing units perceived to have the greatest utility satisfaction.


   Understanding Total Utility  

In economics, utility refers to the satisfaction gained from consuming a good or service. Total utility is usually defined as a quantifiable summation of satisfaction or happiness obtained from consuming multiple units of a particular good or service.



Utility and total utility are used in the economic analysis of consumer behaviors within a marketplace. Economists seek to quantify total utility using special calculations. Economists may also study several economic metrics in conjunction with total utility when seeking to understand how consumer behaviors align with supply and demand.



In economics, economists typically view changes in behavior and consumption by analyzing marginal increases and marginal decreases. Marginal changes will usually be either scaled increases or scaled decreases. In the case of total utility, marginal refers to the increasing or decreasing level of utility that is obtained with added consumptions.


   Rational Choice Theory  

Total utility is often studied alongside Rational Choice Theory and the Law of Diminishing Marginal Utility. Rational Choice Theory says that consumers seek to maximize their utility with each unit of consumption. Consumer theory and demand theory suggest that consumer actions are driven toward utility maximization by attempting to acquire the most satisfaction possible in the most affordable way. In general, classical economic theories show that most consumers want to get the highest possible level of utility per unit for the money they spend.



Total utility is usually measured in relative units called utils. When measuring total utility, analysis can span from one unit of consumption to multiple units. For example, a cookie provides a level of utility as determined by its singular consumption, while a bag of cookies may provide total utility over the course of time it takes to completely consume all the cookies in the bag.


   The Law of Diminishing Marginal Utility  

To better understand total utility, one must understand the Law of Diminishing Marginal Utility, which states that as more of a single good or service is consumed, the additional satisfaction, referred to as marginal utility, drops. The first good consumed provides the highest utility, the second good has a lower marginal utility, and so on. Therefore, total utility grows less rapidly with each additional unit consumed of the same good or service.


   How to Calculate Total Utility  

Each individual unit of a good or service has its own utility and each additional unit of consumption will have its own marginal utility. The total utility will be the aggregated sum of utility gained from all units being studied.






"Satisfaction" is a subjective measure and will vary from individual to individual, meaning that total utility acts more as a guide in understanding a consumer's psychological decisions.



A total utility formula will include utils. Utils are typically relative and assigned a base value. Economists usually analyze utils across a spectrum to provide a comparative analysis of the amount of util or satisfaction gained from a unit of consumption. An assigned base value for utils is needed because theoretically there is no real value for utility satisfaction in general.



To find total utility economists use the following basic total utility formula:



TU = U1 + MU2 + MU3 …



TU = Total Utility



U = Utility



MU = Marginal Utility



The total utility is equal to the sum of utils gained from each unit of consumption. In the equation, each unit of consumption is expected to have slightly less utility as more units are consumed.


   Total Utility Maximization  

Economic theory regarding consumer activities suggests that the primary goal of the consumer is to achieve the largest amount of utility for the least amount of cost. This is partly due to the limited amount of funds a person may possess, as well as a desire to achieve as much satisfaction from the consumption of goods and services as possible.



For example, if a consumer is presented with two purchasing options with the same financial cost, and neither option is more necessary or functional than the other, the consumer will choose the good or service that provides the most utility for the money.


   Example of Total Utility  

John is hungry and decides to eat a chocolate bar. His total utility from eating one chocolate bar is 20 utils. He is still hungry so he eats another chocolate bar, where his total utility is 25 utils. John is still hungry and has two more chocolate bars. The third chocolate bar has a total utility of 27 utils, and the fourth has a total utility of 24 utils. This is best represented in the table below.

2 Bars
25 utils


3 Bars
27 utils


4 Bars
24 utils






With each additional chocolate bar, John's total utility increases, until it reaches its max at three chocolate bars. With the fourth chocolate bar, John's total utility decreases. This can be understood with marginal utility; the utility that John derives from each additional chocolate bar.

 24 utils
- 3 utils






With every additional chocolate bar after the first, John's marginal utility is decreasing, meaning that he is deriving less satisfaction from another chocolate bar. This makes sense as he is getting more full with each bar. After the third bar, his marginal utility is negative, meaning he is deriving no satisfaction and in fact is made worse off; perhaps feeling sick after consuming so much chocolate and sugar.


   Total Utility FAQs  
  What Is Total Utility?  

Total utility is the aggregate satisfaction that an individual receives from consuming a specific quantity of a good or service.


  What Is the Relationship Between Total Utility and Marginal Utility?  

While total utility measures the aggregate satisfaction an individual receives from the consumption of a specific quantity of a good or service, marginal utility is the satisfaction an individual receives from consuming one additional unit of a good or service. If marginal utility is positive then total utility will increase. Once marginal utility is negative, then total utility will decrease.


  How Do You Calculate Marginal Utility and Total Utility?  

The basic formula to calculate total utility is as follows:



TU = U1 + MU2 + MU3 …



TU = Total Utility



U = Utility



MU = Marginal Utility



Marginal utility is calculated as follows:



MU = Change in Total Utility / Change in Units


  Does Total Utility Always Increase?  

Total utility does not always increase. When marginal utility is negative, then total utility will decrease. This means that an individual does not derive any satisfaction from the consumption of an additional unit of a good or service and is worse off by doing so.


   The Bottom Line  

Utility measures the satisfaction an individual receives from the consumption of a good or service. Total utility measures the total satisfaction from a specific quantity of goods or services. Total utility operates hand in hand with marginal utility, which measures the additional satisfaction received from the consumption of a good or service. As long as marginal utility is positive, total utility will increase. Once marginal utility is negative, then total utility will decrease.



Economists aim to study total utility and marginal utility to understand consumer behavior. Consumer behavior helps to predict the demand for goods and services, which impacts supply and their prices; all key metrics of analyzing an economy.
What Is a Tracker Fund?  

A tracker fund is an index fund that tracks a broad market index or a segment thereof. Tracker funds are also known as index funds, designed to offer investors exposure to an entire index at a low cost. These funds seek to replicate the holdings and performance of a designated index, constructed as ETFs or alternative investments to meet the fund’s tracking objective.





Key Takeaways

Tracker funds are pooled investments used to track a broad market index or a segment of one; they are also known as index funds.Index fund management is driven by tracking functions, and tracker funds seek to replicate the performance of the market index.Passively managed tracker funds can include customized indexes for market sectors, segments, and themes. Today, market innovation has resulted in the potential for customized tracker funds which provide for more targeted investments. Customized tracking funds are relatively low cost for investors and keep overall expenses lower using an index replication strategy.


   How a Tracker Fund Works  

The term "tracker fund" has evolved from the tracking function that drives index fund management. Tracker funds seek to replicate the performance of a market index. Market innovation has significantly broadened the number of tracker funds available in the investable market.



Investing in an index fund is a form of passive investing. Initially, index funds were introduced to provide investors a low-cost investment vehicle that allows for exposure to the many securities included in a market index. The primary advantage of such a strategy is the lower expense ratio on an index fund. 



Popular indexes for U.S. market exposure include the S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average, and the Nasdaq Composite. Investors often choose traditional tracker funds because a majority of investment fund managers fail to beat broad market indexes on a consistent basis.






The majority of tracker funds are either income or accumulation units. Income is paid out to fund holders as cash, in the former, and in the latter, the income is retained within the fund for reinvestment. 


   Special Considerations  

As markets have evolved over time, investment companies have sought to meet comprehensive demands by developing new and innovative funds and indexes to satisfy investors. As a result many investment companies now work with specialized index providers or create their own customized indexes to use in passively managed funds. With this market evolution, tracker funds now encompass a much broader definition.



Passively managed tracker funds now include customized indexes for market segments, sectors, and themes. Tracker fund strategies have also expanded beyond traditional growth and value index strategies to include indexes screened for a wide range of characteristics and fundamentals. 



Customized tracker funds still seek to track a predefined market index but they provide for much more targeted investment. Offering relatively low costs for investors they are able to keep overall fund expenses lower by continuing to use an index replication strategy while getting many of the benefits of active fund management through screened indexes. 



These funds only need to make significant fund transactions when a customized index reconstitutes which is typically once a year. Customized tracker funds offer investors a broader range of options while also alleviating many of the significant challenges for fund managers in beating the market.


   Examples of Tracker Funds  

Investors will find tracker funds available for nearly every market index in the world. One of the most popular tracker funds is the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY). The fund has $364 billion in assets under management as of June 15, 2021. It has an expense ratio of 0.0945%. The year-to-date return for the SPY through May 31, 2021, was 12.55%, closely matching the S&P 500's total returns. 



Alternatively, many companies develop their own indexes with specified criteria for tracker funds. The Fidelity Quality Factor ETF (FQAL) is an example. The fund tracks a customized index created by Fidelity called the Fidelity U.S. Quality Factor Index.



The Fidelity Quality Factor ETF seeks to replicate the holdings and performance of the Fidelity U.S. Quality Factor Index. The Index utilizes a screening methodology to identify high-quality large-cap and mid-cap stocks. 



Investors get exposure to high-quality U.S. large-cap and mid-cap stocks while the fund requires lower costs due to its index replication construction. As of May 31, 2021, the Fidelity Quality Factor ETF, returned 34.2% over the last twelve months. Meanwhile, the fund underperformed the broad U.S. large and mid-cap universe represented by the Russell 1000, which has a one-year return of 42.52% (as of May 31, 2021).
What Is a Tracking Error?  

Tracking error is the divergence between the price behavior of a position or a portfolio and the price behavior of a benchmark. This is often in the context of a hedge fund, mutual fund, or exchange-traded fund (ETF) that did not work as effectively as intended, creating an unexpected profit or loss.



Tracking error is reported as a standard deviation percentage difference, which reports the difference between the return an investor receives and that of the benchmark they were attempting to imitate.





Key Takeaways

Tracking error is the difference in actual performance between a position (usually an entire portfolio) and its corresponding benchmark.The tracking error can be viewed as an indicator of how actively a fund is managed and its corresponding risk level.Evaluating a past tracking error of a portfolio manager may provide insight into the level of benchmark risk control the manager may demonstrate in the future.

   Understanding a Tracking Error  

Since portfolio risk is often measured against a benchmark, tracking error is a commonly used metric to gauge how well an investment is performing. Tracking error shows an investment's consistency versus a benchmark over a given period of time. Even portfolios that are perfectly indexed against a benchmark behave differently than the benchmark, even though this difference on a day-to-day, quarter-to-quarter, or year-to-year basis may be ever so slight. The measure of tracking error is used to quantify this difference.



Tracking error is the standard deviation of the difference between the returns of an investment and its benchmark. Given a sequence of returns for an investment or portfolio and its benchmark, tracking error is calculated as follows:



Tracking Error = Standard Deviation of (P - B)



Where P is portfolio return and B is benchmark return.



From an investor's point of view, tracking error can be used to evaluate portfolio managers. If a manager is realizing low average returns and has a large tracking error, it is a sign that there is something significantly wrong with that investment and that the investor should most likely find a replacement.



It may also be used to forecast performance, particularly for quantitative portfolio managers who construct risk models that include the likely factors that influence price changes. The managers then construct a portfolio that uses the type of constituents of a benchmark (such as style, leverage, momentum, or market cap) to create a portfolio that will have a tracking error that closely adheres to the benchmark. 


   Special Considerations  
  Factors That Can Affect a Tracking Error  

The net asset value (NAV) of an index fund is naturally inclined toward being lower than its benchmark because funds have fees, whereas an index does not. A high expense ratio for a fund can have a significantly negative impact on the fund's performance. However, it is possible for fund managers to overcome the negative impact of fund fees and outperform the underlying index by doing an above-average job of portfolio rebalancing, managing dividends or interest payments, or securities lending.



Beyond fund fees, a number of other factors can affect a fund's tracking error. One important factor is the extent to which a fund's holdings match the holdings of the underlying index or benchmark. Many funds are made up of just the fund manager's idea of a representative sample of the securities that make up the actual index. There are frequently also differences in weighting between a fund's assets and the assets of the index.



Illiquid or thinly-traded securities can also increase the chance of a tracking error, since this often leads to prices differing significantly from market price when the fund buys or sells such securities as a result of larger bid-ask spreads. Finally, the level of volatility for an index can also affect the tracking error.



Sector, international, and dividend ETFs tend to have higher absolute tracking errors; broad-based equity and bond ETFs tend to have lower ones. Management expense ratios (MER) are the most prominent cause of tracking error and there tends to be a direct correlation between the size of the MER and tracking error. But other factors can intercede and be more significant at times.


  Premiums and Discounts to Net Asset Value  

Premiums or discounts to NAV may occur when investors bid the market price of an ETF above or below the NAV of its basket of securities. Such divergences are usually rare. In the case of a premium, the authorized participant typically arbitrages it away by purchasing securities in the ETF basket, exchanging them for ETF units, and selling the units on the stock market to earn a profit (until the premium is gone). Premiums and discounts as high as 5% have been known to occur, particularly for thinly traded ETFs.


  Optimization  

When there are thinly traded stocks in the benchmark index, the ETF provider can't buy them without pushing their prices up substantially, so it uses a sample containing the more liquid stocks to proxy the index. This is called portfolio optimization.


  Diversification Constraints  

ETFs are registered with regulators as mutual funds and need to abide by the applicable regulations. Of note are two diversification requirements: 75% of its assets must be invested in cash, government securities, and securities of other investment companies, and no more than 5% of the total assets can be invested in any one security.﻿﻿ This can create problems for ETFs tracking the performance of a sector where there are a lot of dominant companies. 


  Cash Drag  

Indexes don't have cash holdings, but ETFs do. Cash can accumulate at intervals due to dividend payments, overnight balances, and trading activity. The lag between receiving and reinvesting the cash can lead to a decline in performance known as drag. Dividend funds with high payout yields are most susceptible.


  Index Changes  

ETFs track indexes and when the indexes are updated, the ETFs have to follow suit. Updating the ETF portfolio incurs transaction costs. And it may not always be possible to do it the same way as the index. For example, a stock added to the ETF may be at a different price than what the index maker selected.


  Capital-Gains Distributions  

ETFs are more tax-efficient than mutual funds but have nevertheless been known to distribute capital gains that are taxable in the hands of unitholders. Although it may not be immediately apparent, these distributions create a different performance than the index on an after-tax basis. Indexes with a high level of turnover in companies (e.g., mergers, acquisitions, and spin-offs) are one source of capital-gains distributions. The higher the turnover rate, the higher the likelihood the ETF will be compelled to sell securities at a profit.


  Securities Lending  

Some ETF companies may offset tracking errors through security lending, which is the practice of lending out holdings in the ETF portfolio to hedge funds for short selling. The lending fees collected from this practice can be used to lower tracking error if so desired.


  Currency Hedging  

International ETFs with currency hedging may not follow a benchmark index due to the costs of currency hedging, which are not always embodied in the MER. Factors affecting hedging costs include market volatility and interest-rate differentials, which impact the pricing and performance of forward contracts. 


  Futures Roll  

Commodity ETFs, in many cases, track the price of a commodity through the futures markets, buying the contract closest to expiry. As the weeks pass and the contract nears expiration, the ETF provider will sell it (to avoid taking delivery) and buy the next month's contract. This operation, known as the "roll," is repeated every month. If contracts further from expiration have higher prices (contango), the roll into the next month will be at a higher price, which incurs a loss. Thus, even if the spot price of the commodity stays the same or rises slightly, the ETF could still show a decline. Vice versa, if futures further away from expiration have lower prices (backwardation), the ETF will have an upward bias. 


  Maintaining Constant Leverage  

﻿Leveraged and inverse ETFs use swaps, forwards, and futures to replicate on a daily basis two or three times the direct or inverse return of a benchmark index. This requires rebalancing the basket of derivatives daily to ensure they deliver the specified multiple of the index's change each day.


   Example of a Tracking Error  

For example, assume that there is a large-cap mutual fund benchmarked to the S&P 500 index. Next, assume that the mutual fund and the index realized the following returns over a given five-year period:



Mutual Fund: 11%, 3%, 12%, 14% and 8%.S&P 500 index: 12%, 5%, 13%, 9% and 7%.



Given this data, the series of differences is then (11% - 12%), (3% - 5%), (12% - 13%), (14% - 9%) and (8% - 7%). These differences equal -1%, -2%, -1%, 5%, and 1%. The standard deviation of this series of differences, the tracking error, is 2.50%.
What Is a Tracking Stock?  

A tracking stock is a special equity offering issued by a parent company that tracks the financial performance of a particular segment or division. Tracking stocks will trade in the open market separately from the parent company's stock.



Tracking stocks allow larger companies to isolate the financial performance of a higher growth segment. In turn, tracking stocks give investors the ability to gain exposure to a specific aspect of a larger company's business (e.g., the mobile division within a large telecom provider).





Key Takeaways

A tracking stock is a specialized equity security issued by a parent company to "track" a certain segment or division of the corporation.A company's tracking stock will trade in the open market independent of the parent stock.The tracking stock's performance will largely be tied to the success of the division it tracks, not the overall company.Companies issue tracking shares in order to raise capital and to give investors the opportunity to gain exposure to one specific division.Tracking stocks carry the same risk as any other stock and typically don't include shareholder voting rights.


   Understanding Tracking Stocks  

When a parent company issues a tracking stock, all revenue and expenses of the applicable division are separated from the parent company's financial statements. The long-term performance of the tracking stock is tied to the financials of the division or segment it follows, not the parent company.



If the division does well financially, the tracking stock will likely appreciate even if the parent company is performing poorly. Conversely, if the division slumps financially, the tracking stock will likely fall even if the parent company is doing well.



Large companies might issue tracking stocks in order to separate a segment that doesn't quite fit with the core business. An example would be a large manufacturing company with a small software development division.



Companies also issue tracking stocks to isolate a high-growth division from the larger slower-growth parent. However, the parent company and its shareholders retain control of the division's operations.



Tracking stocks are registered similarly to common stocks per the regulations enforced by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The issuance and reporting are essentially the same as they are for any new common shares. Companies include a separate section for the tracking stock and the financials of the underlying division in their financial reports.






Tracking stocks were more frequently used in the late 1990s technology boom than they are now, although some companies still issue them today.


   Tracking Stocks Benefits and Risks for Investors  

Tracking stocks allow investors the opportunity to invest in a particular portion of a much larger business. The appreciation potential of well-established conglomerates is often limited due to them having multiple divisions across various business lines. Tracking stocks can give investors access to only the most promising parts of a company.



Tracking stocks also allow investors to participate in the business segments that best fit their own risk tolerance. That said, investors need to be mindful of the risks involved in buying a tracking stock when the parent company is struggling or not well established.



The parent company and its shareholders do not give up control of the tracking segment's operations. Investors of tracking shares typically have limited or no voting rights and in the event of corporate bankruptcy at the parent company, creditors would have a claim on the tracking segment's assets (even if the segment was doing well).


   Tracking Stocks Benefits and Risks for Companies  

Companies raise money through the issuance of tracking stocks. The proceeds can then be used to pay down debt, fund other growth projects, or invest further in the tracking division.



Companies can gauge investor interest in specific segments of the business through the associated activity of each tracking stock. For example, a large-scale telecom giant may choose to use tracking stocks to separate its wireless segment and its landline services. Investor interest in each division can be measured based on the performance of each of the tracking stocks.



Tracking stocks also eliminate the need for management to create a separate business or legal entity for the tracked segment. In a spinoff situation, for example, the separated segment would require its own board of directors and management team.



On the flip side, companies that issue tracking stocks might be parsing out the best parts of their company. If the parent company underperforms financially, the high-growth segment associated with the tracking stock won't be able to help offset that poor performance.





Pros

Tracking stocks give investors access to the more promising divisions of a company.
The performance of tracking stocks comes only from the tracked segment—not from the parent company as a whole.
New issuance of tracking stocks provides companies with capital to pay down debt and fund growth.



Cons

Investors can lose money on tracking stocks if the division performs poorly even if the parent company does well.
Tracking stocks typically come with limited or no voting rights.
If the parent company goes into bankruptcy, creditors may have a claim on the tracking segment's assets (even if it is doing well financially).





   Example of a Tracking Stock  

In 1999, the Walt Disney Company issued a tracking stock for its internet holdings division, Go.com. Go.com's websites included ESPN.com, ABCNews.com, Disney Online, and Disney's Daily Blast. The tracking stock traded under the ticker symbol "GO."



In January 2001, just as the tech bubble was popping, Disney was forced to close Go.com, lay off hundreds of employees, and retire the tracking stock permanently.
What Is Trade?  

Trade is the voluntary exchange of goods or services between different economic actors. Since the parties are under no obligation to trade, a transaction will only occur if both parties consider it beneficial to their interests.



Trade can have more specific meanings in different contexts. In financial markets, trade refers to purchasing and selling securities, commodities, or derivatives. Free trade means international exchanges of products and services without obstruction by tariffs or other trade barriers.





Key Takeaways

Trade refers to the voluntary exchange of goods or services between economic actors.Since transactions are consensual, trade is generally considered to benefit both parties.In finance, trading refers to purchasing and selling securities or other assets.In international trade, the comparative advantage theory states that trade benefits all parties.Most classical economists advocate for free trade, but some development economists believe protectionism has advantages.

   How Trade Works  

As a generic term, trade can refer to any voluntary exchange, from selling baseball cards between collectors to multimillion-dollar contracts between companies.



In macroeconomics, trade usually refers to international trade, the system of exports and imports that connects the global economy. A product sold to the global market is an export, and a product bought from the global market is an import. Exports can account for a significant source of wealth for well-connected economies.



International trade results in increased efficiency and allows countries to benefit from foreign direct investment (FDI) by businesses in other countries. FDI can bring foreign currency and expertise into a country, raising local employment and skill levels. For investors, FDI offers company expansion and growth, eventually leading to higher revenues.



A trade deficit is a situation where a country spends more on aggregate imports from abroad than it earns from its aggregate exports. A trade deficit represents an outflow of domestic currency to foreign markets. This may also be referred to as a negative balance of trade (BOT).

The total value of the global trading market, according to the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development.


   International Trade  

International trade occurs when countries put goods and services on the international market and trade with each other. Without trade between different countries, many modern amenities people expect to have would not be available.


  Comparative Advantage  

Trade seems to be as old as civilization itself—ancient civilizations traded with each other for goods they could not produce for themselves due to climate, natural resources, or other inhibiting factors. The ability of two countries to produce items the other could not and mutually exchange them led to the principle of comparative advantage.



This principle, commonly known as the Law of Comparative Advantage, is popularly attributed to English political economist David Ricardo and his book On the Principles of Political Economy and Taxation in 1817. However, Ricardo's mentor James Mill likely originated the analysis.



Ricardo famously showed how England and Portugal benefited by specializing and trading according to their comparative advantages. In this case, Portugal was able to make wine at a low cost, while England was able to manufacture cloth cheaply. By focusing on their comparative advantages, both countries could consume more goods through trade than they could in isolation.






The first long-distance trade is thought to have occurred 5,000 years ago between Mesopotamia and the Indus Valley.



The theory of comparative advantage helps to explain why protectionism is often counterproductive. While a country can use tariffs and other trade barriers to benefit specific industries or interest groups, these policies also prevent their consumers from enjoying the benefits of cheaper goods from abroad. Eventually, that country would be economically disadvantaged relative to countries that conduct trade.


  Example of Comparative Advantage  

Comparative advantage is one country's ability to produce something better and more efficiently than others. Whatever the item is, it becomes a powerful bargaining tool because it can be used as a trade incentive for trading partners.



When two countries trade, they can each have a comparative advantage and benefit each other. For instance, imagine a country that has limited natural resources. One day, a shepherd stumbled upon an abundant cheap and renewable energy source only occurring within that country's borders that could provide enough clean energy for its neighboring countries for centuries. As a result, this country would suddenly have a comparative advantage it could market to trading partners.



Imagine a neighboring country has a booming lumber trade and can manufacture building supplies much cheaper than the country with the new energy source, but it consumes a lot of energy to do so. The two countries have comparative advantages that can be traded beneficially for both.


   Benefits of Trade  

Because countries are endowed with different assets and natural resources, some may produce the same good more efficiently and sell it more cheaply than others. Countries that trade can take advantage of the lower prices available in other countries.



Here are some other benefits of trade:



It increases a nation's global standingIt raises a nation's profitabilityCreates jobs in import and export sectorsExpands products varietyEncourages investment in a country globally


   Criticisms of Trade  

While the law of comparative advantage is a regular feature of introductory economics, many countries try to shield local industries with tariffs, subsidies, or other trade barriers. One possible explanation comes from what economists call rent-seeking. Rent-seeking occurs when one group organizes and lobbies the government to protect its interests.



For example, business owners might pressure their country's government for tariffs to protect their industry from inexpensive foreign goods, which could cost the livelihoods of domestic workers. Even if the business owners understand trade benefits, they could be reluctant to sacrifice a lucrative income stream.



Moreover, there are strategic reasons for countries to avoid excessive reliance on free trade. For example, a country that relies on trade might become too dependent on the global market for critical goods.



Some development economists have argued for tariffs to help protect infant industries that cannot yet compete on the global market. As those industries grow and mature, they are expected to become a comparative advantage for their country.




What Are the Types of Trade?
Generally, there are two types of trade—domestic and international. Domestic trades occur between parties in the same countries. International trade occurs between two or more countries. A country that places goods and services on the international market is exporting those goods and services. One that purchases goods and services from the international market is importing those goods and services.




What Is the Importance of Trade?
Trade is essential for many reasons, but some of the most commonly cited ones are lowering prices, becoming or remaining competitive, developing relationships, fueling growth, reducing inflation, encouraging investment, and supporting better-paying jobs.




What Are the Advantages and Disadvantages of Trade?
Trade offers many advantages, such as increasing quality of life and fueling economic growth. However, trade can be used politically through embargoes and tariffs to manipulate trade partners. It also comes with language barriers, cultural differences, and restrictions on what can be imported or exported. Additionally, intellectual property theft becomes an issue because regulations and enforcement methods change across borders.


   The Bottom Line  

Trade is the exchange of goods and services between parties for mutually beneficial purposes. People and countries trade to improve their circumstances and quality of life. It also develops relationships between governments and fosters friendship and trust.
What Is Trade Credit?  

Trade credit is a business-to-business (B2B) agreement in which a customer can purchase goods without paying cash up front, and paying the supplier at a later scheduled date. Usually, businesses that operate with trade credits will give buyers 30, 60, or 90 days to pay, with the transaction recorded through an invoice.



Trade credit can be thought of as a type of 0% financing, increasing a company’s assets while deferring payment for a specified value of goods or services to some time in the future and requiring no interest to be paid in relation to the repayment period.





Key Takeaways


Trade credit is a type of commercial financing in which a customer is allowed to purchase goods or services and pay the supplier at a later scheduled date.
Trade credit can be a good way for businesses to free up cash flow and finance short-term growth.
Trade credit can create complexity for financial accounting depending on the accounting method used.
Trade credit financing is usually encouraged globally by regulators and can create opportunities for new financial technology solutions.
Suppliers are usually at a disadvantage with a trade credit as they have sold goods but not received payment.

   Understanding Trade Credit  

Trade credit is an advantage for a buyer. In some cases, certain buyers may be able to negotiate longer trade credit repayment terms, which provides an even greater advantage. Often, sellers will have specific criteria for qualifying for trade credit.



A B2B trade credit can help a business to obtain, manufacture, and sell goods before ever having to pay for them. This allows businesses to receive a revenue stream that can retroactively cover costs of goods sold. Walmart is one of the biggest utilizers of trade credit, seeking to pay retroactively for inventory sold in their stores. International business deals also involve trade credit terms. In general, if trade credit is offered to a buyer it typically always provides an advantage for a company’s cash flow.



The number of days for which a credit is given is determined by the company allowing the credit and is agreed upon by both the company allowing the credit and the company receiving it. Trade credit can also be an essential way for businesses to finance short-term growth. Because trade credit is a form of credit with no interest, it can often be used to encourage sales.



Since trade credit puts suppliers at somewhat of a disadvantage, many suppliers use discounts when trade credits are involved to encourage early payments. A supplier may give a discount if a customer pays within a certain number of days before the due date. For example, a 2% discount if payment is received within 10 days of issuing a 30-day credit. This discount would be referred to as 2%/10 net 30 or simply just 2/10 net 30.


   Trade Credit Accounting  

Trade credits are accounted for by both sellers and buyers. Accounting with trade credits can differ based on whether a company uses cash accounting or accrual accounting. Accrual accounting is required for all public companies. With accrual accounting, a company must recognize revenues and expenses at the time they are transacted.



Trade credit invoicing can make accrual accounting more complex. If a public company offers trade credits it must book the revenue and expenses associated with the sale at the time of the transaction. When trade credit invoicing is involved, companies do not immediately receive cash assets to cover expenses. Therefore, companies must account for the assets as accounts receivable on their balance sheet.



With trade credit, there is the possibility of default. Companies offering trade credits also usually offer discounts, which means they can receive less than the accounts receivable balance. Both defaults and discounts can require the need for accounts receivable write-offs from defaults or write-downs from discounts. These are considered liabilities a company must expense.



Alternatively, trade credit is a useful option for businesses on the buying side. A company can obtain assets but would not need to credit cash or recognize any expenses immediately. In this way, trade credit can act like a 0% loan on the balance sheet.



The company’s assets increase but cash does not need to be paid until some time in the future and no interest is charged during the repayment period. A company only needs to recognize the expense when cash is paid using the cash method or when revenue is received using the accrual method. Overall, these activities greatly free up cash flow for the buyer.


   Trade Credit Trends  

Trade credit is most rewarding for businesses that do not have a lot of financing options. In financial technology, new types of point of sale financing options are being provided for businesses to utilize in place of trade credits. Many of these fintech firms partner with sellers at the point of sale to provide 0% or low-interest financing on purchases. These partnerships help to alleviate trade credit risks for sellers while also supporting growth for buyers.



Trade credit has also brought about new financing solutions for sellers in the form of accounts receivable financing. Accounts receivable financing, also known as invoice financing or factoring, is a type of financing that provides businesses with capital in relation to their trade credit, accounts receivable balances.



From an international standpoint, trade credit is encouraged. The World Trade Organization reports that 80% to 90% of world trade is in some way reliant on trade finance. Trade finance insurance is also a part of many trade finance discussions globally with many new innovations. LiquidX for example now offers an electronic marketplace focused on trade credit insurance for global participants.



Research conducted by the U.S. Federal Reserve Banks also highlights some important insights. The 2022 Small Business Credit Survey finds that trade credit finance is the third most popular financing tool used by small businesses with 9% of businesses reporting that they utilize it.


   Related Concepts and Other Considerations  

Trade credit has a significant impact on the financing of businesses and is therefore linked to other financing terms and concepts. Other important terms that affect business financing are credit rating, trade line, and buyer’s credit.



A credit rating is an overall assessment of the creditworthiness of a borrower, whether a business or individual, based on financial history that includes debt repayment timeliness and other factors. Without a good credit rating, trade credit may not be offered to a business.



If businesses do not pay trade credit balances according to agreed terms, penalties in the form of fees and interest are usually incurred. Sellers can also report delinquencies on trade credit, which may affect a buyer’s credit rating. Delinquencies affecting a buyer’s credit rating can also affect their ability to obtain other types of financing as well.






Trade credit is usually only available for businesses with an established credit history. New businesses without a credit history may have to look at other means of financing.



A trade line, or tradeline, is a business credit account record provided to a business credit reporting agency. For large businesses and public companies, trade lines can be followed by rating agencies such as Standard & Poor’s, Moody’s, or Fitch.



Buyer’s credit is related to international trade and is essentially a loan given to specifically finance the purchase of capital goods and services. Buyer’s credit involves different agencies across borders and typically has a minimum loan amount of several million dollars. 


   Advantages and Disadvantages of Trade Credit  
  Buyers  

The advantages of trade credit for buyers include simple and easy access to financing. It is also an affordable type of financing that comes at no extra cost when compared to other means of financing, such as a loan from a bank.



Because payment is not due till later, trade credits improve the cash flow of businesses; they can sell the goods they acquired without having to pay for those goods till a later date. Trade credits also improve your business profile as well as your relationship with your vendors.



The disadvantages of trade credit include high costs if payments are not made on time. Costs usually appear in the form of late-payment penalty charges or interest charges on the outstanding debt. If payments are not made, this can also negatively impact the credit profile of your business as well as the relationship with your supplier.


  Sellers  

The advantages of trade credits for sellers include building a strong relationship with your clients, encouraging customer loyalty, and, therefore, repeat business. Trade credits can also lead to higher sales volumes as buyers are likely to purchase more when there is no cost associated with the financing.



Sellers have a few more disadvantages than buyers when it comes to trade credits. These include delayed revenue. If a business is flush with cash, that's not a problem. If budgets are tight then delayed revenue might be an issue in terms of covering operating costs.



Trade credits also come with bad debts as some buyers will inevitably not be able to pay. This means a business takes on risks when extending financing. Bad debts can be written off, but having a customer not pay can always be detrimental to a business.





Pros

Cost-effective means of financing for buyers
Improves cash flow for buyers
Encourages higher sales volumes for sellers
Leads to strong relationships and customer loyalty for sellers



Cons

High cost for buyers if payments are not made on time
Late payments or bad debts can negatively impact a buyer's credit profile and relationship with suppliers
Sellers run the risk of buyers not paying their debts
Delayed payments can be a strain on the balance sheet for sellers





   Trade Credit FAQs  
  What Are the Most Common Terms for Using Trade Credit?  

The most common terms for using trade credit require a buyer to make payment within seven, 30, 60, 90, or 120 days. A percentage discount is applied if payment is made before the date agreed to in the terms.


  What Type of Credit Is Trade Credit?  

Trade credit is commercial financing whereby a business is able to buy goods without having to pay till later. Commercial financing in relation to a trade credit comes at a 0% borrowing cost.


  What Are the Types of Trade Credit?  

Trade credits can come in the form of open accounts, promissory notes, or bills payable. An open account is an informal agreement where the seller sends the goods and an invoice to the buyer. A promissory note is a formal agreement where the buyer agrees to the terms, including the payment date, and signs and returns the document to the seller. Bills payable refer to financial instruments drawn by the seller and accepted by the buyer with an agreement of payment on the expiry date.


  Is Trade Credit Expensive?  

In its purest form, trade credit is not expensive to the buyer as there is no associated cost. Trade credit is an interest-free loan. However, trade credit can be expensive if payment is not made by the agreed-upon date, whereby a borrower can incur high costs, either through late fees or an interest rate charged by the seller on the outstanding amount.


   The Bottom Line  

Trade credit is a form of commercial financing that greatly benefits businesses in their operations. It is an interest-free loan for a buyer, allowing them to obtain goods with payment due at a later date at no extra charge. This allows for improved cash flows and the avoidance of traditional costs associated with financing.
What Is a Trade Deficit?  

A trade deficit occurs when a country's imports exceed its exports during a given time period. It is also referred to as a negative balance of trade (BOT).



The balance can be calculated on different categories of transactions: goods (a.k.a., “merchandise”), services, goods and services. Balances are also calculated for international transactions—current account, capital account, and financial account.





Key Takeaways

A trade deficit occurs when a country's imports exceed its exports during a given period.Balances are calculated for several categories of international transactionsTrade deficits can be shorter or longer term.Implications of a trade deficit depend on impacts on production, jobs, national security and how the deficits are financed.


   Understanding Trade Deficits  

A trade deficit occurs when there is a negative net amount or negative balance in an international transaction account. The balance of payments (international transaction accounts) records all economic transactions between residents and non-residents where a change in ownership occurs.



A trade deficit or net amount can be calculated on different categories within an international transaction account. These include goods, services, goods and services, current account, and the sum of balances on the current and capital accounts.



The sum of the balances on the current and capital accounts equals net lending/borrowing.



This also equals the balance on the financial account plus a statistical discrepancy. The financial account measures financial assets and liabilities, in contrast to purchases and payments in the current and capital accounts.

The most relevant balance depends on the question being asked and the country about which it is being asked. In the U.S., the International Transaction Accounts are published by the Bureau of Economic Analysis.



The current account includes goods and services, plus primary and secondary income payments.



Primary income includes payments (financial investment returns) from direct investment (greater than 10% ownership of a business), portfolio investment (financial markets), and other.



Secondary income payments include government grants (foreign aid) and pension payments, and private remittances to households in other countries (e.g., sending money to friends and relatives).



The capital account includes exchanges of assets such as insured disaster-related losses, debt cancellation, and transactions involving rights, like mineral, trademark, or franchise.



The balance of the current account and capital account determines the exposure of an economy to the rest of the world, whereas the financial account (tracking financial assets, rather than products or income flows) explains how it is financed. In principle, the sum of the balances of the three accounts should be zero, but there is a statistical discrepancy because of source data used for the current and capital accounts is different from the source data used for the financial account.



Trade deficits occur when a country lacks efficient capacity to produce its own products – whether due to lack of skill and resources to create that capacity or due to preference to acquire from another country (such as to specialize in its own goods, for lower cost or to acquire luxuries).


   Advantages of Trade Deficits  

The most obvious benefit of a trade deficit is that it allows a country to consume more than it produces. In the short run, trade deficits can help nations to avoid shortages of goods and other economic problems.



In some countries, trade deficits correct themselves over time. A trade deficit creates downward pressure on a country's currency under a floating exchange rate regime. With a cheaper domestic currency, imports become more expensive in the country with the trade deficit. Consumers react by reducing their consumption of imports and shifting toward domestically produced alternatives. Domestic currency depreciation also makes the country's exports less expensive and more competitive in foreign markets.



Trade deficits can also occur because a country is a highly desirable destination for foreign investment. For example, the U.S. dollar's status as the world's reserve currency creates a strong demand for U.S. dollars. Foreigners must sell goods to Americans to obtain dollars. According to the U.S. Treasury Department, foreign investors held over four trillion dollars in Treasuries as of October 2019. Other nations had to run cumulative trade surpluses with the U.S. totaling over four trillion dollars to buy those Treasuries. The stability of developed countries generally attracts capital, while less developed countries must worry about capital flight.


   Disadvantages of Trade Deficits  

Trade deficits can create substantial problems in the long run. The worst and most obvious problem is that trade deficits can facilitate a sort of economic colonization. If a country continually runs trade deficits, citizens of other countries acquire funds to buy up capital in that nation. That can mean making new investments that increase productivity and create jobs. However, it may also involve merely buying up existing businesses, natural resources, and other assets. If this buying continues, foreign investors will eventually own nearly everything in the country.



Trade deficits are generally much more dangerous with fixed exchange rates. Under a fixed exchange rate regime, devaluation of the currency is impossible, trade deficits are more likely to continue, and unemployment may increase significantly. According to the twin deficits hypothesis, there is also a link between trade deficits and budget deficits. Some economists believe that the European debt crisis was caused in part by some EU members running persistent trade deficits with Germany. Exchange rates can no longer adjust between countries in the Eurozone, making trade deficits a more serious problem.


   Real World Example  

The U.S. holds the distinction of having the world's largest trade deficit since 1975. The U.S. imported and consumed significantly more electronics, raw materials, oil, and other items than it sold to foreign countries.
What Is Trade Finance?  

Trade finance represents the financial instruments and products that are used by companies to facilitate international trade and commerce. Trade finance makes it possible and easier for importers and exporters to transact business through trade. Trade finance is an umbrella term meaning it covers many financial products that banks and companies utilize to make trade transactions feasible.

Key Takeaways

Trade finance represents the financial instruments and products that are used by companies to facilitate international trade and commerce. Trade finance makes it possible and easier for importers and exporters to transact business through trade. Trade finance can help reduce the risk associated with global trade by reconciling the divergent needs of an exporter and importer. 


   How Trade Finance Works  

The function of trade finance is to introduce a third-party to transactions to remove the payment risk and the supply risk. Trade finance provides the exporter with receivables or payment according to the agreement while the importer might be extended credit to fulfill the trade order. 



The parties involved in trade finance are numerous and can include:



Banks
Trade finance companies
Importers and exporters
Insurers
Export credit agencies and service providers



Trade financing is different than conventional financing or credit issuance. General financing is used to manage solvency or liquidity, but trade financing may not necessarily indicate a buyer's lack of funds or liquidity. Instead, trade finance may be used to protect against international trade's unique inherent risks, such as currency fluctuations, political instability, issues of non-payment, or the creditworthiness of one of the parties involved.



Below are a few of the financial instruments used in trade finance:



Lending lines of credit can be issued by banks to help both importers and exporters.Letters of credit reduce the risk associated with global trade since the buyer's bank guarantees payment to the seller for the goods shipped. However, the buyer is also protected since payment will not be made unless the terms in the LC are met by the seller. Both parties have to honor the agreement for the transaction to go through.Factoring is when companies are paid based on a percentage of their accounts receivables.Export credit or working capital can be supplied to exporters.Insurance can be used for shipping and the delivery of goods and can also protect the exporter from nonpayment by the buyer.



Although international trade has been in existence for centuries, trade finance facilitates its advancement. The widespread use of trade finance has contributed to international trade growth.



"Some 80% to 90% of world trade relies on trade finance..." – World Trade Organization (WTO)


   How Trade Financing Reduces Risk  

Trade finance can help reduce the risk associated with global trade by reconciling the divergent needs of an exporter and importer. Ideally, an exporter would prefer the importer to pay upfront for an export shipment to avoid the risk that the importer takes the shipment but refuses to pay for the goods. However, if the importer pays the exporter upfront, the exporter may accept the payment but refuse to ship the goods.



A common solution to this problem is for the importer’s bank to provide a letter of credit to the exporter's bank that provides for payment once the exporter presents documents that prove the shipment occurred, like a bill of lading. The letter of credit guarantees that once the issuing bank receives proof that the exporter shipped the goods and the terms of the agreement have been met, it will issue the payment to the exporter.



With the letter of credit, the buyer's bank assumes the responsibility of paying the seller. The buyer's bank would have to ensure the buyer was financially viable enough to honor the transaction. Trade finance helps both importers and exporters build trust in dealing with each other and thus facilitating trade.






Trade finance allows both importers and exporters access to many financial solutions that can be tailored to their situation, and often, multiple products can be used in tandem or layered to help ensure the transaction goes through smoothly.


   Other Benefits to Trade Finance  

Besides reducing the risk of nonpayment and non-receipt of goods, trade finance has become an important tool for companies to improve their efficiency and boost revenue.


  Improves Cash Flow and Efficiency of Operations  

Trade finance helps companies obtain financing to facilitate business but also it is an extension of credit in many cases. Trade finance allows companies to receive a cash payment based on accounts receivables in case of factoring. A letter of credit might help the importer and exporter to enter a trade transaction and reduce the risk of nonpayment or non-receipt of goods. As a result, cash flow is improved since the buyer's bank guarantees payment, and the importer knows the goods will be shipped.



In other words, trade finance ensures fewer delays in payments and in shipments allowing both importers and exporters to run their businesses and plan their cash flow more efficiently. Think of trade finance as using the shipment or trade of goods as collateral for financing the company's growth.


  Increased Revenue and Earnings   

Trade finance allows companies to increase their business and revenue through trade. For example, a U.S. company that can land a sale with a company overseas might not have the ability to produce the goods needed for the order.



However, through export financing or help from private or governmental trade finance agencies, the exporter can complete the order. As a result, the U.S. company gets new business that it might not have had without the creative financial solutions that trade finance provides.


  Reduce the Risk of Financial Hardship  

Without trade financing, a company might fall behind on payments and lose a key customer or supplier that could have long-term ramifications for the company. Having options like revolving credit facilities and accounts receivables factoring can not only help companies transact internationally but also help them in times of financial difficulties.
What Is Trade Liberalization?  

Trade liberalization is the removal or reduction of restrictions or barriers on the free exchange of goods between nations. These barriers include tariffs, such as duties and surcharges, and nontariff barriers, such as licensing rules and quotas. Economists often view the easing or eradication of these restrictions as steps to promote free trade.





Key Takeaways

Trade liberalization removes or reduces barriers to trade among countries, such as tariffs and quotas.Having fewer barriers to trade reduces the cost of goods sold in importing countries.Trade liberalization can benefit stronger economies but put weaker ones at a greater disadvantage.


   Understanding Trade Liberalization  

Trade liberalization is a controversial topic. Critics of trade liberalization claim that the policy can cost jobs because cheaper goods will flood the nation's domestic market. Critics also suggest that the goods can be of inferior quality and less safe than competing domestic products that may have undergone more rigorous safety and quality checks.



Proponents of trade liberalization, however, claim that it ultimately lowers consumer costs, increases efficiency, and fosters economic growth. Protectionism, the opposite of trade liberalization, is characterized by strict barriers and market regulation. The outcome of trade liberalization and the resulting integration among countries is known as globalization.


   Advantages and Disadvantages of Trade Liberalization  

Trade liberalization promotes free trade, which allows countries to trade goods without regulatory barriers or their associated costs. This reduced regulation decreases costs for countries that trade with other nations and may, ultimately, result in lower consumer prices because imports are subject to lower fees and competition is likely to increase. 



Increased competition from abroad as a result of trade liberalization creates an incentive for greater efficiency and cheaper production by domestic firms. This competition might also spur a country to shift resources to industries in which it may have a competitive advantage. For example, trade liberalization has encouraged the United Kingdom to concentrate on its service sector rather than manufacturing.



However, trade liberalization can negatively affect certain businesses within a nation because of greater competition from foreign producers and may result in less local support for those industries. There may also be a financial and social risk if products or raw materials come from countries with lower environmental standards.



Trade liberalization can pose a threat to developing nations or economies because they are forced to compete in the same market as stronger economies or nations. This challenge can stifle established local industries or result in the failure of newly developed industries there.



Countries with advanced education systems tend to adapt rapidly to a free-trade economy because they have a labor market that can adjust to changing demands and production facilities that can shift their focus to more in-demand goods. Countries with lower educational standards may struggle to adapt to a changing economic environment.






Critics believe that trade liberalization costs jobs and depresses wages. Proponents believe it spurs competition and growth.


   Trade Liberalization Example  

The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) was signed on Dec. 17, 1992, by Canada, Mexico, and the United States. It entered into force on Jan. 1, 1994.﻿﻿ The agreement eliminated the tariffs on products that were traded among the three countries. One of NAFTA's goals was to integrate Mexico with the highly developed economies of the United States and Canada, in part because Mexico was considered a lucrative new market for Canada and the United States. The three governments also hoped that the trade deal would improve Mexico's economy.﻿﻿



Over time, regional trade tripled, and cross-border investment increased among the countries. However, Former President Donald J. Trump considered the agreement detrimental to U.S. jobs and manufacturing. On Sept. 30, 2018, the Trump administration concluded negotiations on an updated pact, the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), which entered into force on July 1, 2020.﻿﻿ 



Most economists agree that NAFTA was beneficial to the Canadian and U.S. economies. According to a Council on Foreign Relations report, regional trade increased from $290 billion in 1993 to over $1.1 trillion in 2016, and U.S. foreign direct investment (FDI) stock in Mexico increased from $15 billion to more than $100 billion. However, economists also say that other factors may also have contributed to these outcomes, such as technological change and extended trade with China.﻿﻿



Critics of NAFTA argue that the agreement caused job losses and wage stagnation in the United States because companies moved their production to Mexico to take advantage of lower labor costs.﻿﻿ It remains to be seen how the USMCA will affect these factors.
What Is a Trade Line?  

A trade line is a record of activity for any type of credit extended to a borrower and reported to a credit reporting agency. A trade line is established on a borrower’s credit report when a borrower is approved for credit. The trade line records all of the activity associated with an account.



Comprehensively, trade lines are used by credit reporting agencies to calculate a borrower’s credit score. Different credit reporting agencies give differing weights to the activities of trade lines when establishing a credit score for borrowers.





Key Takeaways

A trade line is created on a borrower’s credit report to keep track of all the activity on the account.A trade line is created for every line of credit or account a debtor has such as a mortgage, car loan, student loan, credit card, or personal loan.Trade lines include information on the creditor, the lender, and the type of credit given.A closed credit account will generally remain on a trade line for seven to 10 years.A trade line includes all relevant information used to determine your credit score. It is important to review your trade line to ensure all information is valid and free from error.


   How a Trade Line Works  

A trade line is an important record-keeping mechanism that tracks the activity of borrowers on their credit reports. Each credit account has its own trade line. Borrowers will have multiple trade lines on their credit report, each representing the individual borrowing accounts for which they have been approved.



The basic types of accounts that have a trade line are those paid off in fixed installments, and these accounts are often broken into categories. First, revolving trade lines are reported on credit cards or other lines of credit. Second, installment trade lines report the history of car loans, mortgages, student loans, and personal loans. Open accounts, a third type of account on a trade line, are often associated with businesses as opposed to individuals.






Should a trade line be created in your name fraudulently, you can request to have the trade line removed from your credit history.


   Records Included in a Trade Line  

Trade lines may contain a variety of different data points related to the creditor, the lender, and the type of credit that is being provided. The trade line often contains the name of the creditor or lender, the account or another identifier for the type of credit being provided, the parties responsible for paying the loan, and the payment status of the account.



The trade line will also contain particular account milestones, such as the date the credit was extended, the credit limit, the payment history, all levels of delinquency if any missed payments have occurred, and the total amount owed as of the last report. If a consumer closes an account, that account will typically remain on his or her credit report as a trade line for seven years, though in some cases the account can go away sooner.



Payment status indicates whether or not payments for the loan are being made on time and how late they are if they are not being made on time. If the payments are being made on time, the payment status will indicate that the payments are being made according to the terms of the credit agreement.






The information included in your trade lines is used to calculate your credit scores. While your credit score is a summarized snapshot of your creditworthiness, lenders may inquire to see a detailed report of your entire trade line.


   Special Considerations  

Late payments are usually grouped in a range of days according to how late they are. For example, delinquencies may be reported as 30 days late, 60 days late, or 90 days late. The payment status may be set to “charge off” if the creditor deems it unlikely that the debt will be repaid, and the status may also indicate that the credit recipient has entered bankruptcy.



As trade lines are used by credit reporting agencies to develop an individual’s credit score, credit scores vary, with higher scores generally given to individuals with more-favorable trade line reporting. Factors considered when calculating the credit score include the number of trade lines, types of trade lines, lengths of open accounts, and payment history.



In addition to reviewing a borrower’s credit score, a lender who pulls data from a credit-reporting agency may also comprehensively analyze all of the trade line reporting on a credit report when considering a credit application in the underwriting process.


  FICO Credit Score  

When applying for credit, your lender will often request your credit score as part of the approval process. Your FICO score is directly determined from the information listed on each trade line. Below is how your FICO score is calculated and how each section relates to trade lines.



Payment History (35%): Trade lines include debt or lines of credit that have been closed for up to 10 years.Amounts Owed (30%): Trade lines are created for every line of credit. Each line of credit, revolving line, or installment agreement has its own trade line.Length of Credit History (15%): Trade lines include every payment you've ever made against every account or line. This also includes every installment payment you've missed.New Credit (10%): Trade lines are generally created within a month of the first payment being made on the associated line or account.Credit Mix (10%): Trade lines are created for a variety of types of accounts including mortgages, car loans, credit cards, student loans, and personal loans.




What Is a Trade Line?
A trade line is a summary on every revolving or installment credit you have. This detailed report outlines your creditworthiness by communicating to creditors and lenders your payment history, your credit history, and your delinquencies.




What Is an Example of a Trade Line?
A trade line is created for every credit line you own. An example of a trade line is your car payment history. When you begin repaying a car loan, a trade line is created that summarizes your contact information, your current payment status, the date the line of credit was opened, and the date the line was closed.The trade line will also report current information such as the date of your last payment, the current balance remaining, and your monthly payment amount.




Can Trade Lines Hurt Your Credit?
Yes, trade lines communicate to lenders your prior creditworthiness and details how much debt you have, what your current minimum monthly payments are, and what your historical payment delinquencies are.




How Do You Get a Trade Line?
A trade line is automatically created for you when a new line of credit is started. For example, when you sign up for a new credit card, a new trade line is created specific to that individual line of credit. As you incur purchases on the card and pay off debt balances, a record of history is created.




How Long Do Trade Lines Last?
Trade lines may show up on your credit report as soon as 15 days after the time of purchase. Alternatively, a trade line may be delayed on showing on your report up to 45 days depending on the timing of the purchase.Each credit reporting agency may have varying terms on how long a trade line is maintained. In general, a trade line is often maintained on your account 10 years after the trade line has been closed. Trade lines with a negative history are generally closed between seven to 10 years.Trade lines for fraudulent or erroneous reports can be disputed. After credit bureau agencies receive valid proof, these trade lines are often removed within 30 days of review.
What Is a Trade Sanction?  

Trade sanctions are legal restrictions on trade with a country. Trade sanctions are a subcategory of economic sanctions, which are economic penalties imposed on a country to accomplish policy goals beyond the sanctioned economic activity.





Key Takeaways

Trade sanctions are restrictions on trade with a country for reasons of foreign policy. Trade sanctions can be imposed to alter objectionable policies or to punish them.Export and import restrictions are the most common type of trade sanction.The embargo is the most severe trade sanction as a blanket prohibition on trade.Tariffs and quotas can also be used as trade sanctions but more frequently shield domestic producers from foreign competition.


   Understanding Trade Sanctions  

Trade sanctions can be used to punish a particular policy or to increase its costs and encourage a change in behavior. Sanctions may be unilateral, imposed by a single country, or multilateral if agreed by multiple nations. Sanctions may be also be adopted by international organizations such as the United Nations Security Council.



Multilateral sanctions can be particularly effective, but even unilateral sanctions imposed by a major economic power like the U.S. can mobilize broad public support while providing an alternative to the use of military force.



Critics of sanctions often cite the harm they can do to civilians not responsible for their government's policies. Trade sanctions also hurt the sanctioned countries' trade partners from the sanctioning jurisdictions.


   Trade Sanction Mechanisms   

The most common types of trade sanctions are non-tariff barriers (NTBs) and embargoes. Non-tariff barriers may include export licensing regimes or outright export and import bans for specified products and services. Quotas and tariffs are not typically deployed as sanctions, though they can be altered or maintained as part of a sanctions regime. Asset freezes and seizures are part of the broader economic sanctions toolbox and can certainly hinder trade, but are not a trade sanction specifically,


  Embargoes  

An embargo is the most severe trade sanction, as a general prohibition of most trade with the sanctioned country. For example, the U.S. maintains trade embargoes against Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Syria, and Russian-occupied Crimea in Ukraine, barring all imports and exports without a license authorization from the U.S. government.


  Export Restrictions  

Export restrictions, including licensing requirements and outright bans, typically target advanced technology transfers to government or private trade partners in a sanctioned country. They often target industries implicated in the actions under sanction and others considered particularly valuable to the sanctioned country.



For example, in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the U.S. government in February 2022 restricted U.S. exports to Russia as well as third-party exports using U.S. technology in semiconductors, telecommunication, encryption security, lasers, sensors, navigation, avionics, and maritime technologies. In March 2022, the U.S. banned exports of oil and gas refining technology to Russia and imposed sweeping export restrictions on Belarus for that country's role in aiding the Russian invasion.


  Import Restrictions  

Import restrictions and outright bans target the import of products or services from the sanctioned country. Proposals to ban imports of Russian crude oil in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine shook global energy markets in March 2022. Standing European Union bans on imports of Syrian weapons and Somali charcoal have attracted less attention.


  Tariffs and Quotas  

Because tariffs and quotas limit trade but don't ban it entirely, they are more often used to curb trade flows out of economic motivations (such as encouraging domestic employment, for example) rather the for reasons of foreign policy. U.S. use of tariffs as a foreign policy tool expanded dramatically during the Trump administration.



Still, economic sanctions have been incorporated into U.S. tariff and quota regimes for a long time. The Jackson-Vanik amendment to the Trade Act of 1974 sought to withhold the most-favored-nation status guaranteeing non-discriminatory tariffs from non-market economies restricting emigration. Initially applied to the Soviet Union and China, the Jackson-Vanik amendment was repealed for China in 2000 and supplanted for Russia and Moldova by the Magnitsky Act of 2012. The Jackson-Vanik amendment remains in force for Azerbaijan, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and Turkmenistan.



Trade quotas are a less common sanctions tool than tariffs, but have been used as well. In 1983 the U.S. cut Nicaragua's sugar import quota by 90% as part of an effort to oust the country's government. The quota was restored in 1990.


   The Bottom Line  

Western leadership in global trade and advanced technologies makes trade sanctions an attractive policy alternative to the use of force in international disputes.



The effectiveness of trade sanctions depends on how widely they are adopted by the sanctioned country's trading partners, and the degree to which they target its most valuable industries and leadership. The effectiveness of sanctions also depends on the responses of the sanctioned country.



The effectiveness of trade sanctions is not confined to instances of a sanctioned country reversing policies to have sanctions lifted, though that has happened, notably in apartheid-era South Africa. Sanctions can be considered effective if their outcome is preferable to the expected outcome in their absence, or even if they merely impose costs on the sanctioned country and register the sanctioning country's disapproval.
What Is a Trade Secret?  

A trade secret is any practice or process of a company that is generally not known outside of the company. Information considered a trade secret gives the company a competitive advantage over its competitors and is often a product of internal research and development.



To be legally considered a trade secret in the United States, a company must make a reasonable effort in concealing the information from the public; the secret must intrinsically have economic value, and the trade secret must contain information. Trade secrets are a part of a company's intellectual property. Unlike a patent, a trade secret is not publicly known.





Key Takeaways

Trade secrets are secret practices and processes that give a company a competitive advantage over its competitors.Trade secrets may differ across jurisdictions but have three common traits: not being public, offering some economic benefit, and being actively protected.U.S. trade secrets are protected by the Economics Espionage Act of 1996.


   Understanding a Trade Secret  

Trade secrets may take a variety of forms, such as a proprietary process, instrument, pattern, design, formula, recipe, method, or practice that is not evident to others and may be used as a means to create an enterprise that offers an advantage over competitors or provides value to customers.



Trade secrets are defined differently based on jurisdiction, but all have the following characteristics in common:



They are not public information.Their secrecy provides an economic benefit to their holder.Their secrecy is actively protected.






If a trade secret holder fails to safeguard the secret or if the secret is independently discovered, released, or becomes general knowledge, protection of the secret is removed.



As confidential information (as trade secrets are known in some jurisdictions), trade secrets are the "classified documents" of the business world, just as top-secret documents are closely guarded by government agencies.



Because the cost of developing certain products and processes is much more expensive than competitive intelligence, companies have an incentive to figure out what makes their competitors successful. To protect its trade secrets, a company may require employees privy to the information to sign non-compete or non-disclosure agreements (NDA) upon hire.


   Trade Secret Treatment  

In the United States, trade secrets are defined and protected by the Economic Espionage Act of 1996 (outlined in Title 18, Part I, Chapter 90 of the U.S. Code) and also fall under state jurisdiction. As a result of a 1974 ruling, each state may adopt its own trade secret rules.



Some 47 states and the District of Columbia have adopted some version of the Uniform Trade Secrets Act (USTA).﻿﻿﻿ The most recent legislation addressing trade secrets came in 2016 with the Defend Trade Secrets Act, which gives the federal government cause for action in cases involving the misappropriation of trade secrets.



The federal law defines trade secrets as "all forms and types of" the following information:



FinancialBusinessScientificTechnicalEconomicEngineering



Such information, according to federal law, includes:



PatternsPlansCompilationsProgram devicesFormulasDesignsPrototypesMethodsTechniquesProcessesProceduresProgramsCodes



The above includes, according to federal law, "tangible or intangible, and whether or how stored, compiled, or memorialized physically, electronically, graphically, photographically, or in writing."﻿﻿﻿



The law also provides the condition that the owner has taken reasonable measures to keep such information secret and that "the information derives independent economic value, actual or potential, from not being generally known to, and not being readily ascertainable through proper means by, another person who can obtain economic value from the disclosure or use of the information."﻿﻿﻿



Other jurisdictions may treat trade secrets somewhat differently; some consider them property, while others consider them as an equitable right.


   Real-World Examples  

There are many examples of trade secrets that are tangible and intangible. For example, Google's search algorithm exists as intellectual property in code and is regularly updated to improve and protect its operations.



The secret formula for Coca-Cola, which is locked in a vault, is an example of a trade secret that is a formula or recipe. Since it has not been patented, it has never been revealed.



The New York Times Bestseller list is an example of a process trade secret. While the list does factor in book sales by compiling chain and independent store sales, as well as wholesaler data, the list is not merely sales numbers (books with lower overall sales may make the list while a book with higher sales may not).
What Is a Trade Signal?  

A trade signal is a trigger for action, either to buy or sell a security or other asset, generated by analysis. That analysis can be human generated using technical indicators, or it can be generated using mathematical algorithms based on market action, possibly in combination with other market factors such as economic indicators.





Key Takeaways

Trading signals are triggers to buy or sell a security based on a pre-determined set of criteria.They can also be used to reconstitute a portfolio and shift sector allocations or take new positions.Traders can create trading signals using a variety of criteria, from simple ones, such as earnings reports and volume surge, to more complex signals that are derived using existing signals.


   How a Trade Signal Works  

Trade signals can use a variety of inputs from several disciplines. Typically, technical analysis is a major component, but fundamental analysis, quantitative analysis, and economics may also be inputs, as well as sentiment measures and even signals from other trade signal systems. The goal is to give investors and traders a mechanical method, devoid of emotion, to buy or sell a security or other asset.



Aside from simple buy and sell triggers, trade signals can also be used to modify a portfolio by determining when it might be a good time to buy more of one particular sector, such as technology, and lighten up on another, such as consumer staples. Bond traders, meanwhile, could have signals for adjusting the duration of their portfolios by selling one maturity and buying a different maturity. Finally, it can also help with asset class allocation, such as shifting money among stocks, bonds, and gold.



There is no limit to how complex a trade signal can be. However, traders tend to keep things simple by using only a handful of inputs. For practical purposes, it is far easier to manage a simple signal generator and periodically test it to see what components need adjusting or replacing.



Too many inputs would introduce complexity requiring more time than a trader has to offer. And since markets change over time, often with great speed, complex strategies could be rendered obsolete before testing is even finished.


   Example of a Trade Signal  

Trade signals tend to be associated with quick in and out trading. However, in reality, some signals are less frequent and based on reversion and dip-buying in equities.



Great trading signals of this sort would be to look for periods where price action doesn't line up with the underlying fundamentals. An example would be if the market is selling off due to fear headlines, but the fundamental data indicates good health. Traders may decide to buy the dip if their signal is flashing "good deal."


   Creating a Trade Signal  

There are endless possibilities when coming up with a trade signal, but traders tend to just want to automate their thinking. An example might be, "for a stock with lower than a certain price-to-earnings ratio (P/E ratio), buy when a certain technical formation breaks out to the upside, and prices are above a certain moving average while interest rates are falling."



Here are several of the more common inputs. Traders can combine them as they wish to meet whatever criteria they use to select trades.



Technical pattern breakout or break down. These can include triangles, rectangles, head-and-shoulders, and trendlines.
Moving average cross. Most investors watch 50- and 200-day moving averages but there are many others in common use. The input could be when trading activity crosses above or below the average. Or it could be when two averages cross each other.
Volume surge. Unusually high volume is often a precursor to a new move in the market. In the futures markets, open interest can also be used.
Interest rates. Changes in rates can often suggest changes in stock and commodity markets.
Volatility. There are many ways to measure volatility and, as with other indicators, extreme highs or lows in volatility can trigger market changes.
Cycles. Markets of all types tend to ebb and flow over time, even if they are in a steady trend or in a non-trending condition. One of the more widely known cycles is the seasonal cycle for stocks—sell in May and go away—which could help determine if a strategy is operating in the strong or weak half of the year.
Sentiment extremes. Used as a contrarian indicator, excessive bullishness according to surveys or actual trading activity can suggest market tops. Conversely, excessive bearishness can lead to market bottoms.
Valuation. An excessively high valuation compared to market, sector, or stock-specific measures can lead to sell signals.
What Is a Trade Surplus?  

A trade surplus is an economic measure of a positive balance of trade, where a country's exports exceed its imports. A trade surplus occurs when the result of the following calculation is positive:

Trade Balance = Total Value of Exports - Total Value of Imports


TradeBalance=TotalValueofExports−TotalValueofImports



A trade surplus represents a net inflow of domestic currency from foreign markets. It is the opposite of a trade deficit, which represents a net outflow and occurs when the result of the above calculation is negative. In the United States, trade balances are reported monthly by the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA).





Key Takeaways

A trade surplus is an economic measure of a positive balance of trade, where a country's exports exceed its imports.It is the opposite of a trade deficit.A trade surplus can create employment and economic growth, but may also lead to higher prices and interest rates within an economy as well as a more expensive currency.In the United States, trade balances are reported monthly by the Bureau of Economic Analysis.


   Understanding Trade Surplus  

A trade surplus can create employment and economic growth, but may also lead to higher prices and interest rates within an economy. A country’s trade balance can also influence the value of its currency in the global markets, as it allows a country to have control of the majority of its currency through trade.



In many cases, a trade surplus helps to strengthen a country’s currency relative to other currencies, affecting currency exchange rates; however, this is dependent on the proportion of goods and services of a country in comparison to other countries, as well as other market factors.



When focusing solely on trade effects, a trade surplus means there is high demand for a country’s goods in the global market, which pushes the price of those goods higher and leads to a direct strengthening of the domestic currency.






A trade surplus implies there is high demand from overseas for a country's goods and services, which tends to push their prices up and contribute to a strengthening of the domestic currency.


   Trade Surplus vs. Trade Deficit  

The opposite of a trade surplus is a trade deficit. A trade deficit occurs when a country imports more than it exports.



A trade deficit typically also has the opposite effect on currency exchange rates. When imports exceed exports, a country’s currency demand in terms of international trade is lower. Lower demand for currency makes it less valuable in the international markets.


   Special Considerations  

While in most cases trade balances highly affect currency fluctuations, there are a few factors countries can manage that make trade balances less influential. Countries can manage a portfolio of investments in foreign accounts to control the volatility and movement of the currency. Additionally, countries can also agree on a pegged currency rate that keeps the exchange rate of their currency constant at a fixed rate.



If a currency is not pegged to another currency, its exchange rate is considered floating. Floating exchange rates are highly volatile and subject to daily trading whims within the currency market, which is one of the global financial market’s largest trading arenas.




Is a Trade Surplus Good or Bad?
Generally, selling more than buying is considered a good thing. A trade surplus means the things the country produces are in high demand, which should create lots of jobs and fuel economic growth. However, that doesn't mean the countries with trade deficits are necessarily in a mess. Each economy operates differently and those that historically import more, such as the U.S., often do so for a good reason. Take a look at the countries with the highest trade surpluses and deficits, and you'll soon discover that the world's strongest economies appear across both lists.




Which Countries Have a Trade Surplus?
In 2021, the countries with the highest trade surplus were: China, Germany, Ireland, Russian Federation, and Singapore.




What Increases a Trade Surplus?
A trade surplus rises when a country increasingly sells more to other countries than it buys from other countries. This isn’t always sustainable as growing demand tends to push the value of the currency up, making it more expensive for foreign clients to keep buying.


   The Bottom Line  

Trade surpluses are generally more popular than trade deficits. Protecting domestic industry has become a big theme of late among politicians and led, in some cases, to a series of trade wars and tariffs.



Global tensions and a rise in nationalism have painted a picture of importers being losers. However, that’s not necessarily the case, especially when everyone is on good terms. Trade between countries and importing things when it makes sense financially can be seen as a positive. In fact, some of the strongest economies in the world are running a trade deficit, implying that trade is not a zero-sum game and that importing more than you export isn’t necessarily bad.
What Is a Trade War?  

A trade war happens when one country retaliates against another by raising import tariffs or placing other restrictions on the other country's imports.



Trade wars can commence if one country perceives that a competitor nation has unfair trading practices. Domestic trade unions or industry lobbyists can pressure politicians to make imported goods less attractive to consumers, pushing international policy toward a trade war. Also, trade wars are often a result of a misunderstanding of the widespread benefits of free trade.





Key Takeaways

A trade war occurs when one country retaliates against another by raising import tariffs or placing other restrictions on the other country's imports.Trade wars are a side effect of protectionist policies and are controversial.Advocates say trade wars protect national interests and provide advantages to domestic businesses.Critics of trade wars claim they ultimately hurt local companies, consumers, and the economy.












   Understanding a Trade War  

Trade wars are usually considered a side effect of protectionism. Protectionism refers to government actions and policies that restrict international trade. A country will generally undertake protectionist actions to shield domestic businesses and jobs from foreign competition. Protectionism is also a method used to balance trade deficits. A trade deficit occurs when a country's imports exceed the amounts of its exports. A tariff is a tax or duty imposed on the goods imported into a nation. In a global economy, a trade war can become very damaging to the consumers and businesses of both nations, and the contagion can grow to affect many aspects of both economies.



A trade war that begins in one sector can grow to affect other sectors. Likewise, a trade war that begins between two countries can affect other countries not initially involved in the trade war. As noted above, this import "tit-for-tat" battle can result from a protectionist penchant.



A trade war is distinct from other actions taken to control imports and exports, such as sanctions. Instead, the trade war has detrimental effects on the trading relationship between two countries because its goals are related specifically to trade. Sanctions, for example, may also have philanthropic goals.



In addition to tariffs, protectionist policies can be implemented by placing a cap on import quotas, setting clear product standards, or implementing government subsidies for processes to deter outsourcing.


   History of Trade Wars  

Trade wars are not an invention of modern society. Such battles have been going on for as long as nations have conducted trade with one another. For example, colonial powers fought with each other over the right to trade exclusively with overseas colonies in the 17th century.



The British Empire has a long history of such trade battles. An example can be seen in the opium wars of the 19th century with China. The British had been sending India-produced opium into China for years when the Chinese emperor decreed it to be illegal. Attempts to settle the conflict failed, and the emperor eventually sent troops to confiscate the drugs. However, the might of the British navy prevailed, and China conceded additional entry of foreign trade into the nation.



In 1930, the United States enacted the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act, raising tariffs to protect American farmers from European agricultural products. This act increased the already hefty import duties to almost 40%. In response, several nations retaliated against the United States by imposing their own higher tariffs, and global trade declined worldwide. As America entered the Great Depression, aided greatly by disastrous trade policies, President Roosevelt began to pass several acts to reduce trade barriers, including the Reciprocal Trade Agreements Act.



Beginning in January 2018, former President Trump imposed a series of tariffs on everything from steel and aluminum to solar panels and washing machines. These duties impacted goods from the European Union (EU) and Canada, as well as China and Mexico. Canada retaliated by imposing a series of temporary duties on American steel and other products. The EU also imposed tariffs on American agricultural imports and other products, including Harley Davidson motorcycles.



By May 2019, tariffs on Chinese imports impacted nearly $200 billion of imports. As with all trade wars, China retaliated and imposed stiff duties on American imports. A study by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) shows that U.S. importers of goods have primarily shouldered the cost of the imposed tariffs on Chinese goods. These costs are eventually passed on to the American consumer in the form of higher prices, which is the exact opposite of what the trade war is intended to accomplish.






Although the United States and Russia are not engaged in a trade war, U.S. President Joe Biden announced sanctions against Russia on Feb. 22, 2022, in response to Russia's military aggression against Ukraine. The sanctions include blocking two Russian banks that finance the military, market restrictions on Russian sovereign debt, and targeting individual Russian elites.


   Advantages and Disadvantages of a Trade War  

The advantages and disadvantages of trade wars in particular, and protectionism in general, are the subjects of fierce and ongoing debate. Proponents of protectionism argue that well-crafted policies provide competitive advantages. By blocking or discouraging imports, protective policies throw more business toward the domestic producers, which ultimately creates more American employment. These policies also serve to overcome a trade deficit. Additionally, proponents believe that painful tariffs and trade wars may also be the only effective way to deal with a nation that continues to behave unfairly or unethically in its trading policies.





Pros

Protects domestic companies from unfair competition
Increases demand for domestic goods
Promotes local job growth
Improves trade deficits
Punishes nation with unethical trade policies



Cons

Increases costs and induces inflation
Causes marketplace shortages, reduces choice
Discourages trade
Slows economic growth
Hurts diplomatic relations, cultural exchange






Critics argue that protectionism often hurts the people it is intended to protect long term by choking off markets and slowing economic growth and cultural exchange. Consumers may begin to have less choice in the marketplace. They may even face shortages if there is no ready domestic substitute for the imported goods that tariffs have impacted or eliminated. Having to pay more for raw materials hurts manufacturers' profit margins. As a result, trade wars can lead to price increases—with manufactured goods, in particular, becoming more expensive—sparking inflation in the local economy overall.


   Example of a Trade War  

While running for President in 2016, President Donald Trump expressed his disdain for many current trade agreements, promising to bring manufacturing jobs back to the United States from other nations where they had been outsourced, such as China and India. After his election, he embarked on a protectionist campaign. President Trump also threatened to pull the United States out of the World Trade Organization (WTO), an impartial, international entity that regulates and arbitrates trade among the 164 countries that belong to it.



In early 2018, President Trump stepped up his efforts, particularly against China, threatening a substantial fine over alleged intellectual property (IP) theft and significant tariffs. The Chinese retaliated with a 25% tax on over 100 U.S. products.



Throughout 2018, the two nations continued to threaten each other, releasing lists of proposed tariffs on various goods. Although China responded with tariffs of its own, the American duties did have an impact on the Chinese economy, hurting manufacturers and causing a slowdown. In December, each nation agreed to halt imposing any new taxes. The tariff war cease-fire continued into 2019. In the spring, China and the United States seemed on the verge of a trade agreement.



At the beginning of May, Chinese officials took a new hard line in negotiations, refusing to make changes in their company-subsidizing laws and insisting on the lifting of the current tariffs. Angered by this apparent backtracking, the President doubled down, announcing on May 5, 2019, that he was going to increase tariffs, as of May 10, from 10% to 25% on $200 billion worth of Chinese imports. He may have felt emboldened by the fact that the U.S. trade deficit with China had fallen to its lowest level since 2014.



China halted all imports of farm products by state-owned firms in retaliation. The Asian nation's central bank also weakened the yuan above the seven per dollar reference rate for the first time in over a decade, leading to concerns about a currency war. Perhaps realizing that this was mutually destructive, the United States and China agreed to a trade deal that was signed on Jan. 15, 2020, but the subsequent COVID-19 pandemic threatened a further escalation of trade tensions between the two nations.
What Is a Trademark?  

The term trademark refers to a recognizable insignia, phrase, word, or symbol that denotes a specific product and legally differentiates it from all other products of its kind. A trademark exclusively identifies a product as belonging to a specific company and recognizes the company's ownership of the brand. Trademarks are generally considered a form of intellectual property and may or may not be registered.





Key Takeaways

A trademark is an easily recognizable symbol, phrase, or word that denotes a specific product.It legally differentiates a product or service from all others of its kind and recognizes the source company's ownership of the brand.Trademarks may or may not be registered and are denoted by the ® and ™ symbols respectively.Although trademarks do not expire, the owner must make regular use of it in order to receive the protections associated with them.


   Understanding Trademarks  

Trademarks not only help distinguish products within the legal and business systems—but just as significantly—with consumers. They are used to identify and protect words and design elements that identify the source, owner, or developer of a product or service. They can be corporate logos, slogans, bands, or the brand name of a product. Similar to a trademark, a service mark identifies and distinguishes the source of a service rather than a product, and the term trademark is often used to refer to both trademarks and service marks.



Using a trademark prevents others from using a company or individual's products or services without their permission. They also prohibit any marks that have a likelihood of confusion with an existing one. This means that a business cannot use a symbol or brand name if it looks or sounds similar, or has a similar meaning to one that’s already on the books—especially if the products or services are related. For instance, a soft drink company can't legally use a symbol that looks like that of Coca-Cola and it can't use a name that sounds like Coke.






A trademark does not need to be registered for the owner to prevent others from using it or a confusingly similar mark.



Trademarks in the United States are registered through the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) and are identified with the ® symbol. But trademarks don't have to be registered in order to give the company or individual protection rights. Unregistered trademarks can be recognized with the ™ symbol. By using this symbol, the trademark user indicates they are using common law to protect their interests.



The laws governing trademarks never expire. This means the holder has the right to the trademark for the life of the product or service. But there are certain exceptions. The user is required to make continuous, lawful use of the trademark in order to take advantage of trademark laws. So a company or individual must regularly manufacture, produce, market, and sell a product with a particular trademark in order for the trademark law to be enforceable. This can be done every five years by filing a section 8 declaration through the USPTO. Failure to file this can result in the loss of registration.


   Special Considerations  

Trademarks can be bought and sold. Trademarks also can be licensed to other companies for an agreed-upon time or under certain conditions, which can result in crossover brands. Take the relationship LEGO has with certain movie franchises, for example. The private company licenses many famous sub-brands such as Star Wars and DC Comics to produce LEGO versions of popular products.



As mentioned above, trademarks are also used as an effective way to market brand names. In fact, the power of branding in business is critical and can fill volumes, and the use of brands in marketing is legendary.



Some brands, like Kleenex, are so prominent and have such successful brand identities that they have almost replaced the noun that was the original word for the item or service, like asking for a Kleenex instead of a tissue. Kimberly Clark (KMB) owns the Kleenex trademark and launched the brand in 1924 as a disposable tissue for removing cosmetics. In 1930, the company launched the brand again—this time as a substitute for handkerchiefs. Since then, Kleenex has been the number-one selling facial tissue in the world.



Similarly, we generally don't ask for a "self-adhesive bandage with sterile cotton liner" but are more apt to ask for a band-aid. Consumer goods and pharma giant Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) began making sterile gauze dressings as early as 1887. But it wasn't until 1920 that the company launched its BAND-AID® Brand adhesive bandage. A cotton buyer for Johnson & Johnson, Earle Dickson, invented the band-aid:



Dickson's wife was prone to cutting her fingers in the kitchen. So, Dickson wanted a bandage that his wife could apply easily. He combined two of the company’s early products (adhesive tape and gauze) by placing a strip of gauze down the middle of a long piece of surgical tape that he covered with fabric to keep the adhesive from sticking. His wife could then bandage her wounds with a piece cut from the tape and gauze pad. Dickson demonstrated the invention to his boss, who told company president James Wood Johnson, and a new product was born.


   Trademark vs. Patent vs. Copyright  

Trademarks are distinctly different from patents and copyrights. A patent grants the design, process, and invention rights to a piece of property to its inventor. In order to be registered, the inventor must make full disclosure of the invention—the design and the process—itself through the USPTO. This gives the inventor full protection over the product or service in question for a certain period of time—usually 20 years.



Anyone can make use of the invention by producing, marketing, and selling it after the patent expires. This is common in the pharmaceutical industry. A drug company that patents a drug has exclusive rights over it for a certain period of time before other companies can market and sell generic brands to the public.



Copyrights, on the other hand, give protection to the owners of intellectual property to legally copy it. Copyright owners and those who have the authority can exclusively reproduce the associated work for monetary gain for a specific period of time—usually until 70 years after their death. Software, art, film, music, and designs are just some of the examples of work that are covered by copyrights. Brand names, slogans, and logos, however, are not covered. In order to get a copyright and prevent copyright infringement, the filer must make an application with the U.S. Copyright Office.
The Definition of a Trader  

A trader is an individual who engages in the buying and selling of assets in any financial market, either for themself or on behalf of another person or institution. The main difference between a trader and an investor is the duration for which the person holds the asset. Investors tend to have a longer-term time horizon, while traders tend to hold assets for much shorter periods to capitalize on short-term trends.





Key Takeaways

Traders are individuals who engage in the short-term buying and selling of a financial asset for themselves or an institution such as a bank, brokerage firm, or hedge fund.Traders use a variety of strategies to generate profits, including scalping, day trading, and swing trading.Traders can be contrasted with investors, who seek long-term capital gains rather than short-term profits.


   The Role of a Trader  

The main objective of a trader is to generate profits by buying at a low price and selling at a higher price. What they buy and sell are financial assets that include stocks, bonds, currencies, commodities, and derivatives. The profit generation is achieved through various approaches such as fundamental, technical and quantitative analyses, which aid in identifying market trends and opportunities.



Traders also manage risks associated with their profession, including market risk, credit risk, and liquidity risk. They may use hedging strategies to mitigate these risks.






Traders play a critical role in providing liquidity to financial markets. Their activities are essential for the smooth functioning of financial markets and the allocation of capital to productive uses.


   Skill Requirements of Traders  

Traders need to possess several quantitative and qualitative skills to be successful. The skills are a combination of technical, analytical, and behavioral qualities. It is a prerequisite for traders to be experts of the financial markets.



Traders need to have a deep understanding of the asset classes, market dynamics, and various strategies in these markets. Traders have to be analytical. They need to figure out how to process large amounts of data quickly and correctly to make informed decisions about the financial markets in which they trade. Numeracy skills are also important. Traders have to be able to calculate complex financial problems.



Traders also need to be masters of risk management. They must constantly monitor their current and potential positions to ensure that the risks they take are optimal. Traders must effectively use their stop-loss and limit orders to maintain profitability and margins.



Communication is also a key skill for a trader. Their colleagues, clients, bosses, and other stakeholders need to quickly and effectively understand what their trader is saying so that they can make informed decisions. Finally, traders should have high emotional intelligence. Trading is an intense profession, and traders need to effectively manage their emotions in a highly stressful environment.


   Trading Strategies  

Traders employ many strategies to produce and maintain profitability. Some of these strategies include scalping, day trading, swing trading, event trading, and position trading. It should be noted that no trading strategy is foolproof; there are advantages and disadvantages to any trading strategy. Traders also consider risks when employing their strategies.


  Scalping  

Scalping entails the buying and selling of financial instruments such as stocks, futures, currencies, and commodities in quick succession, with the goal of producing small gains on the positions. Scalpers attempt to profit from short-term price movements. The time frame that scalp traders hold positions ranges from seconds to minutes. The risk in scalping lies in the quick generation of successive losses rather than gains.


  Day Trading  

The strategy of day trading involves taking positions in financial assets such as stocks, futures, currencies, and commodities within the same trading day. Day traders tend to hold an abundance of trades over minutes and hours, as they maneuver their transactions through changing market conditions. They tend to amplify their trades through leveraged positions. The use of leverage poses an additional risk for day traders.


  Swing Trading  

Swing trading involves profiting from short- to medium-term price movements in various financial instruments such as stocks, futures, currencies, or commodities. Unlike scalpers and day traders, swing traders hold their positions for longer time periods. This can be for several days, weeks, or even months and is dependent on the asset, the trend, and the other existing positions of the swing trader.



Generally, swing trading is considered to be less risky than scalping or day trading because swing traders have more time to make decisions. Nonetheless, there are risks involved. News or events can affect the price trends of the swing trader’s portfolio.


  Event Trading  

The strategy of event trading entails profiting from short-term price movements triggered from a specific economic or financial event such as mergers or acquisitions, earnings releases, regulatory decisions, inflation data, labor market data, or gross domestic product (GDP) data.



Event traders need to execute their positions quickly, seconds before the data release, to profit from the position. Also, event traders tend to use leverage to amplify their profits. The use of leverage comes with additional risks to the strategy.


  Position Trading  

A position trader or a position trading firm is an individual or entity that buys financial assets for the long term. These professionals hold positions for weeks, months, or even years. The time frame of holding the position is highly dependent on the position trader’s investment thesis as well as the economic and financial market outlook.






With the longer-term view, position trading is considered to be less risky than the other short-term trading strategies, as these traders have more time to endure the short-term price fluctuations.


   Places Where Traders Perform Their Duties  

Traders tend to work in a variety of places. Those traders who work for themselves may have a home office or may rent one. If that isn’t the case, traders will have roles in investment banks, brokerage firms, proprietary trading firms, asset management firms, hedge funds, or exchanges. Traders may work in the physical office or remotely, depending on the nature of the trading activity and the firm’s policies.


   Trader Operations: Institution vs. Own Account  

Many large financial institutions have trading rooms where traders are employees who buy and sell a wide range of products on behalf of the company. Each trader is given a limit as to how large of a position they can take, the position’s maximum maturity, and how much of a mark-to-market loss they can have before a position must be closed out. The company has the underlying risk and keeps most of the profit; the trader receives a salary and bonuses.



On the other hand. most people who trade on their own account work from home or in a small office, and they often use a discount broker and electronic trading platforms. Their limits are dependent on their own cash and credit, but they will often keep all profits.


   Discount Brokers: An Important Resource for Traders  

Discount brokerage firms charge significantly lower commissions per transaction but provide little or no financial advice. Individuals can’t trade directly on a stock or commodity exchange on their own account, so using a discount broker is a cost-effective way to gain access to the markets.






Many discount brokers offer margin accounts, which let traders borrow money from the broker to buy assets. This increases the size of the positions they can take but also increases the potential loss.



Foreign exchange trading platforms match currency buyers and sellers in the spot, forward, and options markets. They sharply increase the amount of price information available to individual traders, thus narrowing price spreads and reducing commissions.


   The Type of Information That Traders Use  

Traders use a variety of techniques to source information. This is essential to make informed decisions and be profitable in their activities. The types of information that traders access include fundamental, technical, or market timing, noise, and sentiment. With this information, traders can even develop a contrarian view or find arbitrage opportunities.


  Fundamental Information  

Fundamental information, or fundamentals, refers to data that provide insights into the underlying intrinsic value of the financial asset, such as a stock, bond, future, currency, or commodity.






Fundamentals are generally gleaned from economic, industry-specific, and financial data and include economic data, industry trends, company news and events, and financial statements.


  Technical and Market-Timing Information  

When using technical and market-timing information, traders analyze past and current market data to spot patterns and trends. This is to anticipate future price movements in assets such as stocks, bonds, futures, currencies, or commodities.



Traders use technical analysis and other market-timing information to identify buying and selling opportunities. They use charting techniques and momentum indicators such as moving averages and oscillators to accomplish this. Examples of market-timing information include economic and financial releases, as well as market sentiment indicators.


  Noise Trading  

Noise trading involves making decisions on factors that seem to be helpful but would usually generate profits equivalent to a random choice. Some of these factors can include rumors, gossip, or emotions. Noise can create market imbalances that rational traders can profit from. Also, noise traders are often associated with retail or inexperienced investors who lack the necessary tools to profit from trading.


  Sentiment  

Sentiment refers to the overall view of financial market participants. This can be bullish, neutral, or bearish. These views can be toward the financial markets or various assets such as stocks, currencies, or commodities. Market sentiment can be attributed to factors such as economic and financial data, geopolitical events, or company news.



Sentiment indicators are based on data comprising trading volume, price movements, and news coverage of financial instruments or markets. Sentiment is also developed through the quantification of surveys or polls. The data helps to gauge the level of optimism or pessimism in the financial markets.


  Contrarian Trading  

Contrarian trading involves analyzing market conditions and taking an opposing side of the prevailing consensus view of the financial markets. This is based on the premise that market participants often overreact to events, leading to significant price movements in financial markets.



Contrarian traders identify overbought or oversold conditions in conjunction with trend reversals. High conviction in the trades are required, as the contrarian view by its very definition is often unpopular.






Successful contrarian traders employ a rigorous analytical process to identify potential opportunities and carefully manage risks to avoid significant losses.


  Arbitrage  

Arbitrage refers to exploiting price discrepancies between two or more instruments or markets. The assumption calls for taking advantage of mispricing in different markets, buying an asset in one market at a lower price and selling the same asset in another market at a higher price, producing a profit.



These opportunities can occur in stocks, bonds, currencies, and commodities over different exchanges or geographical regions. Arbitrage occurs because of market inefficiencies or temporary imbalances in supply and demand.


   Becoming a Trader  

Earning a role as a trader in the financial markets can involve a significant amount of preparation, including education, training, and licensing. Most entry-level trading jobs require at least a bachelor's degree, with employers often seeking graduates who have majored in business, economics, and accounting. A master's in business administration (MBA) may be an important qualification for higher-level positions at trading firms.



Companies that hire traders generally offer employee training programs that focus on the business and the particular types of assets sold by the firm. Brokers and investment bankers working with registered firms must obtain a license from the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA), which involves passing a series of examinations to verify their knowledge of the financial markets. Additional professional certifications such as the Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA) designation and the Chartered Market Technician (CMT) designation may expand a trader's opportunities and chances for career advancement.


   Salary and Employment Outlook  

Many people may be interested in working as a trader because of the possibility of earning a substantial paycheck. For traders working on their own behalf, generating income will depend on implementing a successful trading strategy and effectively managing risk. Meanwhile, traders working for financial firms may earn a base salary with the potential for a substantial bonus based on their performance.



According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), as of May 2021, the median annual wage came to $62,910 for securities, commodities, and financial services sales agents—a broader category that includes many traders. Those working specifically in securities, commodity contracts, and other financial investments and related activities earn a median annual wage of $98,030.



If that level of income seems attractive, there is good news about the employment outlook for the industry, as predictions call for a healthy availability of jobs over the coming years. The BLS estimates that employment for securities, commodities, and financial services sales agents will grow 10% from 2021 to 2031, exceeding the average for all occupations. While competition for these positions may be intense given the necessary skills involved, the BLS estimates that 46,600 job openings per year in this area over the decade.




Why is trading important in finance?
There are several reasons why trading is important in finance. Trading in financial instruments produces price discovery, generates liquidity, brings out capital flows, and aids in price efficiency. Through trading, market participants converge toward the fair value of financial assets. Also, with trading, liquidity is generated, enabling the quick transfer of stocks, bonds, futures, commodities, and currencies.




What is the difference between trading and investing?
There are two major approaches to the financial markets: trading and investing. While they share some similarities, trading and investing differ in terms of time horizon, risk tolerance, and investment style, as well as approach. Trading is short-term in nature, while investing is long-term in nature. With investing, a more passive approach is taken. Investors will adjust their portfolios occasionally to reflect their long-term goals. Trading is much more active, with the frequent buying and selling of securities.




What are the asset types for traders?
Stocks, bonds, currencies or foreign exchange, options, futures, commodities, cryptocurrencies, and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) are the most common type of assets that are traded. The asset class is dependent on the traders’ preference, expertise, and the market in which they operate. Also, traders can choose to specialize in one asset class or more, depending on their goals and skills.




What are the benefits of being a trader?
There are several potential benefits of being a trader. Traders have a high propensity to generate earnings. Traders tend to work in a fast-paced and exciting environment. This would appeal to people who like being in a highly dynamic space. Traders can have the flexibility to work remotely and work nonstandard hours. Traders gain significant exposure to the financial markets, as they have to actively and closely monitor them along with the factors that drive the respective markets.




What are the limitations of being a trader?
In any role, there are advantages and disadvantages. For traders, there are a handful of limitations. Trading can be a high-stress and competitive profession, which isn’t suitable for everyone. There is also a risk of financial loss. Moreover, traders work long hours. When markets are in a downturn, there is a high potential for traders to lose their jobs. To be a successful trader, people often need to attain specialized education, training, and experience, which can be time-consuming and expensive.


   The Bottom Line  

Trading is a highly skilled profession that provides price discovery and liquidity in a multitude of financial markets, including stocks, bonds, currencies, commodities, or derivatives. Traders can either be entrepreneurs or work for investment banks, hedge funds, or proprietary trading firms. Also, they use various strategies and tools to look for opportunities as well as to exploit market inefficiencies or mispricing.



To gain an edge, traders analyze market data and news, as well as economic and financial indicators. Also, traders may use technical analysis, quantitative models, or algorithms to execute their orders. Traders need to have strong analytical, quantitative, and problem-solving skills. Beyond that, they need to be able to manage risks and work under pressure. Successful traders can make huge sums of money, but trading is also associated with sizable risk and potential losses.
What Is a Trading Account?  

A trading account can be any investment account containing securities, cash or other holdings. Most commonly, trading account refers to a day trader’s primary account. These investors tend to buy and sell assets frequently, often within the same trading session, and their accounts are subject to special regulation as a result. The assets held in a trading account are separated from others that may be part of a long-term buy and hold strategy.


   Basics of Trading Account  

A trading account can hold securities, cash and other investment vehicles just like any other brokerage account. The term can describe a wide range of accounts, including tax-deferred retirement accounts. In general, however, a trading account is distinguished from other investment accounts by the level of activity, purpose of that activity and the risk it involves. The activity in a trading account typically constitutes day trading. The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) defines a day trade as the purchase and sale of a security within the same day in a margin account. FINRA defines pattern day traders as investors who satisfy the following two criteria:



Traders who make at least four day trades (either buying and selling a stock or selling a stock sort and closing that short position within the same day) over a five-day week.
Traders whose day-trading activity constitutes more than 6 percent of their total activity during that same week.



Brokerage firms can also identify clients as pattern day traders based on previous business or another reasonable conclusion. These firms will allow clients to open cash or margin accounts, but day traders typically choose margin for the trading accounts. FINRA enforces special margin requirements for investors it considers to be pattern day traders.



Opening a trading account requires certain minimum personal information, including social security number and contact details. Your brokerage firm may have other requirements depending on the jurisdiction and its business details.


   FINRA Margin Requirements for Trading Accounts  

Maintenance requirements for pattern day trading accounts are considerably higher than those of non-pattern trading. The base requirements of all margin investors are outlined by the Federal Reserve Board’s Regulation T. FINRA includes additional maintenance requirements for day traders in Rule 4210. Day traders must maintain a base equity level of $25,000 or 25 percent of securities values, whichever is higher. The trader is permitted a purchasing power of up to four times any excess over that minimum requirement. Equity held in non-trading accounts is not eligible for this calculation. A trader who fails to meet these requirements will receive a margin call from their broker and trading will be restricted if the call is not covered within five days.





Key Takeaways

A trading account is an investment account. For the most part, however, it refers to an account used to trade securities. Trading accounts require personal identification information and have minimum margin requirements set by FINRA.
What Is a Trading Book?  

A trading book is the portfolio of financial instruments held by a brokerage or bank. Financial instruments in a trading book are purchased or sold for several reasons. For example, they might be bought or sold to facilitate trading actions for customers or to profit from trading spreads between the bid and ask prices, or to hedge against different forms of risk. Trading books can range in size from hundreds of thousands of dollars to tens of billions depending on the size of the institution.


   Basics of a Trading Book  

Most institutions employ sophisticated risk metrics to manage and mitigate risk in their trading books. Trading books function as a form of accounting ledger by tracking the securities held by the institution that are regularly bought and sold. Additionally, trading history information is tracked within the trading book by creating a simple way to review the institution's previous activities of associated securities. This differs from a banking book as securities in a trading book are not intended to be held until maturity while the securities in the banking book are going to be held long-term.



Securities held in a trading book must be eligible for active trading.



Trading books are subject to gains and losses as prices of the included securities change. Since these securities are held by the financial institution, and not by individual investors, these gains and losses impact the financial fitness of the institution directly.





Key Takeaways

Trading books are a form of accounting ledger that contains records of all tradeable financial assets of a bank.Trading books are subject to gains and losses that affect the financial institution directly.Losses in a bank's trading book can have a cascading effect on the global economy, such as those that occurred during the 2008 financial crisis.


   Impact of Trading Book Losses  

The trading book can be a source of massive losses within a financial institution. Losses arise due to the extremely high degrees of leverage employed by an institution to build the trading book. Another source of trading book losses is disproportionate and highly concentrated wagers on specific securities or market sectors by errant or rogue traders.



Trading book losses can have a cascading, global effect when they hit numerous financial institutions at the same time, such as during the Long-Term Capital Management, LTCM, Russian debt crisis of 1998, and the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy in 2008. The global credit crunch and financial crisis of 2008 was significantly attributable to the hundreds of billions of losses sustained by global investment banks in the mortgage-backed securities portfolios held within their trading books. During that crisis, Value at Risk (VaR) models were used to quantify trading risks in trading books. Banks transferred their risk from the banking book to trading books because VaR values are low.



Attempts to disguise mortgage-backed security trading book losses during the financial crisis ultimately resulted in criminal charges being brought against a former vice president of Credit Suisse Group.﻿﻿ In 2014, Citigroup Inc. purchased the commodity trading books held by Credit Suisse. Credit Suisse participated in the sale in response to regulatory pressure and their intent to lower their involvement in commodities investing.﻿﻿
What Is a Trading Desk?  

A trading desk is a physical location where transactions for buying and selling securities occur. Depending on the type of financial institution, the trading desk may be filled by traders trading for their own proprietary account, brokers who act as agents matching buyers and sellers, or some mixture of both.



Trading desks are found in most financial firms that are involved in facilitating trade executions in markets such as equities, fixed income securities, futures, commodities, and currencies. These facilities are crucial to providing market liquidity.



A trading desk may also be known as a dealing desk.





Key Takeaways

A trading desk is a designated space within a financial firm where trading activity takes place.Trading desks are occupied by professionals, ranging from proprietary traders to agency-only brokers.Trading desks are typically segmented by asset class or security types, such as those specializing in equities, fixed income, forex, commodities, and/or derivatives.


   Understanding Trading Desks  

Traders operating in the financial markets usually converge in a room known as the trading floor or trading room. The trading floor is made up of desks that share a large open space. Each desk, formally called a trading desk, specializes in a security type or market segment. Trading desks are where buying and selling of securities occur within a financial institution.



Before the 1970s, many banks split their capital markets business into many different departments across several regions. These institutions began consolidating these departments in the 1970s following the launch of the NASDAQ, which required all investment firms to have equity trading desks. Today, many asset managers outsource their trading desks to these larger institutions.



Trading desks are manned by licensed traders who specialize in a given investment type, such as equities or commodities. These traders primarily use electronic trading systems and market makers to identify the best prices for their clients.



The personnel on trading desks receive clients' orders from the sales desk, which is in charge of suggesting trading ideas to institutional and high-net-worth investors. In addition to trading activities, trading desks also help clients with structuring financial products, watching for opportunities, or supporting agreements between companies and investors.


   How Trading Desks Work  

Trading desks generate an income by charging a commission on trades they transact. For example, a hedge fund may deal through an equity trading desk at an investment bank and pay a modest fee for each trade. In some cases, brokers may operate their own trading desk by being the counterparty for their client’s trades. These trades may never reach the interbank market and may stay within the confines of the broker’s own liquidity pool.



There are many different types of trading desks, depending on the security being traded. Oftentimes, these desks are separated and may be located at certain central exchanges.


   Types of Trading Desks  

Some common trading desks include:



Equity trading desks handle everything from equity trading to exotic options trading.
Fixed-income trading desks handle government bonds, corporate bonds, and other bonds and bond-like instruments that pay a yield.
Foreign exchange trading desks facilitate trading in currency pairs by acting as market makers. They can also engage in proprietary trading activities.
Commodity trading desks are focused on agricultural products, metals, and other commodities, such as crude oil, gold, and coffee.
Derivatives trading desks specialize in derivatives, such as options, futures, forwards, and swaps.



Each of these sectors can be further subdivided. For instance, fixed income is a very broad category and can deal with anything from ultra-safe U.S. Treasuries to ultra-risky, low-grade company bonds—also known as junk bonds. Larger investment banks may subdivide their trading desks to specialize in narrower categories within these main sectors.



Many brokers also offer trading desks for their clients, especially in the foreign exchange market and equity day trading market. With the ability to instantly execute trades, these brokers set themselves apart from other brokers acting as intermediaries. Most large financial institutions have their own trading desks in place to assist their internal teams and external clients in placing orders.
What Is a Trading Halt?  

A trading halt is a temporary suspension of trading for a particular security or securities at one exchange or across numerous exchanges. Trading can be halted in anticipation of a news announcement, to correct an order imbalance, as a result of a technical glitch, due to regulatory concerns or because the price of the security or an index has moved rapidly enough to trigger a halt based on exchange rules. When a trading halt is in effect, open orders may be canceled and options still may be exercised.



Trading halts are different from a trading suspension ordered by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Under U.S. securities law, the SEC may suspend public trading in any stock for up to 10 days to protect investors and the public interest.





Key Takeaways

A trading halt is a brief stoppage in trading for a particular security or securities at one exchange or across numerous exchanges.Trading halts are typically applied ahead of a news announcement, to correct an order imbalance, or as a result of a large and abrupt change in the share price.Market-wide halts may also be triggered by severe intraday declines in the S&P 500 index under what are called circuit breaker rules.


   How a Trading Halt Works  

A trading halt can be regulatory or non-regulatory. Regulatory halts are those applied when there is doubt the security continues to meet listing standards to give market participants time to assess important news, as in the event of a U.S. Food and Drug Administration decision on a new drug application, for example.



A trading halt ensures wide access to the news likely to move the price and prevents those who receive it first from profiting from others late to the information. Other material developments that may warrant a regulatory trading halt include corporate acquisitions and restructurings, regulatory or legal decisions or changes in management.



A regulatory trading halt in a security by its primary U.S. exchange is honored by other U.S. exchanges.



A non-regulatory trading halt can occur on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) (but not the Nasdaq) to correct a large imbalance between buy and sell orders. Such trading halts typically last no more than a few minutes until order balance is restored, and the trading resumes.



Companies will often wait until the market closes to release sensitive information to the public, to give investors time to evaluate the information and determine whether it is significant. This practice, however, can lead to a large imbalance between buy orders and sell orders in the lead-up to the market opening. In such an instance, an exchange may decide to institute an opening delay, or a trading halt, immediately at the market opening. These delays are usually in effect for no more than a few minutes while the balance between buy orders and sell orders is restored.



A federal U.S. securities law also grants the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) the power to impose a suspension of trading in any publicly traded stock for up to 10 days. The SEC will use this power if it believes that the investing public is put a risk by continued trading of the stock. Typically, it will exercise this power when a publicly traded company has failed to file periodic reports like quarterly or annual financial statements.


   Circuit Breaker Trading Halts  

U.S. securities exchanges have standing rules for market-wide trading halts in instances were dramatic price declines threaten market liquidity. Cumulative declines of 7% and 13% from the prior's day closing level in the &P 500 index trigger a 15 minute market-wide trading halt if they occur before 3:25 p.m. ET. A 20% decline in the S&P 500 from the prior's day close halts the stock market for the remainder of the trading day no matter when it happens.



Circuit breakers can also apply to trading in any stock under U.S. trading rules. For stocks priced above $3 and included in the S&P 500 or the Russell 1000 indices, as well as certain exchange-traded products like ETFs, trading is halted for five minutes after sudden moves of more than 5% and lasting more than 15 seconds—up or down—from the average price over the prior 5 minutes. For other stocks priced above $3 the sudden price move required for a trading halt is 10%, while those priced between $0.75 and $3 are halted after a sudden gain or loss of 20% or more.
What Is a Trading House?  

A trading house is a business that specializes in facilitating transactions between a home country and foreign countries. A trading house is an exporter, importer and also a trader that purchases and sells products for other businesses. Trading houses provide a service for businesses that want international trade experts to receive or deliver goods or services.



A trading house may also refer to a firm that buys and sells both commodity futures and physical commodities on behalf of customers and for their own accounts. Prominent commodity trading houses include Cargill, Vitol and Glencore.





Key Takeaways

Trading houses are intermediaries used by manufacturers to facilitate trade in a foreign location.Trading houses offer a variety of services, from serving as agents for the manufacturer in the foreign market to easing the import-export process through connections with local liaisons.Although a retailer has to pay a marked-up price for products imported or sold through a trading house, it can avoid the hassles of importing and benefit from trading houses' expertise in foreign markets, discounted rates, and currency exchange complications.


   Understanding Trading Houses  

A trading house serves as an intermediary. It might purchase t-shirts wholesale from China, then sell them to a retailer in the United States. The U.S. retailer would still receive wholesale pricing, but the price would be slightly higher than if the retailer purchased directly from the Chinese company. The trading house must mark up the price of the goods it sells to cover its costs and earn a profit, however, the t-shirt retailer avoids the hassles of importing. The retailer also may be able to simplify its operations by dealing with one or two trading houses to get its inventory instead of dealing directly with numerous wholesalers.



Small businesses that use a trading house can benefit from its expertise and insight into international markets they operate in, as well as get access to vendor financing through direct loans and trade credits.


   Advantages of Trading Houses  
  Economies of Scale  

A trading house typically has a large portfolio of clients that provide economies of scale benefits. For example, a large trading house can use its significant buying power to receive discounts from manufacturers and suppliers. A trading house can also reduce transportation costs if it ships to customers in large quantities.


  International Foothold  

Trading houses have an extensive network of contacts in international markets that help them secure favorable deals and find new customers. They may also have staff working in foreign offices to work with customs officials and manage legal issues to ensure the smooth operation of the business.


  Currency Management  

Because a trading house is continually importing and exporting products, they have expertise in managing currency risk. Trading houses use risk management techniques, such as hedging, to avoid getting exposed to adverse currency fluctuations. For example, a trading house that has a future payment in euros may use a currency forward contract to lock in the current EUR/USD exchange rate.


   Example of Trading Houses  

Japan is scarce in resources, whether it is food or natural resources, and imports most of them through five trading houses known as sōgō shōsha. The trading houses were developed in Japan during the Meiji Restoration period to bolster its economy during a period of rebuilding. They also helped prop up the country's economy after its defeat and devastation in the Second World War. The role of sōgō shōshas is not confined to a specific sector of Japan's economy. They import goods and services across multiple industries vital to the nation's economy, from automobiles to infrastructure to clothing. The five biggest sōgō shōshas are Mitsubishi Corp, Mitsui & Co. Ltd., Sumitomo Corp., Itochu Corp. and Marubeni Corp.
What Is a Trading Platform?  

A trading platform is a software system used to trade securities. It allows investors to open, close, and manage market positions online through a financial intermediary, such as an online broker.



Online trading platforms are frequently offered by brokers either for free or at a discount in exchange for maintaining a funded account and/or making a specified number of trades per month. The best trading platforms offer a mix of robust features and low fees.





Key Takeaways

Trading platforms are software systems used to execute and manage market positions.Trading platforms can offer an easy-to-use interface with basic order entry screens for beginning investors.They can also offer more sophisticated tools such as real-time streaming quotes, advanced charting tools, live news feeds, educational resources, and access to proprietary research.Traders and investors should consider fees and features when comparing trading platforms.Interactive Brokers is rated highly as a trading platform/online broker for advanced traders.


   Understanding Trading Platforms  

A trading platform is a software system offered to investors and traders by certain financial institutions, such as brokerages and banks. Essentially, trading platforms enable investors and traders to place trades and monitor their accounts.



Often, trading platforms include other features that help investors make their investment decisions. These features can include real-time quotes, interactive charts, and a range of charting tools, streaming news feeds, and premium research. Platforms also may be tailored to specific markets, such as stocks, currencies, options, or futures markets.



There are two types of trading platforms: commercial platforms and proprietary platforms. Commercial platforms are designed for day traders and retail investors. They are characterized by ease of use and an assortment of helpful features, such as real-time quotes, international news feeds, live, interactive charts, educational content, and research tools.



On the other hand, proprietary platforms are customized platforms developed by large brokerages and other financial institutions for their own trading activities. These are not available to the public.






In 2020, Charles Schwab officially acquired TD Ameritrade for about $22 billion. The acquisition resulted in client assets valued at over $6 trillion and approximately 28 million brokerage accounts.


   Special Considerations  
  Features  

When choosing a trading platform, traders and investors should consider whether the features offered meet their trading needs. Day traders and other short-term traders may require features such as Level 2 quotes and access to market depth information such as price levels, order size, and volume to assist them in timing their orders.



They may need technical analysis tools such as live charts with a range of technical indicators. Options traders may need tools that are specifically designed to help them research, analyze, and test their trading strategies.


  Fees  

Fees are also important to consider when choosing a trading platform. For example, traders who employ scalping as a trading strategy will gravitate towards platforms with low fees. In general, lower fees are always preferable but there may be trade-offs to consider. For example, low fees may not be advantageous if they translate to fewer or less powerful features.


  Provider  

Some trading platforms aren't connected to a specific intermediary or broker. Conversely, other trading platforms are only available when you work with a particular intermediary or broker. As a result, investors should consider carefully the reputation of the intermediary or broker before committing to a specific trading platform to execute trades and manage their accounts. Be sure a provider stands solidly behind all that a platform offers.


  Requirements  

Finally, trading platforms may have specific requirements that must be met before you can open an account and/or trade. For example, day trading platforms may require that traders have at least $25,000 in equity in their accounts and be approved for margin trading. Options platforms may require that traders be approved to trade various types of options before they can use the trading platform.


   Popular Trading Platforms  

There are hundreds—if not thousands—of different trading platforms, including these four popular options:



Interactive Brokers: Interactive Brokers is the most popular trading platform for professionals, with low fees and access to markets around the world.
TradeStation: TradeStation is a popular trading platform for algorithmic traders who prefer to execute trading strategies using automated scripts developed with EasyLanguage.
TD Ameritrade: TD Ameritrade is a popular broker for both traders and investors, especially following its acquisition of thinkorswim.
Robinhood: Robinhood is a commission-free trading platform targeting millennials. It started off as a mobile app and now has a web interface as well. The platform makes money from several sources, from interest on cash in its accounts to selling order flow to large brokerages.



The most popular platform for many foreign exchange (forex) market participants is MetaTrader, which is a trading platform that interfaces with many different brokers. Its MQL scripting language has become a popular tool for those looking to automate their trading in currencies.




What's a Trading Platform?
Essentially, a trading platform is a software system typically offered through a brokerage or other financial institution that lets you trade online, on your own. A trading platform gives investors an online interface through which they can access various markets, place trades, monitor positions, and manage their accounts.Trading platforms can offer a number of other features, as well. Broadly speaking, these include real-time quotes, live business and financial news feeds, instant access to a wealth of streaming and historical financial data, technical analysis tools, investment research, and educational resources.




Is There a Good Trading Platform for Beginning Traders?
E*Trade and TD Ameritrade are choices that beginners may want to look into. TD Ameritrade has excellent educational resources that can help novice traders understand the markets and become more comfortable with trading before actually placing trades. E*Trade's user-friendly interface can eliminate the frustrations a beginner might have trying to navigate a trading platform.




What Is a Day Trader?
A day trader is a trader who makes multiple trades in a single day, rarely (if ever) holding a position overnight. Day traders try to take advantage of intraday price movements and market inefficiencies to make money. They tend to use technical analysis to help them time their market entries and exits. Day trading requires focus, dedication, and discipline.
What Is a Trading Strategy?  

A trading strategy is a systematic methodology used for buying and selling in the securities markets. A trading strategy is based on predefined rules and criteria used when making trading decisions.



A trading strategy may be simple or complex, and involve considerations such as investment style (e.g., value vs. growth), market cap, technical indicators, fundamental analysis, industry sector, level of portfolio diversification, time horizon or holding period, risk tolerance, leverage, tax considerations, and so on. The key is that a trading strategy be set using objective data and analysis and is adhered to diligently. At the same time, a trading strategy should be periodically re-evaluated and tweaked as market conditions or individual goals change.





Key Takeaways

A trading strategy can be likened to a trading plan that takes into account various factors and requirements for an investor.A trading strategy typically consists of three stages: planning, placing trades, and executing trades.At each stage of the process, metrics relating to the strategy are measured and changed based on the change in markets.Most trading strategies are based on either technicals or fundamentals, using quantifiable information that can be backtested to determine accuracy. 


   Understanding Trading Strategies  

A trading strategy includes a well-considered investing and trading plan that specifies investing objectives, risk tolerance, time horizon, and tax implications. Ideas and best practices need to be researched and adopted then adhered to. Planning for trading includes developing methods that include buying or selling stocks, bonds, ETFs, or other investments and may extend to more complex trades such as options or futures.



Placing trades means working with a broker or broker-dealer and identifying and managing trading costs including spreads, commissions, and fees. Once executed, trading positions are monitored and managed, including adjusting or closing them as needed. Risk and return are measured as well as portfolio impacts of trades and tax implications.






The longer-term tax results of trading are a major factor and may encompass capital gains or tax-loss harvesting strategies to offset gains with losses.


   Developing a Trading Strategy  

There are many types of trading strategies, but they are based largely on either technicals or fundamentals. The common thread is that both rely on quantifiable information that can be backtested for accuracy. Technical trading strategies rely on technical indicators to generate trading signals. Technical traders believe all information about a given security is contained in its price and that it moves in trends. For example, a simple trading strategy may be a moving average crossover whereby a short-term moving average crosses above or below a long-term moving average.



Fundamental trading strategies take fundamental factors into account. For instance, an investor may have a set of screening criteria to generate a list of opportunities. These criteria are developed by analyzing factors such as revenue growth and profitability.



There is a third type of trading strategy that has gained prominence in recent times. A quantitative trading strategy is similar to technical trading in that it uses information relating to the stock to arrive at a purchase or sale decision. However, the matrix of factors that it takes into account to arrive at a purchase or sale decision is considerably larger compared to technical analysis. A quantitative trader uses several data points—regression analysis of trading ratios, technical data, price—to exploit inefficiencies in the market and conduct quick trades using technology.


   Special Considerations  

Trading strategies are employed to avoid behavioral finance biases and ensure consistent results. For example, traders following rules governing when to exit a trade would be less likely to succumb to the disposition effect, which causes investors to hold on to stocks that have lost value and sell those that rise in value. Trading strategies can be stress-tested under varying market conditions to measure consistency.



Profitable trading strategies are difficult to develop, however, and there is a risk of becoming over-reliant on a strategy. For instance, a trader may curve fit a trading strategy to specific backtesting data, which may engender false confidence. The strategy may have worked well in theory based on past market data, but past performance does not guarantee future success in real-time market conditions, which may vary significantly from the test period.
What Is a Trading Session?  

A trading session is a period of time that matches the primary daytime trading hours for a given locale. This phrase will refer to different hours, depending on the markets and locations being discussed. Generally a single day of business in the local financial market, from that market’s opening bell to its closing bell, is the trading session that the individual investor or trader will reference.



The markets for forex, futures, stocks, and bonds all have different characteristics that define their respective trading sessions for a given day, and the primary trading hours naturally differ from one country to another due to contrasting time zones.





Key Takeaways

A trading session is the primary trading hours and locale for a given asset.Regular trading in U.S. stocks has a clearly defined trading session from 9:30 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time (ET).The working hours of the NYSE also mark the most active period for trading within a 24-hour time period.Different markets may each have their own working hours, with forex markets encompassing many overlapping sessions across different world time zones.


   How a Trading Session Works  

Trading session hours can vary by asset class and country. The regular trading session for U.S. stocks starts at 9:30 a.m. and ends at 4:00 p.m. Eastern Time (ET) on weekdays (holidays excepted). These times are primarily driven by the working hours of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), which closes early at 1:00 p.m. ET on several occasions throughout the year associated with holidays.



The regular weekday trading session for the U.S. bond market is 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. ET. Futures markets, meanwhile, have different trading hours, depending upon the exchange and the type of commodity being traded.






Traders should be aware of trading session hours for any securities and derivatives that they’re interested in trading beforehand to prevent any unexpected problems from arising.



In addition to regular trading hours, some markets may have pre-market or after-hours trading sessions. Other markets even have 24-hour trading sessions.


   Pre-Market and After-Hours Trading Sessions  

Pre-market trading for U.S. stocks occurs between 4:00 a.m. and 9:30 a.m. ET on weekdays. After-hours trading, on the other hand, is from 4:00 p.m. to 8:00 p.m. ET on weekdays, although these times may vary slightly by exchange.



Pre-market and after-hours trading is a compelling way to capitalize on important news announcements or other factors that occur outside of regular trading hours. With that in mind, here are a number of factors that investors should be mindful of when trading outside of regular hours. In particular, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) notes eight such risk factors:



Inability to See or Act on Quotes: Some brokers only allow investors to view quotes from their own trading system rather than other electronic communication networks (ECNs).
Lack of Liquidity: There are fewer traders involved with after-hours trading, so there’s typically a lot less liquidity than during regular trading sessions.
Larger Quote Spreads: Less trading activity often translates to wider bid-ask spreads, which could make order execution difficult.
Price Volatility: There may be greater fluctuations than during regular hours, particularly if there’s a breaking news story with significant market repercussions.
Uncertain Prices: The price of stocks traded after-hours may differ from those traded during regular trading sessions.
Bias Toward Limit Orders: Many ECNs only accept limit orders rather than market orders during after-hours sessions.
Competition with Professional Traders: Many after-hours traders are professionals with large institutions that have access to more information.
Computer Delays: There is less technical support available during pre-market or after-hours trading sessions, so you could encounter trade execution delays.


   24-Hour Trading Sessions  

There are some markets with a 24-hour trading session. Among the most notable is the global foreign exchange (forex) market, in which currencies are traded. The forex market is the largest, most liquid market in the world.

What Is a Traditional IRA?  

A traditional individual retirement account (IRA) allows individuals to direct pre-tax income toward investments that can grow tax-deferred. The IRS assesses no capital gains or dividend income taxes until the beneficiary makes a withdrawal. Individual taxpayers can contribute 100% of any earned compensation up to a specified maximum dollar amount.



Income thresholds may also apply. Contributions to a traditional IRA may be tax-deductible depending on the taxpayer's income, tax-filing status, and other factors. Retirement savers may open a traditional IRA through their broker (including online brokers or robo-advisors) or financial advisor.





Key Takeaways

Traditional IRAs allow individuals to contribute pre-tax dollars to a retirement account where investments grow tax-deferred until withdrawal during retirement.Withdrawals are taxed at the IRA owner's current income tax rate upon retirement but capital gains or taxes on dividends are not assessed.Account holders should adhere to annual contribution limits and be aware of the schedules for required minimum distributions.Nonqualified withdrawals from a traditional IRA are subject to income tax in addition to a 10% penalty prior to the age of 59½ years old.Unlike Roth IRA contributions, traditional IRA contributions are deductible from your current taxable income.


   How Traditional IRAs Work  

Traditional IRAs let individuals contribute pre-tax dollars to a retirement investment account, which can grow tax-deferred until retirement withdrawals occur (at age 59½ or later). Custodians, including commercial banks and retail brokers, hold traditional IRAs and place the invested funds into different investment vehicles according to the account holder’s instruction and based on the offerings available.



Contributions to traditional IRAs are tax-deductible in most cases. For instance, if someone contributes $6,000 to their IRA, they can claim that amount as a deduction on their income tax return and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) will not apply income tax to those earnings. But when that individual withdraws money from the account during retirement, earnings are taxed at their ordinary income tax rate.



The IRS restricts contributions to a traditional IRA each year, depending on the account holder's age. The contribution limit for the 2022 tax year is $6,000 for savers under 50 years of age and $6,500 in 2023. For people aged 50 and above, higher annual contribution limits apply via a catch-up contribution provision, allowing for an additional $1,000. This means it's a total of $7,000 in 2022 and $7,500 in 2023.



Under the SECURE Act of 2019, age restrictions on contributions to a traditional IRA were lifted. As long as the account holder has earned income to qualify, they are eligible to contribute to a traditional IRA regardless of age.


   Traditional IRAs and 401(k)s or Other Employer Plans  

When you have both a traditional IRA and an employer-sponsored retirement plan, the IRS may limit the amount of your traditional IRA contributions that you can deduct from your taxes.



If a taxpayer participates in an employer-sponsored program such as a 401(k) or pension program and files as a single person, they would only be eligible to take the full deduction on a traditional IRA if their modified adjusted gross income (MAGI) was $68,000 or less for 2022. That amount increases to $73,000 for 2023). Married taxpayers filing a joint return are subject to limits of $109,000 or less for 2022 and $116,000 for the 2023 tax year.



With MAGIs of $78,000 for singles in 2022 ($83,000 for 2023) and $129,000 for married couples in 2022 ($136,000 for 2023), the IRS allows no deductions. The deduction is phased out should the filer's income fall between the minimum and maximum levels above.



IRA contributions must also be made by the tax filing deadline. For most taxpayers, this is on or around April 15th of each year. If you are above the limits, you can still contribute post-tax income to a traditional IRA and take advantage of its tax-free growth, but investigate other options, too.






Income tax is ultimately paid on IRA money at the time of withdrawal, subject to one's tax bracket during retirement. Therefore, traditional IRAs are more often recommended for investors who expect to be in lower tax brackets at retirement than they are currently in.


   Traditional IRA Distributions  

When you receive distributions from a traditional IRA, the IRS treats the money as ordinary income and subjects it to income tax. Account-holders can take distributions as early as age 59½. The age for required minimum distributions (RMDs) from traditional IRAs depends on your age and when you were born. You must begin taking distributions by April 1 the year after you turn:



73 if you turn that age on or after Jan. 1, 202372 if you turn that age between Jan. 1, 2020, and Dec. 31, 202270½ if you turned that age before Dec. 31, 2019



Funds that are withdrawn before full retirement eligibility incur a 10% penalty (of the amount withdrawn) and taxes, at standard income tax rates. There are exceptions to these penalties for certain situations. These include the following:



You plan to use the distribution towards the purchase or rebuilding of a first home for yourself or a qualified family member (limited to $10,000 per lifetime)
You become disabled before the distribution occurs
Your beneficiary receives the assets after your death
You use the assets for unreimbursed medical expenses
Your distribution is part of a substantially equal periodic payment (SEPP) program
You use the assets for higher-education expenses, or expenses incurred for having or adopting a child
You use the assets to pay for medical insurance after you lose your job
The assets are distributed as a result of an IRS levy
The amount distributed is a return on nondeductible contributions
You are in the military and called to active duty for more than 179 days



It's important for an individual to check with a tax attorney or the IRS to be sure that the particulars of their situation qualify for a waiver of the 10% penalty.


   Traditional IRAs vs. Other IRA Types  

Other variations of the IRA include the Roth IRA, SIMPLE IRA, and SEP-IRA. The last two are employer-generated, but individuals can set up a Roth IRA if they meet the income limitations. These individual accounts can be created through a broker. You can check out some of the best options with Investopedia's list of the best brokers for IRAs.


  Roth IRAs  

Unlike a traditional IRA, Roth IRA contributions are not tax-deductible and qualified distributions are tax-free. This means you contribute to a Roth IRA using after-tax dollars, but as the account grows, you do not face any taxes on investment gains. Because you paid taxes on your contributions, you can actually withdraw them, penalty-free, at any time; however, you cannot withdraw earnings until age 59½ without being subject to the 10% early-withdrawal penalty.



When you retire, you can withdraw from the account without incurring any income taxes on your withdrawals. Roth IRAs do not have RMDs. If you don't need the money, you don't have to take it out of your account and worry about penalties for failing to do so. You can also pass the money to your heirs if you don't end up needing to use it.



Roth IRA contributions are the same as traditional IRAs: $6,000 unless you are 50 or older and can qualify for the catch-up contribution, which raises the limit to $7,000 in 2022; $6,500, and $7,500, respectively, in 2023. The catch is that not everyone qualifies to contribute to a Roth IRA. There are income limitations, with contributions gradually phased out as your MAGI increases.










Income Phase-out Ranges for Roth Contributions




Filing Status 
2022 
2023 


Single
$129,000 to $144,000
$138,000 to $153,000


Heads of household
$129,000 to $144,000
$138,000 to $153,000


Married filing jointly 
$204,000 to $214,000 
$218,000 to $228,000 






If you earn above those amounts, you can't contribute to a Roth at all.


  SIMPLE and SEP-IRAs  

SIMPLE IRAs and SEP-IRAs are benefits instituted by an employer so individuals cannot open them, although self-employed or sole proprietors may. Generally, these IRAs function similarly to traditional IRAs, but they have higher contribution limits and may allow for company matching.



A simplified employee pension (SEP or SEP-IRA) is a retirement plan that an employer or self-employed individual can establish. The employer is allowed a tax deduction for contributions made to the SEP plan and makes contributions to each eligible employee's SEP-IRA on a discretionary basis. Fundamentally, a SEP-IRA can be considered a traditional IRA with the ability to receive employer contributions. One major benefit it offers employees is those employer contributions are vested immediately.



A SIMPLE IRA is a retirement savings plan that can be used by most small businesses with 100 or fewer employees. SIMPLE stands for Savings Incentive Match Plan for Employees. Employers can choose to make a 2% retirement account contribution to all employees or an optional matching contribution of up to 3%.



Employees can contribute a maximum of $14,000 annually in 2022 ($15,500 for 2023); the maximum is increased periodically to account for inflation. Retirement savers age 50 and older may make an additional catch-up contribution of $3,000, bringing their annual maximum to $17,000 in 2022. The catch-up contribution for 2023 is $3,500, bringing the total contribution amount to $19,000.


   Opening a Traditional IRA  

You can open a traditional IRA as long as you received taxable compensation during the year you want to contribute or your spouse earned taxable compensation and you will file a joint return. If both you and your spouse have compensation, both parties can open their own traditional IRA.



A variety of organizations, financial institutions, or brokerage firms can assist in setting up a personal traditional IRA. The account is subject to IRS code requirements, and the custodian of your account (often the brokerage firm you choose such as Fidelity or Vanguard) will manage the account requirements on your behalf.



Contributions into a traditional IRA can be made immediately through your account holder in the form of cash, check, or money order. Physical property is not an allowable contribution type. When setting up an account, there is no minimum balance or starting investment required.




What Is the Difference Between a Traditional IRA and Roth IRA?
The primary difference between a traditional and Roth IRA is the tax treatment of each account. Traditional IRA contributions are deductible from taxable income when the contributions are made; however, earnings are taxable. Alternatively, Roth contributions are not deductible but can grow tax-free.In addition, there are differences in the mechanisms of each IRA. Roth IRA contributions can be withdrawn for no penalty, while traditional IRAs cannot. In addition, some Roth earnings may be able to be withdrawn for no penalties for specific uses (i.e. the down payment for one's first home).




What Are the Rules for a Traditional IRA?
There are several rules for a traditional IRA. The maximum contribution amount is et every tax year, and the IRS requires individuals to begin taking money out of their traditional IRA beginning April 1 the year after they turn 73 (after Jan. 1, 2023) and 72 (if they reach that age between Jan. 1, 2020, and Dec. 31, 2022). The traditional IRA is subject to income taxes and a 10% penalty if unqualified withdrawals occur before 59½ years old. Lastly, your annual contribution to a traditional IRA can be at most what you earned in the contribution year.




What Are the Different Types of IRAs?
The two most common types of IRAs are the traditional IRA and Roth IRA. Less popular types of IRAs include SEP IRAs (often best for self-employed or small business owners), SIMPLE IRAs (often best for small companies that still have numerous employees), or self-directed IRAs (often used by experienced investors seeking specific alternative asset investments).




What Are the Disadvantages of Traditional IRAs?
Like other retirement savings vehicles, funds can often not be withdrawn without tax and fine penalties. Therefore, Traditional IRAs are very illiquid savings accounts. In addition, traditional IRAs do not grow tax-free; earnings withdrawn at retirement are subject to tax.




Does a Traditional IRA Grow Tax-Free?
No, a traditional IRA does not grow tax-free. Contributions into a traditional IRA receive favorable tax treatment and are often deducted from an employee's taxable income. When it is time to withdraw earnings, any growth on the investment is taxable. In the meantime, earnings are tax-deferred. This is the opposite treatment of Roth IRAs where initial investments cannot be deducted from income, but their growth can be withdrawn tax-free at retirement.


   The Bottom Line  

One of the more common vehicles used for saving for retirement is the traditional IRA. A traditional IRA allows savers to contribute money into a tax-deferred vehicle using post-tax (deductible) contributions. Although this investment vehicle can't be accessed until retirement without taxes and penalties, taxes on the growth of your investment is deferred until retirement.
What Is the Tragedy of the Commons?  

A common resource or "commons" is any resource, such as water or land, that provides users with tangible benefits but which nobody has an exclusive claim. The tragedy of the commons is an economic problem where the individual consumes a resource at the expense of society.



If an individual acts in their best interest, it can result in harmful over-consumption to the detriment of all. This phenomenon may result in under-investment and total depletion of a shared resource.

Investopedia / Julie Bang


   Economic Theory  

The tragedy of the commons is an economic theory claiming that individuals tend to exploit shared resources so that demand outweighs supply, and it becomes unavailable for the whole.



In 1968 evolutionary biologist Garrett Hardin published "The Tragedy of the Commons" in the peer-reviewed journal Science, which addressed the growing concern of overpopulation. Hardin used an example of sheep grazing land, taken from the early English economist William Forster Lloyd.



Grazing lands that are held as private property are prudently used by the landholder to preserve the land and the health of the herd. Common grazing lands become over-saturated with livestock because the food the animals consume is shared among all sheepherders. Hardin equated his point to humans who over-consume the commonly accessible scarce resource, making it harder to find.


   Supply and Demand  

The tragedy of the commons occurs when an economic good is rivalrous in consumption, non-excludable, scarce, and a common-pool resource. Each consumer consumes as much as they can as fast as they can before others deplete the good, and no one has the incentive to reinvest in maintaining or reproducing the good.



Rival good: A rival good is one that only one person can consume and cannot be shared. All consumers are rivals competing for that unit, and each person’s consumption subtracts from the total supply of the good.
Non-excludable: A good is non-excludable when individual consumers are unable to prevent others from also consuming it.
Scarce: The good must be scarce since a non-scarce good cannot be rivalrous in consumption.
Common-pool resource: A common-pool resource functions as a hybrid between a public and private good because it is shared and available to everyone but also scarce, with a finite supply. 


   Preventing the Tragedy of the Commons  

Institutional and technological factors play a role in the rivalry and excludability of a good. Societies have developed methods of dividing and enforcing exclusive rights to economic goods and natural resources or punishing those who over-consume common resources.


  Regulatory Solutions  

Top-down government regulation or direct control of a common-pool resource can reduce over-consumption, and government investment in the conservation and renewal of the resource can help prevent its depletion. Government regulation can limit how many cattle may graze on government lands or issue fish catch quotas.



Assigning private property rights over resources to individuals can convert a common-pool resource into a private good. Technologically it may mean developing a way to identify, measure, and mark units or parcels of the common pool resource into private holdings, such as branding cattle.



William Forster Lloyd argued for this around the time of the English Parliament’s Enclosure Acts, which stripped traditional common property arrangements to grazing lands and fields and divided the land into private holdings.


  Collective Solutions  

Economists led by Nobelist Elinor Ostrom touted customary arrangements among rural villagers and aristocratic lords, including common access to most grazing and farmlands and managing their use and conservation. Practices such as crop rotation, seasonal grazing, and enforceable sanctions against overuse and abuse of the resource meant collective action arrangements readily overcame the tragedy of the commons.






Elinor Ostrom was the first woman, and one of just two women, to win the Nobel prize in economics.



Collective action is used where technical or natural physical challenges prevent the division of a common-pool resource into small private parcels by instead relying on measures to address the good’s rivalry in consumption by regulating consumption.




Has the Tragedy of the Commons Led to Extinction of a Resource?
The extinction of the dodo bird is a historical example of the tragedy of the commons. An easy-to-hunt, flightless bird native to only a few small islands, the dodo was a source of meat for sailors traveling the southern Indian Ocean. Due to overhunting, the dodo was driven to extinction less than a century after its discovery by Dutch sailors in 1598.




Where Is the Tragedy of the Commons Evident in Industry?
Before the 1960s, the Grand Banks fishery off the coast of Newfoundland was abundant with codfish because the fishery supported all the cod fishing they could do with existing fishing technology while reproducing itself each year through the natural spawning cycle. However, advancements in fishing technology made it so fisherfolk could catch massive amounts of codfish unsupportable with natural replenishment. With no framework of property rights or institutional common regulation, the entire industry collapsed by 1990.




How Is the Tragedy of the Commons Handled When Different Nations Share Resources?
Within individual countries, governments at the local level can manage shared resources with clear boundaries. At the international level, rules regarding shared resources are difficult to enforce across jurisdictions. When resources cannot be divided, international law regarding shared resources is essentially voluntary, according to the economist Scott Barrett at Columbia University. 


   The Bottom Line  

The tragedy of the commons occurs when individuals overconsume a resource at the expense of society. When a common resource, such as water or land, is rivalrous in consumption, non-excludable, scarce, and a common-pool resource, the tragedy of the commons occurs. A common resource is any resource that provides users with tangible benefits but to which nobody has a claim.
What Is Trailing 12 Months (TTM)?  

Trailing 12 months (TTM) is a term used to describe the past 12 consecutive months of a company’s performance data, that’s used for reporting financial figures. The 12 months studied do not necessarily coincide with a fiscal-year ending period.



TTM figures are produced for a variety of metrics including earnings, EPS, P/E, and yield.





Key Takeaways

Trailing 12 months (TTM) is the term for the data from the past 12 consecutive months used for reporting financial figures.A company's trailing 12 months represents its financial performance for a 12-month period; it does not typically represent a fiscal-year ending period.The last 12 consecutive months provide investors with a compromise that is both current and seasonally adjusted.By consistently evaluating trailing 12-month numbers, company financials can be evaluated both internally and externally regardless of when the fiscal year-end is.TTM allows for a like comparison of a company's performance trajectory that smooths away inconsistencies.

   Understanding Trailing 12 Months (TTM)  

Analysts and investors use TTM to dissect a wide swath of financial data, such as balance sheet figures, income statements, and cash flows. The methodology for calculating TTM data may differ from one financial statement to the next.



In the equity research space, some analysts report earnings quarterly, while others do so annually. But investors who seek daily information about stock prices and other current data may look to TTMs as more relevant measures, because they're more current and are seasonally adjusted.



TTM figures can also be used to calculate financial ratios. The price/earnings ratio is often referred to as P/E (TTM) and is calculated as the stock's current price, divided by a company's trailing 12-month earnings per share (EPS).



Much of fundamental analysis involves comparing a measurement against a like measurement from a prior term, to decipher how much growth was realized. For example, although the company that reports $1 billion in revenues is undoubtedly impressive, this achievement is even more notable if that same company's revenues increased from $500 million to $1 billion, within the last 12 months. This marked improvement provides a clear snapshot of the company’s growth trajectory.


   Where to Find the TTM Measures  

The 12-month measure is typically reported on a company’s balance sheet, which is customarily updated on a quarterly basis, in order to comply with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), although some analysts take an average of the first quarter and the last quarter.



Line items on the cash flow statement (e.g., working capital, capital expenditures, and dividend payments) should be treated based on the feeding financial statement. For example, working capital is compiled from balance sheet line items, which are averaged. However, depreciation is deducted from income on a quarterly basis; so analysts look at the last four quarters as reported on the income statement.


   TTM Revenue  

TTM Revenue describes the revenue that a company earns over the trailing 12 months (TTM) of business. This data is instrumental in determining whether or not a company has experienced meaningful top-line growth, and can pinpoint precisely where that growth is coming from. However, this figure is often overshadowed by a company’s profitability, and its capability for generating earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA).



The formula for TTM revenue is simply to add up the previous four quarters of revenues to date.



TTM Revenue = current Q earnings + Q-1 earnings + Q-2 earnings + Q-3 earnings.



So, if XYZ Corp. generated $29.4 billion in revenue in Q1 in the quarter that just ended, $33.5 billion in the previous quarter, $30 billion the quarter before that, and $21.9 billion the one before that, TTM revenue would be: $29.4 + 33.5 + 30 + 21.9 = $87.8 billion.


   TTM Yield  

Used to analyze mutual fund or exchange-traded fund (ETF) performance, TTM yield refers to the percentage of income a portfolio has returned to investors over the last 12 months. This number is calculated by taking the weighted average of the yields of all holdings housed within a fund, whether they be stock, bonds, or other funds.



TTM yield can also refer to the dividend yield for a stock paid out over the prior 12 months. For instance, if a company with $100 stock paid out a 10-cent quarterly dividend over the past four quarters, the TTM yield would be: (0.10 + 0.10 + 0.10 + 0.10)/$100 = 0.4%.


   TTM Price/Earning Ratio  

TTM is also used in looking at the trailing P/E ratio of a company's stock. Trailing P/E is a relative valuation multiple that is based on the last 12 months of actual earnings, and is calculated by taking the current stock price and dividing it by the TTM earnings per share (EPS).



Trailing P/E Ratio = Current Share Price / TTM EPS



Trailing P/E can be contrasted with the forward P/E, which instead uses projected future earnings to calculate the price-to-earnings ratio. 




How Do You Calculate Trailing Twelve Months (TTM)?
Trailing twelve months calculations will depend on which financial metric is being considered. In general, TTM calculations will either (1) add up the figures from the previous 12 months (or four quarters) as a sum; or (2) take the average or weighted average of the previous 12 months' figures.




Is Trailing 12 Months the Same as Last Twelve Months?
Yes, last 12 months (LTM) is another term for trailing 12 months (TTM).




What Is a Trailing 12 Months Profit & Loss?
TTM P&L keeps a running tab of how well an investment or project has performed over the prior twelve-month period. It takes the monthly or quarterly returns over that time period and reports a weighted average profit or loss figure.


   The Bottom Line  

Trailing 12 months (TTM) figures report metrics based on the last 12 months (or four quarters) to date on a rolling basis. In addition to being used to measure recent trends or annual performance, TTM financial metrics are frequently used to compare the relative performance of similar companies within an industry or sector. Financial metrics commonly considered by looking at the last twelve months of figures include a company's sales, stock returns, dividend yield, price-earnings (P/E) ratio and earnings per share (EPS).
What Is Trailing Price-To-Earnings?  

Trailing price-to-earnings (P/E) is a relative valuation multiple that is based on the last 12 months of actual earnings. It is calculated by taking the current stock price and dividing it by the trailing earnings per share (EPS) for the past 12 months.



Trailing P/E can be contrasted with the forward P/E, which instead uses projected future earnings to calculate the price-to-earnings ratio. 





Key Takeaways

The trailing price-to-earnings ratio looks at a company's share price in the market relative to its past year's earnings per share.Trailing P/E is considered a useful indicator to standardize and compare relative share price between time periods and among companies.Trailing P/E, though widespread in use, is limited in that past earnings may not accurately reflect the current or future earnings situation of the company.


   Understanding Trailing Price-To-Earnings (P/E)  

The price-earnings ratio, or P/E ratio, is calculated by dividing a company's stock price by its earnings from the most recent fiscal year. When people refer to the P/E ratio generically, they are typically referring to the trailing P/E. It is calculated by dividing the current market value, or share price, by the earnings per share (EPS) over the previous 12 months.



The earnings for the most recent fiscal year can be found on the income statement in the annual report. At the bottom of the income statement is a total EPS for the firm's entire fiscal year. Divide the company's current stock price by this number to get the trailing P/E ratio.



Trailing P/E Ratio = Current Share Price / Trailing 12-Month EPS



This measure is considered the reliable since it is calculated based on actual performance rather than expected future performance. However, a company's past earnings are not necessarily always a good predictor of future earnings, and so caution is warranted


   Why Do Analysts Use P/E?  

Analysts like the P/E ratio because it creates an apples-to-apples evaluation of relative earnings. The P/E ratio can thus be used to look for relative bargains in the market or to determine when a stock is too expensive compared to others. Some companies deserve a higher P/E multiple because they have deeper economic moats, but some companies with high share price relative to earnings are simply overpriced. Likewise, some firms deserve a lower P/E because they represent a great bargain, while other company's are justified in a low P/E due to financial weakness. Trailing P/E helps analysts match time periods for a more accurate and up-to-date measure of relative value.



A disadvantage of the P/E ratio is that stock prices are constantly moving, while earnings remain fixed. Analysts attempt to deal with this issue by using the trailing price-to-earnings ratio, which uses earnings from the most recent four quarters rather than earnings from the end of the last fiscal year.


   Example of Trailing Price-To-Earnings  

For example, a company with a stock price of $50 and 12 month trailing EPS of $2, thus has a trailing P/E ratio of 25x (read 25 times). This means that the company's stock is trading at 25x its trailing 12 month earnings.



Using the same example, if the company's stock price falls to $40 midway through the year, the new P/E ratio is 20x, which means the stock's price is now trading at only 20x its earnings. Earnings have not changed, but the stock's price has dropped.



Earnings for the last two quarters may have also dropped. In this case, analysts can substitute the first two-quarters of the fiscal year calculation with the most recent two quarters for a trailing P/E ratio. If earnings in the first half of the year, represented by the most recent two quarters, are trending lower, the P/E ratio will be higher than 20x. This tells analysts that the stock may actually be overvalued at the current price given its declining level of earnings.


   Trailing vs. Forward P/E  

The trailing P/E ratio differs from the forward P/E, which uses earnings estimates or forecasts for the next four quarters or next projected 12 months of earnings. As a result, forward P/E can sometimes be more relevant to investors when evaluating a company. Nonetheless, as forward P/E relies on estimated future earnings, it is prone to miscalculation and/or the bias of analysts. Companies may also underestimate or mis-state earnings in order to beat consensus estimate P/E in the next quarterly earnings report.



Both ratios are useful during acquisitions. The trailing P/E ratio is an indicator of past performance of the company being acquired. Forward P/E represents the company's guidance for the future. Typically valuations of the acquired company are based on the latter ratio. However, the buyer can use an earnout provision to lower the acquisition price, with the option of making an additional payout if the targeted earnings are achieved.
What Is a Trailing Stop?  

A trailing stop is a modification of a typical stop order that can be set at a defined percentage or dollar amount away from a security's current market price. For a long position, an investor places a trailing stop loss below the current market price. For a short position, an investor places the trailing stop above the current market price.



A trailing stop is designed to protect gains by enabling a trade to remain open and continue to profit as long as the price is moving in the investor’s favor. The order closes the trade if the price changes direction by a specified percentage or dollar amount.



A trailing stop is typically placed at the same time the initial trade is placed, although it may also be placed after the trade.





Key Takeaways

A trailing stop is an order type designed to lock in profits or limit losses as a trade moves favorably.Trailing stops only move if the price moves favorably. Once it moves to lock in a profit or reduce a loss, it does not move back in the other direction.A trailing stop is a stop order and has the additional option of being a limit order or a market order.One of the most important considerations for a trailing stop order is whether it will be a percentage or fixed-dollar amount and by how much it will trail the price.

   Understanding a Trailing Stop  

Trailing stops only move in one direction because they are designed to lock in profit or limit losses. If a 10% trailing stop loss is added to a long position, a sell trade will be issued if the price drops 10% from its peak price after purchase. The trailing stop only moves up once a new peak has been established. Once the trailing stop has moved up, it cannot move back down.



A trailing stop is more flexible than a fixed stop-loss order, as it automatically tracks the stock's price direction and does not have to be manually reset like the fixed stop-loss.



Investors can use trailing stops in any asset class, assuming the broker provides that order type for the market being traded. Trailing stops can be set as limit orders or market orders.






   Trading with Trailing Stop Orders  

The key to using a trailing stop successfully is to set it at a level that is neither too tight nor too wide. Placing a trailing stop loss that is too tight could mean the trailing stop is triggered by normal daily market movement, and thus the trade has no room to move in the trader's direction. A stop loss that is too tight will usually result in a losing trade, albeit a small one. A trailing stop that is too large will not be triggered by normal market movements, but it does mean the trader is taking on the risk of unnecessarily large losses, or giving up more profit than they need to.



While trailing stops lock in profit and limit losses, establishing the ideal trailing stop distance is difficult. There is no ideal distance because markets and the way that stocks move are always changing. Despite this, trailing stops are effective tools. Every exit method has its pros and cons.






The ideal trailing stop loss will change over time. During more volatile periods, a wider trailing stop is a better bet. During quieter times, or in a very stable stock, a tighter trailing stop loss may be effective. That said, once a trailing stop loss is set for an individual trade it should be kept as is. A common trading mistake is to increase risk once in a trade in order to avoid losses. This is called loss aversion (disposition effect in the context of markets), and it can cripple a trading account quickly.


   Example of a Trailing Stop  

Assume you bought Alphabet Inc. (GOOG) at $1,000. By looking at prior advances in the stock you see that the price will often experience a pullback of 5% to 8% before moving higher again. These prior movements can help establish the percentage level to use for a trailing stop.



Choosing 3%, or even 5%, may be too tight. Even minor pullbacks tend to move more than this, which means the trade is likely to be stopped out by the trailing stop before the price has a chance to move higher.



Choosing a 20% trailing stop is excessive. Based on the recent trends, the average pullback is about 6%, with bigger ones near 8%.



A better trailing stop loss would be 10% to 12%. This gives the trade room to move but also gets the trader out quickly if the price drops by more than 12%. A 10% to 12% drop is larger than a typical pullback which means something more significant could be going on—mainly, this could be a trend reversal instead of just a pullback.



Using a 10% trailing stop, your broker will execute a sell order if the price drops 10% below your purchase price. This is $900. If the price never moves above $1,000 after you buy, your stop loss will stay at $900. If the price reaches $1,010, your stop loss will move up to $909, which is 10% below $1,010. If the stock moves up to $1250, your broker will execute an order to sell if the price falls to $1,125. If the price starts falling from $1,250 and does not go back up, your trailing stop order stays at $1,125, and if the price drops to that price the broker will enter a sell order on your behalf.




Why Should I Use a Trailing Stop?
Traders and investors can enhance the efficacy of a stop-loss by pairing it with a trailing stop, which is a trade order where the stop-loss price isn't fixed at a single, absolute dollar amount, but is rather set at a certain percentage or dollar amount below the current market price that is constantly revised as the market moves up (for a long position). Trailing stops may be used with stock, options, and futures exchanges that support traditional stop-loss orders.




How Does a Trailing Stop Work?
When the price of a security with a trailing stop increases, it "drags" the trailing stop up along with it. Then when the price finally stops rising, the new stop-loss price remains at the level it was dragged to, thus automatically protecting an investor's downside, while locking in profits as the price reaches new highs. Many online brokers provide this service at no additional cost.




How Can Market Psychology Help Me With Trailing Stops?
During momentary price dips, it's crucial to resist the impulse to reset your trailing stop, or else your effective stop-loss may end up lower than expected. By the same token, reining in a trailing stop-loss is advisable when you see momentum peaking in the charts, especially when the stock is hitting a new high.


   The Bottom Line  

Deciding how to determine the exit points of your positions depends on how conservative you are as a trader. If you tend to be aggressive, you may determine your profitability levels and acceptable losses by means of a less precise approach like the setting of trailing stops according to fundamental criteria. Shrewd traders always maintain the option of closing out a position at any time by submitting a sell order at the market.
What Are Tranches?  

Tranches are segments created from a pool of securities—usually debt instruments such as bonds or mortgages—that are divvied up by risk, time to maturity, or other characteristics in order to be marketable to different investors. Each portion or tranche of a securitized or structured product is one of several related securities offered at the same time, but with varying risks, rewards and maturities to appeal to a diverse range of investors.



Tranche is a French word meaning slice or portion.﻿﻿ They are commonly found in mortgage-backed securities (MBS) or asset-backed securities (ABS).





key takeaways

Tranches are pieces of a pooled collection of securities, usually debt instruments, that are split up by risk or other characteristics in order to be marketable to different investors.Tranches carry different maturities, yields, and degrees of risk—and privileges in repayment in case of default.Tranches are common in securitized products like CDOs and CMOs.


   The Basics of Tranches  

Tranches in structured finance are a fairly recent development, spurred by the increased use of securitization to divide up sometimes-risky financial products with steady cash flows to then sell these divisions to other investors. The word tranche comes from the French word for slice.﻿﻿ The discrete tranches of a larger asset pool are usually defined in transaction documentation and assigned different classes of notes, each with a different bond credit rating.



Senior tranches typically contain assets with higher credit ratings than junior tranches. The senior tranches have first lien on the assets—they're in line to be repaid first, in case of default. Junior tranches have a second lien or no lien at all.



Examples of financial products that can be divided into tranches include bonds, loans, insurance policies, mortgages and other debts.






   Tranches in Mortgage-Backed Securities  

A tranche is a common financial structure for securitized debt products, such as a collateralized debt obligation (CDO), which pools together a collection of cash flow-generating assets—such as mortgages, bonds, and loans—or a mortgage-backed security. An MBS is made of multiple mortgage pools that have a wide variety of loans, from safe loans with lower interest rates to risky loans with higher rates. Each specific mortgage pool has its own time to maturity, which factors into the risk and reward benefits. Therefore, tranches are made to divide up the different mortgage profiles into slices that have financial terms suitable for specific investors.



For example, a collateralized mortgage obligation (CMO) offering a partitioned mortgage-backed securities portfolio might have mortgage tranches with one-year, two-year, five-year and 20-year maturities, all with varying yields. If an investor wants to buy a MBS, they can choose the tranche type most applicable to their appetite for return and aversion to risk. A Z tranche is the lowest-ranked tranche of a CMO in terms of seniority. Its owners are not entitled to any coupon payments, receiving no cash flow from underlying mortgages until the more senior tranches are retired, or paid off.



Investors receive monthly cash flow based on the MBS tranche in which they invested. They can either try to sell it and make a quick profit or hold onto it and realize small but long-term gains in the form of interest payments. These monthly payments are bits and pieces of all the interest payments made by homeowners whose mortgage is included in a specific MBS.


   Investment Strategy in Choosing Tranches  

Investors who desire to have long-term steady cash flow will invest in tranches with a longer time to maturity. Investors who need a more immediate but a more lucrative income stream will invest in tranches with less time to maturity. 



All tranches, regardless of interest and maturity, allow investors to customize investment strategies to their specific needs. Conversely, tranches help banks and other financial institutions attract investors across many different profile types.



Tranches add to the complexity of debt investing and sometimes pose a problem to uninformed investors, who run the risk of choosing a tranches unsuitable to their investment goals.



Tranches can also be miscategorized by credit rating agencies. If they are given a higher rating than deserved, it can cause investors to be exposed to riskier assets than they intended to be. Such mislabeling played a part in the mortgage meltdown of 2007 and subsequent financial crisis. Tranches containing junk bonds or sub-prime mortgages (below-investment-grade assets) were labeled AAA or the equivalent, either through incompetence, carelessness or, as some charged, outright corruption on the agencies' part.


   Real-World Example of Tranches  

After the financial crisis of 2007-09, an explosion of lawsuits occurred against issuers of CMOs, CDOs and other debt securities—and among investors in the products themselves, all of which was dubbed "tranche warfare" in the press. An April 2008 story in the Financial Times noted that investors in the senior tranches of failed CDOs were taking advantage of their priority status to seize control of assets and cut off payments to other debt-holders. CDO trustees, such as Deutsche Bank and Wells Fargo, filed suits to ensure all tranche investors continued to receive funds.



And in 2009, the manager of Greenwich, Conn.-based hedge fund Carrington Investment Partners filed a lawsuit against the mortgage-servicing company American Home Mortgage Servicing. The hedge fund held junior tranches of mortgage-backed securities that contained loans made on foreclosed properties that American Home was selling for (allegedly) low prices—thus crippling the tranche's yield. Carrington argued in the complaint that its interests as a junior tranche-holder were in line with those of the senior tranche-holders.﻿﻿
What Is a Transaction?  

A transaction is a completed agreement between a buyer and a seller to exchange goods, services, or financial assets in return for money. The term is also commonly used in corporate accounting. In business bookkeeping, this plain definition can get tricky. A transaction may be recorded by a company earlier or later depending on whether it uses accrual accounting or cash accounting.





Key Takeaways

A transaction involves a monetary exchange for a good or service.Transactions can be a little more tricky when it comes to corporate accounting.Accrual accounting recognizes a transaction immediately after it is finalized, regardless of when payment is received or made.Cash accounting is used mostly by smaller businesses and records a transaction only when money is received or paid out.Third-party transactions can often complicate the process. 


   Understanding Transactions  

A sales transaction between a buyer and a seller is relatively straightforward. Person A pays person B in exchange for a product or service. When they agree on the terms, money is exchanged for the good or service and the transaction is complete.



Transactions can be more complex in the accounting world because businesses may make a deal today which won't be settled until a future date. Or, they may have revenues or expenses that are known but not yet due. Third-party transactions can also complicate the process.



Whether a business records income and expense transactions using the accrual method of accounting or the cash method of accounting affects the company’s financial and tax reporting.



The accrual accounting method requires a transaction to be recorded when it occurs, regardless of when the money is received or the expenses are paid.
The cash accounting method records a transaction only when the money is received or the expenses are paid. This may require a letter of intent or a memorandum of understanding.






Whereas accrual accounting is used most often by businesses with an average of over $26 million over the prior three years, cash accounting is used primarily by small businesses.


   Transactions Using Accrual Accounting  

When accrual accounting is used, a company records income when completing a service or delivering goods. If an inventory is required when accounting for a company’s income and the company has gross receipts with an average of over $26 million over the prior three years, the company normally uses the accrual method of accounting for sales and purchases.


  Examples of Accrual Accounting  

A company selling merchandise to a customer on store credit in October records the transaction immediately as an item in accounts receivable (AR). Even if the customer does not make a cash payment on the merchandise until December or pays in installments, the transaction is recorded as income for October.



The same goes for goods or services the company purchases. Business expenses are recorded when the products or services are received. Supplies purchased on credit in April are recorded as expenses for April, even if the business does not make a cash payment on the supplies until May.






If a customer buys something on credit, it will immediately be recorded as a transaction if the company selling the good uses the accrual accounting method.


   Transactions Using Cash Accounting  

Most small businesses, especially sole proprietorships and partnerships, use the cash accounting method. Income is recorded when cash, checks, or credit card payments are received from customers.


  Examples of Cash Accounting  

Let's say a business sells $10,000 of widgets to a customer in March. The customer pays the invoice in April. The company recognizes the sale only after the cash is received in April.



Meanwhile, expenses are recorded only when a payment is made. A business may purchase $500 of office supplies in May, for example, and pay for them in June. The business recognizes the purchase when it pays the bill in June.



For tax reasons, the cash basis of accounting is available only if a company has an average of less than $26 million over the prior three years in annual sales. The cash basis is easier than the accrual basis for recording transactions because no complex accounting transactions, such as accruals and deferrals, are necessary. Its drawback is that the profit of the business may vary wildly from month to month, at least on paper.




What Is an ACH Transaction?
An ACH transaction is an electronic payment made between banks. They are processed through the Automated Clearing House. Examples of ACH transactions include direct deposits for things like your salary or tax refund, and bill payments that are made online or through your bank.




How Do I Cancel a Pending Transaction?
Pending transactions are those that have been made but aren't posted to your account. These include payments, purchases, pre-authorized debits, and any other related transactions. Purchases made with a debit or credit card are held for a certain period of time before they work their way through the electronic system from your bank to the recipients. Contact the merchant and/or your bank to request a reversal if, for whatever reason, you want to cancel the transaction.




How Are Transactions Different in Accounting?
Accounting transactions are a little different because of the way they may be recorded. In the accrual method of accounting, transactions are recorded once they are executed. But in the cash accounting method, transactions are recorded only when money is received or paid.


   The Bottom Line  

A transaction signals a financial agreement between two parties where one benefits financially by selling goods and services to another. In simple terms, a transaction is completed when the goods and services change hands for money. But things get a little complicated when it comes to transactions in accounting. Businesses that use the accrual method of accounting record transactions when they are completed. In the cash method, they are documented only when payments are made or received.
What Are Transaction Costs?  

Transaction costs are expenses incurred when buying or selling a good or service. Transaction costs represent the labor required to bring a good or service to market, giving rise to entire industries dedicated to facilitating exchanges. In a financial sense, transaction costs include brokers' commissions and spreads, which are the differences between the price the dealer paid for a security and the price the buyer pays.





Key Takeaways

Transaction costs are the payments that banks and brokers receive from buyers and sellers for their roles.Transaction costs are one of the key determinants of net returns.Different asset classes have different ranges of transaction costs; investors should select assets with costs that are at the low end of the range for their types.Transaction costs are only incurred when purchases or sales are made; ongoing fees are charges related to the passage of time.Traders can minimize transaction fees by aggregating trades or taking on a more passive investment strategy.


   Understanding Transaction Costs  

The transaction costs to buyers and sellers are the payments that banks and brokers receive for their roles. There are also transaction costs in buying and selling real estate, which include the agent's commission and closing costs, such as title search fees, appraisal fees, and government fees. Another type of transaction cost is the time and labor associated with transporting goods or commodities across long distances.



Transaction costs are important to investors because they are one of the key determinants of net returns. Transaction costs diminish returns, and over time, high transaction costs can mean thousands of dollars lost from not just the costs themselves but also because the costs reduce the amount of capital available to invest.



Fees, such as mutual fund expense ratios, have the same effect. Different asset classes have different ranges of standard transaction costs and fees. All else being equal, investors should select assets whose costs are at the low end of the range for their types.


   Ongoing vs. Transaction Costs  

Though similar in nature, ongoing fees and transaction costs are technically different. Ongoing fees are fees that are charged periodically over the life of the product or service. These fees are typically associated with products or services that require ongoing maintenance or management such as being involved in an investment fund. Transaction costs are fees that are charged each time a specific transaction occurs. Both types of fees may be percentage based on a related dollar amount or related to a fixed dollar amount.



This distinction is important, especially when reviewing what your broker offers. Though you may go to great lengths to avoid transaction costs, your broker may still impose quarterly ongoing fees that can not be avoided as long as your brokerage account is open. In addition, there may be opportunities to incur one type of transaction in exchange for another. For instance, some brokers may charge an ongoing fee for certain account access that gives greater incentives such as lower or no transaction costs.






Sometimes, it is simply impossible to avoid transaction costs. These costs are simply an inherent part of being involved in a certain market or activity.


   Elimination of Transaction Costs  

When transaction costs diminish, an economy becomes more efficient, and more capital and labor are freed to produce wealth. A shift of this nature does not come without growing pains, as the labor market must adjust to its new environment.



One type of transaction cost is a barrier to communication. When an otherwise perfectly matched seller and buyer have absolutely zero means of communication, the transaction costs of a deal are too high to be overcome. A bank serves the role of the middleman by connecting savings with investments and a prosperous economy justifies the income of the bank for the transaction cost of compiling information and linking parties.



However, the Age of Information, specifically the influx of the internet and telecommunications, has greatly reduced barriers to communication. Consumers no longer need large institutions and their agents to make educated purchases. For this reason, the survival of the insurance agent is being jeopardized by a wide range of technology startups that run websites either selling or promoting insurance policies. The easy access to information and communication that the internet provides has also threatened the livelihood of jobs, such as the real estate agent, stockbroker, and car salesman. It is considered to be what destroyed Scottrade.



In essence, the prices of many goods and services have lowered due to a reduction in barriers to communication between everyday individuals. Retailers and merchandisers serve the role of middlemen as well, by pairing consumers with manufacturers. With the rise of e-commerce transactions, consumers may find it more efficient to enter into digital transactions to have their consumption needs met. However, in many ways, this has simply shifted the type of transaction cost incurred in respect to brick-and-mortar services.






If you're not quite sure where to start when evaluating your transaction fees, consider guidance from the SEC regarding the best questions to ask.


   Example of Transaction Costs  

According to Fidelity, the load for mutual funds ranges from 1% to 2%. This load fee pays the brokers as an incentive for choosing one mutual fund over another. Fidelity also notes that financial advisors may receive payment via commission or an annual percentage of your entire portfolio. The annual percentage often ranges between 0.5% and 2.0%.



Also consider that most mutual funds may charge an investor a marketing fee called a 12b-1 fee. This fee may range from 0.25% to 1% depending on whether the fee is front-loaded or back-loaded. As opposed to many other types of mutual fund fees, this fee is usually a one-time transaction. Though it's often disclosed as a marketing fee, a wide majority of the 12b-1 fee is often paid to the broker who sold you the fund.




Are Transaction Costs Legal?
Yes, transaction costs charged to buying and selling goods is often legal. Because there are intermediaries that facilitate the transfer of a good from one party to the other, these fees often are paid to the party that helped make the exchange occur. In addition, different government entities or regulatory bodies may impose transaction costs to help the facilitation of future goods.




How Can I Avoid Transaction Fees?
In many cases, transaction fees cannot be eliminated. This is especially true where intermediaries are needed such as buying or selling securities. To minimize the amount of fees paid, consider minimizing the number of transactions you enter into and lump transactions together to potentially minimize the per-transaction charges. In addition, consider seeking brokers that offer free trades for select types of contracts.




What Happens If Transaction Costs Are Too High?
Consider the implications of high transaction costs over time. Assume you begin investing $10,000 per year for 30 years and earn a steady 6% per year. Your gross ending value will be approximately $838,000. However, if your annual fund expense is 1%, you will pay over $140,000 of fees over the life of your investment. This would reduce your ending portfolio value to less than $700,000.


   The Bottom Line  

Transaction costs are often necessary to reward intermediaries to facilitate the exchange of a good. This is especially prevalent in the investment world where brokers, regulatory agencies, or other entities impose fees on trades or transactions. Be mindful of the fees your broker charges, and consider implementing strategies such as bulk trades, passive investing, or fewer contracts to minimize these fees.
What Is Transaction Exposure?  

Transaction exposure is the level of uncertainty businesses involved in international trade face. Specifically, it is the risk that currency exchange rates will fluctuate after a firm has already undertaken a financial obligation. A high level of vulnerability to shifting exchange rates can lead to major capital losses for these international businesses.



Transaction exposure is also known as translation exposure or translation risk.





Key Takeaways

Transaction exposure is the level of uncertainty faced by companies involved in international trade due to currency fluctuations.A high level of exposure to exchange rates can lead to major losses, although certain measures can be taken to hedge those risks.The risk of transaction exposure generally only impacts one side of a transaction, namely the business that completes the transaction in a foreign currency.


   Understanding Transaction Exposure  

The danger of transaction exposure is typically one-sided. Only the business that completes a transaction in a foreign currency may feel the vulnerability. The entity that is receiving or paying a bill using its home currency is not subjected to the same risk.



Usually, the buyer agrees to buy the product using foreign money. If this is the case, the hazard comes if that foreign currency should appreciate, as this would result in the buyer needing to spend more than they had budgeted for the goods.






The risk for exchange rate fluctuations increases if more time passes between the agreement and the contract settlement.


   Combating Transaction Exposure  

One way that firms can limit their exposure to changes in the exchange rate is to implement a hedging strategy. By purchasing currency swaps or hedging through futures contracts, a company is able to lock in a rate of currency exchange for a set period of time and minimize translation risk.



In addition, a company can request that clients pay for goods and services in the currency of the company's country of domicile. This way, the risk associated with local currency fluctuation is not borne by the company but instead by the client, who is responsible for making the currency exchange prior to conducting business with the company.


   Example of Transaction Exposure  

Suppose that a United States-based company is looking to purchase a product from a company in Germany. The American company agrees to negotiate the deal and pay for the goods using the German company's currency, the euro. Assume that when the U.S. firm begins the process of negotiation, the value of the euro/dollar exchange is a 1-to-1.5 ratio. This rate of exchange equates to one euro being equivalent to 1.50 U.S. dollars (USD).



Once the agreement is complete, the sale might not take place immediately. Meanwhile, the exchange rate may change before the sale is final. This risk of change is transaction exposure.



While it is possible that the values of the dollar and the euro may not change, it is also possible that the rates could become more or less favorable for the U.S. company, depending on factors affecting the currency marketplace. When it's time to conclude the sale and make the payment, the exchange rate ratio might have shifted to a more favorable 1-to-1.25 rate or a less favorable 1-to-2 rate.



Regardless of the change in the value of the dollar relative to the euro, the German company experiences no transaction exposure because the deal took place in its local currency. The German company is not affected if it costs the U.S. company more dollars to complete the transaction because the price, as dictated by the sales agreement, was set in euros.
What Are Per-Transaction Fees?  

A per-transaction fee is an expense a business must pay each time it processes an electronic payment for a customer transaction. Per-transaction fees vary across service providers, typically costing merchants from 0.5% to 5% of the transaction amount plus certain fixed fees.





Key Takeaways

A per-transaction fee is an expense that businesses pay a service provider each time a customer payment is processed electronically.The per-transaction fee can vary depending on the service provider but usually ranges between 0.5% and 5% plus certain fixed fees.Merchants partner with merchant acquiring banks to set up the electronic payment process and the deposit account for the funds.A per-transaction fee usually consists of an acquirer fee and a processor fee.


   How Per-Transaction Fees Work  

Per-transaction fees are required of the merchant from a few different entities in a transaction. Merchants partner with merchant acquiring banks to facilitate all of the communications in an electronic payment transaction.



Merchants also set up a merchant account with the acquirer, which serves as the merchant’s primary deposit account for funds from each transaction. A merchant who receives a lot of electronic payments will rely heavily on the merchant acquiring bank, making the terms of the merchant account agreement an important factor for a merchant.


   Components of Per-Transaction Fees  

Merchants pay a variety of fees related to the acceptance of electronic payments. Some fees will vary while others are fixed. Merchants have a wide range of acquiring banks they can partner with for electronic payment services. Each acquirer has different fee structures and service capabilities allowing merchants to choose the acquirer that is best for them.






Acquirers will typically charge per-transaction fees as well as a monthly fee for the management of a merchant account.



The second component of a per-transaction fee is the fee paid to the network processing company. Merchants establish the types of branded cards they can accept at their store based on the processing network of their merchant acquiring bank.



Payment card companies such as MasterCard, Visa, Discover, or American Express each have their per-transaction fees that will be charged to the merchant in a transaction. Payment card company fees, also called wholesale fees, are usually a fixed fee per transaction. Some acquirers may be able to negotiate lower wholesale fees through network relationships with processors.



Acquirer and processor fees are the main components of a comprehensive per-transaction fee. In some cases, other fees for a merchant may also apply. One added cost merchants might encounter is a terminal fee which is a per-transaction fee charged to a terminal provider such as Square for the use of a terminal in an electronic payment card transaction.



Per-transaction fees are the reason why some merchants impose a minimum that customers must spend if they want to pay with a credit or debit card. For example, merchants may set a $5 or $10 minimum for credit card and debit card transactions. Smaller merchants who are less able to absorb excess card fees are more likely to impose these minimums.






American Express, Visa, MasterCard, and Discover all charge approximately the same fees, with slight variations that amount to cents in some of the components. Generally, Visa charges the lowest total amount. This depends on the cards used as well, as cards with rewards often have higher fees.

Acquirers will detail a merchant’s total monthly costs and transaction activities in a monthly statement. Generally, service provider transaction fees will be delineated in one of three categories: interchange, tiered, or subscription.



The interchange section lists the payment card company fees and service provider fees separately on the merchant’s monthly statement. The tiered section assesses different fees based on the transaction type, such as in-person versus online. Subscription fees are also assessed on a monthly or annual basis.




How Can I Avoid Transaction Fees?
You can avoid transaction fees by paying for a purchase with cash. However, if you are using a credit card, there will be a per-transaction fee charged to the merchant. If the merchant does not want to pay the fee, they may raise their prices so customers would effectively be subsidizing the fee.




Who Pays Credit Card Transaction Fees?
A credit card transaction fee is charged to the merchant or vendor, not the cardholder. Businesses pay the card transaction fees to the credit card issuer or payment processor company.




Can Businesses Charge a Credit Card Surcharge?
A merchant is responsible for paying a credit card transaction fee, and some merchants charge a credit card surcharge to recoup this expense. However, in some states it is illegal for merchants to charge a credit card surcharge.


   The Bottom Line  

Per-transaction fees are charged to merchants, not consumers, but you may be affected by these fees if the merchant adjusts prices to recoup their expenses. Merchants, especially smaller businesses, may also set minimum purchase amounts if you are using a credit card so that they do not lose money on a transaction.
What Is a Transfer Agent?  

A transfer agent is a trust company, bank, or similar institution assigned by a corporation for the purposes of maintaining an investor's financial records and tracking each investor's account balance. The transfer agent records transactions, cancels and issues certificates, processes investor mailings, and handles a host of other investor problems, including reissuing lost or stolen certificates.



Transfer agents work closely with registrars to ensure investors receive their due interest and dividend payments in a timely manner. Transfer agents likewise oversee the mailing of monthly investment statements to mutual fund shareholders.





Key Takeaways

A transfer agent plays a vital role in acting as a liaison between a company's registrar and an investor.Transfer agents closely maintain an investor's account balances and electronically maintain certificates of security ownership.Stock transfer agents make sure shareholders receive dividend payments in a timely manner.Bond transfer agents make sure bondholders receive their due interest payments, plus the face value of the bond, once it reaches maturity.

   Understanding Transfer Agent  

Traditionally, when investors purchased a security, they received a physical paper certificate. Today, transfer agents issue certificates in book-entry form—an electronic method of recording securities ownership that saves vast amounts of time and money. These book-entry securities vary depending on the investment.



For example, bonds are often issued in $1,000 multiples, while stock and mutual fund holdings are issued as shares. Meanwhile, unit investment trusts (UIT) are sold in block units. Transfer agents process all types of securities in book-entry form, in whatever necessary shape they must take.






It's possible to identify which transfer agent a company uses by checking out the investor relations section of its website.


   Transfer Agent Responsibilities  

Common and preferred stock shareholders have the right to vote on major corporate decisions, such as merger activities and the sale of companies. These votes are facilitated through transfer agents, who send proxy information to shareholders.



Transfer agents likewise furnish shareholders with annual reports, including companies' audited financial statements. And at year-end, transfer agents and registrars jointly send federal tax information to investors, including dividends information and interest paid, along with data on security trades executed during the year.


   Distribution of Funds and Shares  

Transfer agents pay distributions to investors, based on the registrar's records. For example, transfer agents send interest payments to bondholders, as well as the face value of their bonds, once they reach maturity. Similarly, transfer agents send cash dividend payments to stock investors once the companies they invest in generate sufficient earnings.



Transfer agents also send stock shares to investors after a stock split. If, for example, the company has a 3-for-1 stock split, each shareholder receives two additional shares for every share they already own.






If investors hold securities in their own names and wish to transfer or sell those securities, they may need to get their signatures guaranteed before the transfer agent will accept the transactions.


   Mutual Fund Transfer Agents  

Mutual fund transfer agents differ from stock transfer agents in that the former never issue physical certificates, whereas the latter must do so on shareholder request. However, mutual fund transfer agents perform many other important tasks, like maintaining records of shareholders' accounts, overseeing dividend payments, and responding to shareholder requests for account statements, income tax forms, and transaction confirmations.


   Benefits of Transfer Agents  

All shareholders are entitled to accurate information about their investments. While some corporations choose to act as their own transfer agents, other companies decide to use third-parties like trust companies, banks, or similar financial institutions. These companies receive fees for their services. 



These third-party companies specialize in providing transfer agent services and many corporations find the expense of hiring a third-party company well worth it. Transfer agents handle a detailed and challenging job, especially for large corporations with many shareholders. For example, it's not uncommon for a publicly traded company to issue millions of shares of stock. Someone has to keep all of the information relevant to those millions of shares in order.



It's part of the company's fiduciary responsibility to its shareholders to ensure that all investor records, account balances, and transactions are safeguarded and accurately tracked. Transfer agents fulfill this vital role in maintaining records and providing investors with timely and reliable information.




What is the difference between a broker and a transfer agent?
A transfer agent acts as a liaison between a company's registrar and an investor. A broker, on the other hand, acts as an intermediary between an investor and an exchange, buying and selling securities for its clients.




Who needs a transfer agent?
Publicly traded companies listed on a stock exchange need transfer agents to maintain records of shareholder accounts, calculate and distribute dividends, and keep investors up to date with what’s going on. Mutual funds and issuers of debt securities also rely on transfer agents for similar reasons.




How much do transfer agents make?
According to Glassdoor, the average total pay of a transfer agent in the U.S. is $52,854 per year. That’s based on an average salary of $41,323 and additional payments, such as bonuses and commissions, of $11,531. The range is quite wide, though. The highest-paid transfer agent could make up to about $89,000.


   The Bottom Line  

Companies use transfer agents to keep track of the individuals and entities that own their stocks and bonds. Most of the time they get these agents from third parties, such as trust companies, banks, or similar financial institutions.



The main duties of a transfer agent are to keep a record of who owns a company’s stocks and bonds, issue and cancel certificates to reflect changes in ownership, and payout distributions, and send useful information to stakeholders, such as annual reports and how to vote at meetings. The transfer agent essentially acts as a liaison between a company and its investors.
What Is Transfer of Risk?  

A transfer of risk is a business agreement in which one party pays another to take responsibility for mitigating specific losses that may or may not occur. This is the underlying tenet of the insurance industry.



Risks may be transferred between individuals, from individuals to insurance companies, or from insurers to reinsurers. When homeowners purchase property insurance, they are paying an insurance company to assume various specific risks associated with homeownership.


   Understanding Transfer of Risk  

When purchasing insurance, the insurer agrees to indemnify, or compensate, the policyholder up to a certain amount for a specified loss or losses in exchange for payment.





Key Takeaways

A transfer of risk shifts responsibility for losses from one party to another in return for payment.The basic business model of the insurance industry is the acceptance and management of risk.This system works because some risks are beyond the resources of most individuals and businesses.



Insurance companies collect premiums from thousands or millions of customers every year. That provides a pool of cash that is available to cover the costs of damage or destruction to the properties of some small percentage of its customers. The premiums also cover administrative and operating expenses, and provide the company's profits.



Life insurance works the same way. Insurers rely on actuarial statistics and other information to project the number of death claims it can expect to pay out per year. Because this number is relatively small, the company sets its premiums at a level that will exceed those death benefits.






Reinsurance companies accept transfers of risk from insurance companies.



The insurance industry exists because few individuals or companies have the financial resources necessary to bear the risks of the loss on their own. So, they transfer the risks.


   Risk Transfer to Reinsurance Companies  

Some risks are too big for insurance companies to bear alone. That's where reinsurance comes in.



When insurance companies don't want to assume too much risk, they transfer the excess risk to reinsurance companies. For example, an insurance company may routinely write policies that limit its maximum liability to $10 million. But it may take on policies that require higher maximum amounts and then transfer the remainder of the risk in excess of $10 million to a reinsurer. This subcontract comes into play only if a major loss occurs.


   Property Insurance Risk Transfer  

Purchasing a home is the most significant expense most individuals make. To protect their investment, most homeowners buy homeowners insurance. With homeowners insurance, some of the risks associated with homeownership are transferred from the homeowner to the insurer.



Insurance companies typically assess their own business risks in order to determine whether a customer is acceptable, and at what premium. Underwriting insurance for a customer with a poor credit profile and several dogs is riskier than insuring someone with a perfect credit profile and no pets. The policy for the first applicant will command a higher premium because of the higher risk being transferred from the applicant to the insurer.
What Is Transfer on Death (TOD)?  

The transfer on death (TOD) designation lets someone receive assets at the time of their benefactor's death without going through probate. A TOD designation also lets the account holder or security owner specify the percentage of assets each person receives, which helps the executor distribute the person's assets after death.



With a transfer on death registration, the named beneficiaries have no access to or control over a person's assets as long as the person is alive.



A transfer on death designation is generally used for brokerage accounts, stocks, bonds, and other investment types.





Key Takeaways

Transfer on death (TOD) applies to certain assets that must be passed on without going through probate.Those named in a TOD don't have access to the assets before the owner's death.To execute a TOD, the brokerage must receive the appropriate documents to verify the assets can be transferred.


   Understanding Transfer on Death (TOD)  

It is important that beneficiaries of a TOD are aware of the assets they will inherit so they may prepare accordingly ahead of time. Transfers on Death ensure an investor's securities and security-related accounts are passed on to the person or people they want them to be passed to without going through a lengthy probate process.



The Uniform Transfer on Death Securities Registration Act lets owners name beneficiaries for their stocks, bonds, or brokerage accounts. When someone registers with a stockbroker or bank, they are the owner of that account. They can then name beneficiaries and percentage allocations on the beneficiary form provided by the broker or bank.






Individual retirement accounts, 401(k)s, and other retirement accounts are not TOD accounts. These have named beneficiaries, with regulations determining when you can begin making withdrawals, how much you can withdraw, or how they are taxed. A TOD simply transfers all assets associated with an account to the people named.


   Transfer on Death (TOD) Process for Brokerage Firms  

After receiving notification of an account holder's death, the brokerage firm requests a death certificate, current court letter of appointment, stock power of attorney, affidavit of domicile, or other documents as proof of death. The required documents depend on the type of account, such as a single or joint account, whether one or both account holders are deceased, and whether the account is a trust account and the trustee or grantor is deceased.



Firms may reject documents for the following reasons:



If they are not signed in the appropriate capacity, such as by the executor, survivor, or trustee
If the forms are completed incorrectly, such as by transposing certificate numbers
If the information has been altered
If the documents are outdated or missing the necessary court seal



For these reasons, a person must pay close attention when completing and submitting forms.


   Transfer on Death New Accounts  

In most cases, a new account is set up for the beneficiary, and the deceased person's securities and funds are transferred into it. Typically, no buying, selling, transferring of the account to another firm, or other activities may occur until the account is open and legal ownership has been established.



Opening a new account involves filling out an application and having the beneficiary provide the required personal information. Brokers use the information to learn about the account owner (beneficiary), meet their financial needs, and follow legal and regulatory obligations.


   Example of Transfer on Death  

Imagine an investor and active day trader with $50,000 in a margin account with their broker and stocks worth $200,000 in their brokerage account. When this investor set up these accounts, they filed a TOD form, stipulating who the assets should be transferred to upon death and in what percentages. The account owner can update this form at any time.



Assume the owner of the account is unmarried with two adult children. They leave 50% of their brokerage account and stocks to their son (named) and 50% to their daughter (named). Upon death, and after the appropriate paperwork is filed, half of the account balance and stocks will transfer to the son and the other half to the daughter.




What Does TOD Stand for?
TOD stands for transfer on death and is a legal means of ensuring specific people receive money and assets like stocks and bonds from brokerage accounts if the account owner dies. This is a straightforward and simple process. It involves filing a form naming the persons or people the account owner wishes to receive the assets. When the owner dies, the assets are transferred upon verification of death and identity.




What Is the Difference Between TOD and Beneficiary?
A transfer on death is an instrument that transfers ownership of specific accounts and assets to someone. A beneficiary is someone that is named to receive something of value.




What's the Difference Between TOD and POD?
A payable on death (POD) designation is an arrangement between a bank and a client that designates beneficiaries to receive assets after the client's death, without going through probate. A POD designation is usually associated with bank accounts and certificates of deposit, while a TOD is used for stocks, bonds, deeds, and similar assets.




Are TOD Accounts Taxable to the Beneficiary?
While a transfer on death designation can help avoid the probate process, the assets are still subject to applicable estate taxes, capital gains taxes, and inheritance taxes.




What Are the Disdvantages of a TOD?
One consideration to keep in mind with TOD accounts is that the assets are still considered part of the estate of the deceased. That means that creditors can seek to have debts repaid before beneficiaries have access to the assets.


   The Bottom Line  

A transfer on death, or TOD, is a designation that allows a creditor's assets to pass directly to their beneficiary after they die. The account owner specifies the percentage of assets each beneficiary is to receive, allowing their executor to distribute the assets without first passing through probate.
What Is a Transfer Payment?  

A transfer payment is a one-way payment to a person or organization which has given or exchanged no goods or services for it. This contrasts with a simple "payment," which in economics refers to a transfer of money in exchange for a product or service.



Generally, the phrase "transfer payment" is used to describe government payments to individuals through social programs such as welfare, student grants, and even Social Security. However, government payments to corporations—including unconditional bailouts and subsidies—are not commonly described as transfer payments.





Key Takeaways

A transfer payment is a payment of money for which there are no goods or services exchanged.Transfer payments commonly refer to efforts by local, state, and federal governments to redistribute money to those in need.In the U.S., Social Security and unemployment insurance are common types of transfer payments.Corporate bailouts and subsidies are not commonly referred to as transfer payments.


   Understanding Transfer Payments  

In the U.S., transfer payments usually refer to payments made to individuals by the federal government through various social programs. These payments are considered a redistribution of wealth from the well-compensated to the poorly compensated. They are made both for humanitarian reasons and, at times of economic distress, to help stimulate the economy by putting more money into people's hands.


   Types of Transfer Payments  

The most well-known form of transfer payment is likely Social Security payments, whether for retirement or disability. These are considered transfer payments even though most recipients have paid into the system during their working lives. Similarly, unemployment payments are also considered transfer payments.



There are many other types of transfer payments. They can be made from one person to another or even from an individual to an organization. These can include individual donations to charities or non-profit organizations, or even a simple cash gift from one person to another.



Subsidies for education and training are also considered a type of government transfer payment. This includes transfers to companies or labor groups that provide educational services or operate apprenticeship programs.



Transfer payments do not include subsidies paid to farmers, manufacturers, and exporters, even though they are a one-way payment from the government.


   Transfer Payments and the Economy  

Transfer payments are often introduced or expanded during severe economic recessions. Social Security, for example, was created by the Roosevelt administration during the Great Depression.



More recently, though less grand in scale, in March 2020 Congress voted to provide direct cash payments of $1,200 to most Americans, totaling some $250 billion, as well as additional direct assistance to U.S. workers affected by the economic collapse. (Congress also approved $500 billion in bailouts for U.S. corporations.)



Many countries provide direct cash assistance to people during economic recessions as a way to support those in need and stimulate the economy. According to Keynesian economics, there is a "multiplier effect" to transfer payments, meaning every dollar in payments stimulates a chain reaction that results in more spending than merely the original dollar.
What Is Transfer Price?  

Transfer price, also known as transfer cost, is the price at which related parties transact with each other, such as during the trade of supplies or labor between departments. Transfer prices may be used in transactions between a company and its subsidiaries, or between divisions of the same company in different countries.





Key Takeaways

Transfer prices that differ from market value will be advantageous for one entity, while lowering the profits of the other entity.Multinational companies can manipulate transfer prices in order to shift profits to low tax regions.To remedy this, regulations enforce an arm's length transaction rule that requires pricing to be based on similar transactions done between unrelated parties.

   Understanding Transfer Price  

Transfer prices are used when individual entities of a larger multi-entity firm are treated and measured as separately run entities. It is common for multi-entity corporations to be consolidated on a financial reporting basis; however, they may report each entity separately for tax purposes.



A transfer price arises for accounting purposes when related parties, such as divisions within a company or a company and its subsidiary, report their own profits. When these related parties are required to transact with each other, a transfer price is used to determine costs. Transfer prices generally do not differ much from the market price. If the price does differ, then one of the entities is at a disadvantage and would ultimately start buying from the market to get a better price.



For example, assume entity A and entity B are two unique segments of Company ABC. Entity A builds and sells wheels, and entity B assembles and sells bicycles. Entity A may also sell wheels to entity B through an intracompany transaction. If entity A offers entity B a rate lower than market value, entity B will have a lower cost of goods sold (COGS) and higher earnings than it otherwise would have. However, doing so would also hurt entity A's sales revenue.



If, on the other hand, entity A offers entity B a rate higher than market value, then entity A would have higher sales revenue than it would have if it sold to an external customer. Entity B would have higher COGS and lower profits. In either situation, one entity benefits while the other is hurt by a transfer price that varies from market value.



Regulations on transfer pricing ensure the fairness and accuracy of transfer pricing among related entities. Regulations enforce an arm’s length transaction rule that states that companies must establish pricing based on similar transactions done between unrelated parties. It is closely monitored within a company’s financial reporting.



Transfer pricing requires strict documentation that is included in the footnotes to the financial statements for review by auditors, regulators, and investors. This documentation is closely scrutinized. If inappropriately documented, it can burden the company with added taxation or restatement fees. These prices are closely checked for accuracy to ensure that profits are booked appropriately within arm's length pricing methods and associated taxes are paid accordingly.



Transfer prices are used when divisions sell goods in intracompany transactions to divisions in other international jurisdictions. A large part of international commerce is actually done within companies as opposed to between unrelated companies. Intercompany transfers done internationally have tax advantages, which has led regulatory authorities to frown upon using transfer pricing for tax avoidance.



When transfer pricing occurs, companies can manipulate profits of goods and services, in order to book higher profits in another country that may have a lower tax rate. In some cases, the transfer of goods and services from one country to another within an intracompany transaction can also allow a company to avoid tariffs on goods and services exchanged internationally. The international tax laws are regulated by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), and auditing firms within each international location audit the financial statements accordingly.


   Transfer Price Example  

To better understand the effect of transfer pricing on taxation, let's take the example above with entity A and entity B. Assume entity A is in a high tax country, while entity B is in a low tax country. It would benefit the organization as a whole for more of Company ABC's profits to appear in entity B's division, where the company will pay lower taxes.



In that case, Company ABC may attempt to have entity A offer a transfer price lower than market value to entity B when selling them the wheels needed to build the bicycles. As explained above, entity B would then have a lower cost of goods sold (COGS) and higher earnings, and entity A would have reduced sales revenue and lower total earnings.



Companies will attempt to shift a major part of such economic activity to low-cost destinations to save on taxes. This practice continues to be a major point of discord between the various multinational companies and tax authorities like the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The various tax authorities each have the goal to increase taxes paid in their region, while the company has the goal to reduce overall taxes.




Why Is Transfer Price Used?
Transfer prices are used when individual entities of a larger multi-entity firm are treated and measured as separately run entities. While it is common for multi-entity corporations to be consolidated on a financial reporting basis, they may report each entity separately for tax purposes. When these entities report their own profits a transfer price may be necessary for accounting purposes to determine the costs of the transactions. 




What Are the Benefits of Transfer Pricing?
Transfer prices will usually be equal to or lower than market prices which will result in cost savings for the entity buying the product or service. It increases transparency in intra-entity transactions. Finally, the desired product is readily available so supply chain issues can be mitigated.




What Are the Disadvantages of Transfer Pricing?
Since transfer prices are usually equal to, or lower than, market prices, the entity selling the product is liable to get less revenue. There is also the fact that it is a complicated process. Market prices are based on supply-demand relationships, whereas transfer prices may be subject to other organizational forces. Additionally, intra-entity animosity might arise, especially if the transfer price is appreciably higher or lower than the market price as one of the parties will feel cheated.
What Is Transfer Pricing?  

Transfer pricing is an accounting practice that represents the price that one division in a company charges another division for goods and services provided.



Transfer pricing allows for the establishment of prices for the goods and services exchanged between subsidiaries, affiliates, or commonly controlled companies that are part of the same larger enterprise. Transfer pricing can lead to tax savings for corporations, though tax authorities may contest their claims.





Key Takeaways

Transfer pricing accounting occurs when goods or services are exchanged between divisions of the same company.A transfer price is based on market prices in charging another division, subsidiary, or holding company for services rendered.Companies use transfer pricing to reduce the overall tax burden of the parent company.Companies charge a higher price to divisions in high-tax countries (reducing profit) while charging a lower price (increasing profits) for divisions in low-tax countries.The IRS states that transfer pricing should be the same between intercompany transactions as it would have been had the company done the transaction outside the company.


   How Transfer Pricing Works  

Transfer pricing is an accounting and taxation practice that allows for pricing transactions internally within businesses and between subsidiaries that operate under common control or ownership. The transfer pricing practice extends to cross-border transactions as well as domestic ones.



A transfer price is used to determine the cost to charge another division, subsidiary, or holding company for services rendered. Typically, transfer prices are reflective of the going market price for that good or service. Transfer pricing can also be applied to intellectual property such as research, patents, and royalties.



Multinational corporations (MNCs) are legally allowed to use the transfer pricing method to allocate earnings among their subsidiary and affiliate companies that are part of the parent organization. However, companies sometimes can also use (or misuse) this practice by altering their taxable income, thus reducing their overall taxes. The transfer pricing mechanism is a way that companies can shift tax liabilities to low-cost tax jurisdictions.


   Transfer Pricing and Taxes  

To better understand how transfer pricing impacts a company's tax bill, let's consider the following scenario. Let's say that an automobile manufacturer has two divisions: Division A, which manufactures software, and Division B, which manufactures cars. Division A sells the software to other carmakers as well as its parent company. Division B pays Division A for the software, typically at the prevailing market price that Division A charges other carmakers.



Let's say that Division A decides to charge a lower price to Division B instead of using the market price. As a result, Division A's sales or revenues are lower because of the lower pricing. On the other hand, Division B's costs of goods sold (COGS) are lower, increasing the division's profits. In short, Division A's revenues are lower by the same amount as Division B's cost savings—so there's no financial impact on the overall corporation.



However, let's say that Division A is in a higher tax country than Division B. The overall company can save on taxes by making Division A less profitable and Division B more profitable. By making Division A charge lower prices and pass those savings on to Division B, boosting its profits through a lower COGS, Division B will be taxed at a lower rate. In other words, Division A's decision not to charge market pricing to Division B allows the overall company to evade taxes.



In short, by charging above or below the market price, companies can use transfer pricing to transfer profits and costs to other divisions internally to reduce their tax burden.


   Transfer Pricing and the IRS  

The IRS states that transfer pricing should be the same between intercompany transactions that would have otherwise occurred had the company done the transaction with a party or customer outside the company. According to the IRS website, transfer pricing is defined as follows:



The regulations under section 482 generally provide that prices charged by one affiliate to another, in an intercompany transaction involving the transfer of goods, services, or intangibles, yield results that are consistent with the results that would have been realized if uncontrolled taxpayers had engaged in the same transaction under the same circumstances.



As a result, the financial reporting of transfer pricing has strict guidelines and is closely watched by tax authorities. Auditors and regulators often require extensive documentation. If the transfer value is done incorrectly or inappropriately, the financial statements may need to be restated, and fees or penalties could be applied.



However, there is much debate and ambiguity surrounding how transfer pricing between divisions should be accounted for and which division should take the brunt of the tax burden.






Tax authorities have strict rules regarding transfer pricing to discourage companies from using it to avoid taxes.


   Examples of Transfer Pricing  

A few prominent cases remain a matter of contention between tax authorities and the companies involved.


  Coca-Cola  

Because the production, marketing, and sales of Coca-Cola Co. (KO) are concentrated in various overseas markets, the company continues to defend its $3.3 billion transfer pricing of a royalty agreement. The company transferred IP value to subsidiaries in Africa, Europe, and South America between 2007 and 2009. The IRS and Coca-Cola continue to battle through litigation, and the case has yet to be resolved.


  Medtronic  

Ireland-based medical device maker Medtronic and the IRS met in court between June 14 and June 25, 2021, to try and settle a dispute worth $1.4 billion. Medtronic is accused of transferring intellectual property to low-tax havens globally. The transfer involves the value of intangible assets between Medtronic and its Puerto Rican manufacturing affiliate for the tax years 2005 and 2006. The court had initially sided with Medtronic, but the IRS filed an appeal. In mid-2022, the court found that Medtronic did not meet its burden of proof requirement, and the IRS abused its discretion by modifying the method it proposed Medtronic used.




What Are Commonly Used Methods of Transfer Pricing?
The Comparable Uncontrolled Price Method is one of the most commonly used transfer pricing methods.




What Are the Disadvantages of Transfer Pricing?
One of the key disadvantages is that the seller is at risk of selling for less, netting them less revenue. The practice also give multinational corporations a tax loophole.




What Is the Purpose for Transfer Pricing?
Transfer pricing acts to distribute earnings throughout an organization but is primarily used to skirt tax laws and reduce tax burdens by multinational companies.


   The Bottom Line  

Transfer pricing is a legal technique used by large businesses to move profits around from parent companies to subsidiaries and affiliates to ensure funds are evenly distributed. However, many multinational corporations use it as a tactic to lower their tax burdens and end up fighting the IRS in court.
What Is a Transfer Tax?  

A transfer tax is a charge levied on the transfer of ownership or title to property from one individual or entity to another. A transfer tax may be imposed by a state, county, or municipality. It is usually not deductible from federal or state income taxes, although it may be added to the cost basis when profit on the sale of securities and investment property is calculated. Transfer tax is considered an excise tax in some states.





Key Takeaways

A transfer tax is charged by a state or local government to complete a sale of property from one owner to another.The tax is typically based on the value of the property.A federal or state inheritance tax or estate tax may be considered a type of transfer tax.


   Understanding a Transfer Tax  

A transfer tax on real estate may be imposed by state, county, or municipal authorities for the privilege of transferring real property within the jurisdiction. The government is effectively taxing the transfer of a legal deed, certificate, or title from a seller to a buyer. The amount of the tax is based on the property value and the property classification.



The seller is liable for the real estate transfer tax, although it is not uncommon for an agreement to be reached for the buyer to pay the tax. Some states require that the buyer pay the tax if the seller does not pay it or is exempt from paying it.



Some states do not impose a transfer tax on real estate. They include Alaska, Arizona, Idaho, Indiana, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oregon, Texas, Utah, and Wyoming.


   Transfer Taxes on Inheritances  

A transfer tax may also be imposed on the transfer of property by inheritance. This is sometimes called a death tax, particularly by opponents of inheritance taxes.



A death tax may refer to any gift tax, estate tax, or generation-skipping transfer tax that is imposed on the value of property inherited after the death of the owner.






Exclusions for inheriting estates worth less than millions protect most Americans from owing estate taxes.



In recent years, all but the wealthiest Americans have been protected from these taxes by high dollar-amount exemptions at the federal level.



The federal estate tax applies to a decedent’s gross estate, which generally includes all of the person's financial and real assets. For taxpayers inheriting in 2022, the exclusion amount is $12.06 million ($12.92 million for 2023).



There is also a gift tax that applies to transfers of money or property made while a person is living. The federal gift tax ranges applies to the giver of a gift, not the recipient, for amounts above $16,000 for 2022 and $17,000 for 2023.


   The Generation-Skipping Transfer Tax  

The generation-skipping transfer (GST) tax is an additional tax on a transfer of title to a property that skips a generation. The GST tax was implemented to prevent families from avoiding the estate tax for one or more generations by making their gifts or bequests directly to their grandchildren or great-grandchildren rather than to their children.



The same exclusions apply to the GST: The transfer must be worth more than $12.06 million in 2022 ($12.92 million in 2023) for the tax to kick in.


   State Transfer Taxes  

Sixteen states and the District of Columbia have either an estate tax or an inheritance tax, and one state has both. An estate tax is levied against the assets of the deceased, while an inheritance tax is owed by the recipient of the assets.
What Is a Transferable Letter of Credit?  

A transferable letter of credit is a letter of credit that allows the first beneficiary to transfer some or all of the credit to another party, creating a secondary beneficiary. The party that initially accepts the transferable letter of credit from the bank is referred to as the first, or primary, beneficiary, while the party that applied for the letter of credit is the applicant. A transferable letter of credit is often used in business deals to ensure payment to a supplier or manufacturer and is an alternative to making an advance payment.





Key Takeaways

A transferable letter of credit permits an initial beneficiary to transfer some or all of the credit they are due to another party. Transferable letters of credit are used in certain business deals to ensure that payment is made to a supplier or manufacturer.The parties involved in a transferable letter of credit, in addition to the bank, are the applicant (the buyer of goods or services), the first beneficiary (such as a retailer or broker), and the second beneficiary (such as a supplier or manufacturer).


   How Transferable Letters of Credit Work  

A letter of credit is a document provided by a bank, guaranteeing that a seller will receive the money a buyer has promised to pay it for goods or services in a particular transaction. If the buyer fails to do so, the bank can become responsible for paying.



For example, sellers of manufactured goods often require a letter of credit guaranteeing that they will receive the money they are due—on time and for the full, correct amount—before proceeding to fill a customer's order. The buyer applies to a bank to obtain the letter of credit and pays a fee to compensate the bank for the risk it is taking.



Letters of credit are often used in transactions between importers and exporters. As the U.S. Department of Commerce explains, "Letters of credit (LCs) are one of the most secure instruments available to international traders.... An LC is useful when reliable credit information about a foreign buyer is difficult to obtain, but the exporter is satisfied with the creditworthiness of the buyer's foreign bank. An LC also protects the buyer since no payment obligation arises until the goods have been shipped as promised."



A transferable letter of credit includes an additional provision making some or all of the credit that the bank is guaranteeing transferable to another party, known as the secondary beneficiary. The secondary beneficiary might, for example, be a supplier that the seller (the first beneficiary) is relying on to provide the goods that they are selling. In this type of arrangement, the first beneficiary is serving as a sort of middleman between the supplier and the buyer. There can be more than one secondary beneficiary.



Transferable letters of credit, like other credit letters, are used in both domestic and international commerce.


   Obtaining a Transferable Letter of Credit  

Letters of credit are available from many banks, particularly those with an international presence.



The approval process for letters of credit, both transferable and non-transferable, is similar to applying for a bank loan. The buyer must submit a credit application, including details on their income, assets, and existing debts, as well as the transaction itself. The bank will analyze that information as part of its underwriting process. Underwriting is the procedure banks follow to assess how much risk a particular borrower poses and make a decision on whether to extend them credit—and, if so, at what cost.



With a letter of credit, the borrower isn't taking an actual loan. Instead, the letter of credit guarantees that the bank is willing to issue a loan for a specified amount to the borrower if one is needed to cover the payment promised to the seller.


   Transferable Letter of Credit vs. Confirmed Letter of Credit  

A transferable letter of credit can be a more convenient option for a buyer than a confirmed letter of credit. That's because the buyer is only required to deal with one bank for a transferable letter of credit.



With a confirmed letter of credit, however, the buyer must obtain two letters of credit, with the second letter guaranteeing the first one. Confirmed letters of credit can be required by a seller in the event that the first bank defaults on repayment. The second bank will typically be a bank that the seller is familiar with. Confirmed letters are common in international trade and may involve banks in more than one country.




What Is a Commercial Letter of Credit?
With a commercial letter of credit, the bank makes payment directly to the beneficiary (typically the seller in a transaction) by releasing the buyer's funds when the beneficiary has fulfilled its obligations. This contrasts with a standby letters of credit, in which the bank pays the seller directly only if the buyer fails to do so.




What Is a Back-to-Back Letter of Credit?
A back-to-back letter of credit refers to two separate letters of credit issued for the same transaction when a middleman is involved. The buyer will provide a letter of credit to the middleman (such as a re-seller or broker), assuring them that they'll be paid. Based on the first letter, the middleman can then provide a separate letter of credit to their supplier (such as a manufacturer). The two letters ensure that all parties get paid.




What Is a Revolving Letter of Credit?
A revolving letter of credit is one that provides a sum of credit that can be used over a series of transactions. It is often useful when a buyer and seller (such as an importer and an exporter) have an ongoing relationship. With a revolving letter of credit, the buyer doesn't have to get a new letter of credit each time.




What Is a Credit Facility?
A credit facility refers to a loan made to a borrower who can then access the funds as needed rather than all at once. Revolving credit is one example of a credit facility.




What Does a Letter of Credit Cost?
Banks typically charge a percentage of the amount of money they are guaranteeing for a letter of credit, but the fee can also vary based on the applicant's creditworthiness. A review of lender websites shows fees generally ranging from about 0.75% to 2%.


   The Bottom Line  

Letters of credit are an important tool in business transactions between buyers and sellers, especially if the parties are in different countries or have not had a long relationship and built up trust. Transferable letters assure both sellers and their suppliers that they will be paid for their goods and services if they deliver as promised. Buyers must pay for letters of credit, but they often facilitate deals that wouldn't be possible otherwise.
What Is Translation Exposure?  

Translation exposure (also known as translation risk) is the risk that a company's equities, assets, liabilities, or income will change in value as a result of exchange rate changes. This occurs when a firm denominates a portion of its equities, assets, liabilities, or income in a foreign currency. It is also known as "accounting exposure.”



Accountants use various methods to insulate firms from these types of risks, such as consolidation techniques for the firm's financial statements and using the most effective cost accounting evaluation procedures. In many cases, translation exposure is recorded in financial statements as an exchange rate gain (or loss).





Key Takeaways

Translation exposure (also known as translation risk) is the risk that a company's equities, assets, liabilities, or income will change in value as a result of exchange rate changes.When a firm denominates a portion of its equities, assets, liabilities, or income in a foreign currency, translation risk occurs. "Accounting exposure” means the same thing as translation risk.Translation risk can lead to what appears to be a financial gain or loss that is not a result of a change in assets, but in the current value of the assets based on exchange rate fluctuations.


   Understanding Translation Exposure  

Translation exposure is most evident in multinational organizations since a portion of their operations and assets will be based in a foreign currency. It can also affect companies that produce goods or services that are sold in foreign markets even if they have no other business dealings within that country.



In order to properly report the organization's financial situation, the assets and liabilities for the whole company need to be adjusted into the home currency. Since an exchange rate can vary dramatically in a short period of time, this unknown, or risk, creates translation exposure. This risk is present whether the change in the exchange rate results in an increase or decrease of an asset's value.



Translation risk can lead to what appears to be a financial gain or loss that is not a result of a change in assets, but in the current value of the assets based on exchange rate fluctuations. For example, should a company be in possession of a facility located in Germany worth €1 million and the current dollar-to-euro exchange rate is 1:1, then the property would be reported as a $1 million asset.



If the exchange rate changes and the dollar-to-euro ratio becomes 1:2, the asset would be reported as having a value of $500,000. This would appear as a $500,000 loss on financial statements, even though the company is in possession of the exact same asset it had before.






Translation risk can occur at any time a business operates in regions that use different currencies.


   Transaction vs. Translation Exposure  

There is a distinct difference between transaction and translation exposure. Transaction exposure involves the risk that when a business transaction is arranged in a foreign currency, the value of that currency may change before the transaction is complete.



Should the foreign currency appreciate, it will cost more in the business’s home currency. Translation risk focuses on the change in a foreign-held asset’s value based on a change in exchange rate between the home and foreign currencies.


   Hedging Translation Risk  

A variety of mechanisms are in place that allow a company to use hedging to lower the risk created by translation exposure. Companies can attempt to minimize translation risk by purchasing currency swaps or hedging through futures contracts.



In addition, a company can request that clients pay for goods and services in the currency of the company's country of domicile. This way, the risk associated with local currency fluctuation is not borne by the company but instead by the client who is responsible for making the currency exchange prior to conducting business with the company.
What Is Transparency?  

Although the term transparency is not a financial term or metric per se, it has become increasingly important to consumers and investors over the last several years. 



Transparency is the extent to which investors have ready access to required financial information about a company, such as price levels, market depth, and audited financial reports. Investors also require transparency with investment firms and funds surrounding the various fees that'll be charged to them.



Transparency can also include clarity for consumers regarding the fees that bank charges or the rate that consumers will ultimately pay to their credit card company.





Key Takeaways

Transparency is the access and proper disclosure of financial information, such as a company's audited financial reports.Transparency also involves clarity with investment firms and funds surrounding the various fees that'll be charged to clients.Transparency for consumers includes proper disclosure of bank fees and the interest rate charged by credit card companies.Transparency helps reduce uncertainty and wild stock price fluctuations because all market participants can base decisions of value on the same data. Price transparency is the extent to which all information regarding a stock's price (such as its bid prices, ask prices, and trading quantities) is available to traders.


   Understanding Transparency  

Financial decisions are typically made based on an assessment of a financial situation.



Investors analyze a company's financial statements to determine if the stock is worth buying. On the other hand, consumers choose a bank or investment firm based, in part, on the costs or fees. Adequate disclosure of fees, interest rates, and penalties are important for making sound decisions as to what credit card or loan to apply for as well as what bank account to open or what mutual fund to invest in.



Because investor decisions as to what security to buy are based on a company's financial reports, the reports should be as transparent as possible.



For example, assume two companies have similar debt levels, size, market risk exposure, and earnings. One company operates with transparency concerning its financial reports while the other company runs multiple businesses with complex financial reports. Investors may gravitate to the first company since they can easily understand the company's fundamentals and risks involved. However, investors who put their money into a company with a complex structure might miss critical financial details that could lead to the company performing poorly and a loss on the investment.



As a result, it's important that transparency rules are followed by all companies. The critical nature of transparency and consistency to the financial markets is why publicly traded companies on exchanges, such as the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) are regulated.


   Required Transparency  

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is the federal government agency responsible for regulating the financial reporting for corporations.



The primary goals of the SEC are to protect investors by ensuring a fair and orderly functioning of the financial markets. The SEC requires publicly traded companies to report their quarterly financials (called a 10-Q) and their year-end financials (called a 10-K).



Companies must also file an annual report as well as interim reports such as 8Ks, which contain pertinent financial information and developments. Below are some of the financial statements required by the SEC as outlined in their Financial Reporting Manual.


  Income Statement  

The income statement shows the profit and loss of a corporation. The statement outlines the revenue on the top line. Operating expenses are listed, such as the cost of goods sold, as well as operating income. Also, other expenses include overhead or selling, general, and administrative expenses (SG&A) as well as interest expenses and taxes paid. The profit or net income is listed at the bottom of the income statement.


  Balance Sheet  

The balance sheet shows a corporation's assets, liabilities, and stockholders' equity or shareholders' equity.



Assets can include fixed assets, such as machinery or equipment, while liabilities can include short-term payables and long-term liabilities, such as debt.


  Cash Flow Statement  

The cash flow statement measures all of the cash inflows–or credits-as well as any of the cash outflows–or debits–to cash that a company experienced during the period.



The statement of cash flows also shows any investing activities, such as purchases of equipment that would help the long-term by day of the company. Financing activities are also listed, which include any cash inflows or outflows regarding the financing of the company, such as loans, bond issuance, and stock issuance.


  Statement of Stockholders' Equity  

The statement of stockholders' equity records all the changes to shareholders' equity, which occurred during that period.



These changes might include any share buybacks, stock issuance, and dividends paid out to shareholders. Dividends are typically cash payments made to investors as a reward for owning the stock. However, dividends can also be paid out as shares of stock.


  Statement of Comprehensive Income  

The statement of comprehensive income list other types of income, which can include items such as foreign exchange gains or losses, hedging, and pension activity.





Comprehensive Income Examples

Examples of comprehensive income include available-for-sale securities, financial investments, pension and retirement plans, and derivative securities.


   Importance of Transparency  

Transparency helps reduce uncertainty and wild stock price fluctuations because all market participants can base decisions of value on the same data. Companies also have a strong motivation to provide disclosure because transparency is rewarded by the stock's performance.



A strong indicator of future growth is how a business invests its money. When an investor cannot find information stating where a company invests, the investor is less likely to invest in the business. Opaque financial statements could hide a company's debt level, for example, while the business is struggling with insolvency.



Investors should be aware of the underlying investments that compose their portfolios. For example, owning a single stock means investing in one company while owning a mutual fund means investing in a basket of securities or companies. Transparency helps to shows investors how much risk is involved with buying stocks, which can aid in making more informed investment decisions.



Investors should compare their investment returns with those of related securities, benchmarks, and other asset classes to help determine how their investment is performing. If a stock, for example, is underperforming while the industry is doing well, it might be a red flag. In other words, market participants might be concerned about the company's financial situation, revenue outlook, debt load, or the ability of management to run the company effectively.



Investing limitations, such as liquidity restrictions—meaning it's difficult to readily buy and sell shares—as well as the fee structure for funds and investments, should be made available.


   Example of Transparency  

In February 2016, six groups at a Tyson shareholder meeting spoke with the chair of the board John Tyson about the lack of transparency the company provided on its financial reports.



The International Brotherhood of Teamsters noted that contributions to the American Beef Federation, the National Chicken Council, and state and local lobbying efforts were not readily available. Multiple shareholders noted that Tyson's chemical spill of acidic wastewater in Monett, Missouri killed over 100,000 fish in the city's waterways.



Shareholders wanted more information on the company's planned improvement of water quality in plant areas. Additionally, shareholders asked for an annual report showing plant safety records to ensure the records improve over time. Tyson's family members controlled the company's voting rights and did not approve of what was being asked of them. As a result, all six proposals were voted down.



However, Tyson Foods was later fined $2 million in early 2018 by the U.S. Justice Department as originally reported by the Associated Press. As part of the settlement, the company was required to hire an independent auditor to review their environmental compliance procedures, conduct training, and make improvements to their poultry facilities.


   The Bottom Line  

As investors, we base our investment decisions largely on the financial statements that each company provides. Therefore, it's crucial to stick with companies that are transparent about their financial reporting and avoid ones that obfuscate the numbers.



If management isn't transparent, it's virtually impossible for investors to be sure about that company's real risk/reward tradeoff.


   Transparency FAQs  
  What Is Corporate Transparency?  

Corporate transparency is simply the extent to which a company's actions, financial statements, strategy, and other issues are visible to outside observers.


  What Is Price Transparency?  

Price transparency is the extent to which all information regarding a stock's price (such as its bid prices, ask prices, and trading quantities) is available to traders.


  What Does Transparency Mean in Blockchain?  

In the world of blockchain, transparency is an especially important concept. Because of the decentralized nature of Bitcoin's blockchain, for example, all transactions can be viewed on a public ledger. This makes it difficult for hackers to extract Bitcoins without being traced.


  What Does Transparency Mean in Government?  

Government transparency is the extent to which a given government prioritizes honesty and access to information in order to allow for effective public oversight. Transparency is often seen as a major tool for citizens to hold public officials accountable and to combat corruption.


  What Is Workplace Transparency?  

Workplace transparency is the extent to which managers and employees of a particular company value openness, communication, and honesty in the workplace.
What Is the Transportation Sector?  

The transportation sector is a category of companies that provide services to move people or goods, as well as transportation infrastructure. Technically, transportation is a sub-group of the industrials sector according to the Global Industry Classification Standard (GICS). The transportation sector consists of several industries including air freight and logistics, airlines, marine, road and rail, and transportation infrastructure. These industries are further broken down into the sub-industries air freight and logistics, airlines, marine, railroads, trucking, airport services, highways and rail tracks, and marine ports and services.





Key Takeaways

The transportation sector is an important industry sector in the economy that deals with the movement of people and products.These include companies such as airlines, trucking, railroads, shipping, and logistics firms, as well as those that provide transportation infrastructure.The Dow Jones Transportation Index (DJTA) was the U.S.'s first stock market index, and still tracks 20 of the most important companies in the sector.


   Understanding the Transportation Sector  

The performance of companies in the transportation industry is highly sensitive to fluctuations in company earnings and the price of transportation services. Main factors affecting company earnings include fuel costs, labor costs, demand for services, geopolitical events, and government regulation. Many of these factors are interconnected. For example, if the U.S. government passes regulations that make it more difficult for people to earn their commercial drivers' license, this will reduce the supply of drivers, driving up the cost of hiring drivers.



Oil prices are a key factor for transportation, as the commodity’s price generally has an influence on transportation expenses. Gas and fuel prices that rise will increase costs for a trucking company, eating into their profit and potentially reducing their stock price.



Energy costs and the value of transportation stocks are certainly interrelated. Low energy costs may become a factor in boosting the share price of various transportation companies, but the influence can also be reversed. When demand for transportation services is high the impact will be reflected in quarterly reports of transportation companies. This information may, once disseminated, may motivate energy traders to bid up prices for oil and similar commodities. However, if demand for commercial transportation falls, this information could lead to a decline in oil prices as well.


   Investing in the Transportation Sector  

You can invest in companies that move people and products by buying shares of individual transportation companies, or through sector-specific mutual funds or exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that specialize in the transportation sector. The transportation sector is one of the most broadly diversified with industrial companies representing airlines, railroads, truckers, equipment and leasing stocks, and logistics companies. Funds that track this sector will track a benchmark sector index like the DJTA.


  The Dow Jones Transportation Index  

The Dow Jones Transportation Average (DJTA) is a price-weighted average of 20 transportation stocks traded in the United States. The DJTA is, in fact, the oldest U.S. stock index, first compiled in 1884 by Charles Dow, co-founder of Dow Jones & Company. The index initially consisted of nine railroad companies, a testament to their dominance of the U.S. transportation sector in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and two non-railroad companies. In addition to railroads, the index now includes airlines, trucking, marine transportation, delivery services and logistics companies.

What Is a Transposition Error?  

A transposition error describes an event where a bookkeeper accidentally reverses two adjacent digits, when recording transactional data. Although this error may seem small in scale, it often results in substantial financial incongruities that can have a great impact in other areas. Transpositional errors, which tend to occur in accounting firms, brokerages, and other financial services providers, fall under the broader category of transcription errors.





Key Takeaways

A transposition error is a data entry snafu that occurs when two digits are accidentally reversed.These mistakes are caused by human error.Though seemingly small in scope, transposition errors can result in significant financial consequences.If a business’ accounting records show a discrepancy, the difference between the correct amount and the incorrectly-entered amount will be evenly divisible by 9.


   Understanding Transpositional Errors  

Transposition errors are generally the result of human error. For example, in accounting, when a bookkeeper manually enters data into a ledger, they may, by mistake, incorrectly transfer information from an invoice into a balance sheet. Transposition errors may also occur when checks are filled out incorrectly, resulting in improper payment amounts that can cause overdrafts and other banking issues. Furthermore, transportation errors can result in incorrectly-recorded phone numbers, street addresses, or ZIP codes in customer profiles. And although the aforementioned mistakes are typically easily remedied, in some cases, transposition errors relating to medicinal dosing information may lead to tragic consequences.


   Examples of Transposition Errors  

If a company fails to catch and correct transposition errors, the incorrect value of assets may be perpetuated to outside agencies and individuals, such as corporate shareholders and the Internal Revenue Service. This could cause a chain effect of inaccuracies. For example, a business may be saddled with an increased tax liability if the transposition error is large enough to slingshot that company into a higher tax bracket. Of course, this largely depends on the degree of error in question. If a bookkeeper mistakenly writes $24.74 instead of $24.47, the resulting $0.27 discrepancy would hardly be consequential. On the other hand, if $1,823,000 were accidentally recorded as $1,283,000, the resulting $540,000 error is sure to have a profound financial ripple effect.






Transposition errors made in the trading world are sometimes called "fat-finger trades." In one famous example, a Japanese trader accidentally ordered 1.9 billion shares in Toyota. Luckily, that order never went through.


  Identifying Transposition Errors  

Interestingly, transposition errors may be revealed by a rather peculiar mathematical phenomenon. Pointedly: the difference between the incorrectly-recorded amount and the correct amount will always be evenly divisible by 9. For example, if a bookkeeper errantly writes 72 instead of 27, this would result in an error of 45, which may be evenly divided by 9, to give us 5. Likewise, if a bookkeeper mistakenly records 63 instead of 36, the difference between those two figures (27) may be evenly divided by 9 to give us 3. Bank tellers can use this rule to detect errors.






Transposition errors also describe scenarios where bookkeepers enter spreadsheet data into the wrong cells.
What Is a Traunch?  

A traunch is one of a series of payments to be paid out over a specified period, subject to certain performance metrics being achieved. It is commonly used in venture capital (VC) circles to refer to the fundraising rounds used to fund startup companies.



The term "traunch" is based on the French word "tranche," meaning "slice." The term tranche is also used in the context of securitization, as with mortgage-backed securities (MBS).





Key Takeaways

A traunch is one of a series of investments that are made subject to performance targets being met.It is used in the context of VC investing and is intended to reduce investors' risk.Traunched investments can prove difficult for entrepreneurs by reducing their flexibility and tightening the time available for them to grow their business.


   Understanding Traunches  

One of the ways that investors seek to mitigate the risks of investing in startup companies is by parceling their capital contributions into separate traunches. For example, a startup company might wish to receive $5 million in financing. Rather than rendering the full amount upfront, the investor might offer a deal in which the $5 million is split into two traunches—$2.5 million today and the remaining $2.5 million paid at a future date, subject to certain performance milestones being achieved.



From the investor's perspective, dividing an investment into traunches helps reduce risk by allowing the investor to withhold some of the planned funding unless the company demonstrates progress in its business plan. This can include performance targets relating to product development, revenue targets, additional fundraising, or other such goals. Typically, companies have little time in which to achieve the targets set out in each traunch, which is a challenge incurred by the early startup process.


  Difficulty for Startups  

Of course, this reduced flexibility can make things difficult for the startup company in a variety of ways. When hiring, obtaining only a limited amount of the invested capital can make it difficult for the company to attract the personnel it needs to efficiently develop its offering. Moreover, even when candidates are hired, the lack of clear funding can make it difficult to retain those candidates.



Traunch investments can also produce a misalignment of incentives between the investor and the entrepreneur. From the entrepreneur's perspective, it may be tempting to avoid communicating with the investor about problems facing the business—especially when those problems might cause the next traunch to go unpaid. Similarly, the traunch structure can incentivize entrepreneurs to manipulate their performance figures and otherwise mislead investors into believing they are making steady progress toward their mandated goals.



More broadly, they can make it difficult for the entrepreneur to adapt their business model to meet new opportunities and avoid unforeseen risks. After all, there is no guarantee that the performance goals chosen at the onset of the investment will remain relevant over the following years. In this sense, the traunch structure can compel entrepreneurs to prioritize relatively unimportant milestones when other, more important opportunities might present themselves.


   Real-World Example of a Traunch  

Suppose you are the founder of a startup company that recently agreed to a traunched investment. Under the terms of the financing agreement, your company will receive $1 million today, $2 million in 12 months, and an additional $7 million in 24 months.



To secure these later rounds of funding, you must meet certain goals. Within the next 12 months, you must hire for a range of positions. By 24 months, you must generate at least $500,000 in revenue. Failure to meet these targets means you will forfeit the next traunch of funding.



Though you agree to these terms, you are concerned that you may struggle to meet them. You wonder if the staff you need to hire will be dissuaded from joining the company considering that you will be unable to guarantee their role for more than 12 months at the start. Similarly, you anticipate that it will be challenging to attract the customers and partnership agreements necessary to achieve your revenue goal. 



Given that your company's long-term prospects are in question, potential customers and partners might wish to delay signing agreements with your company until it achieves a more secure financial footing. This, in turn, could make it difficult for you to achieve your revenue goal.
What are Travel Expenses?  

For tax purposes, travel expenses are costs associated with traveling for the purpose of conducting business-related activities. Reasonable travel expenses can generally be deducted from taxable income by a business when its employees incur costs while traveling away from home specifically for business purposes. Those business purposes can include conferences or meetings.



Individual wage earners can no longer deduct unreimbursed business expenses. That deduction was one of many eliminated by the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017.



While many travel expenses can be deducted by businesses, those that are deemed unreasonable, lavish, or extravagant, or expenditures for personal purposes, may be excluded.



The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) considers employees to be traveling away from home if their business obligations require them to be away from their "tax home" (the area where their main place of business is located) for substantially longer than an ordinary workday, and they need to get sleep or rest to meet the demands of their work while away.





Key Takeaways

Travel expenses are tax deductible only if incurred for the purpose of conducting business-related activities.Only ordinary and necessary travel expenses are deductible. Expenses that are deemed unreasonable, lavish, or extravagant are not deductibleThe IRS considers employees to be traveling away from home if their business obligations require them to be away from their "tax home” substantially longer than an ordinary day's work.Examples of deductible travel expenses include airfare and lodging, transport services, cost of meals and tips, and the use of communications devices.Travel expenses incurred while on an indefinite work assignment that lasts more than one year are not deductible for tax purposes.


   Understanding Travel Expenses  

Well-organized records—such as receipts, canceled checks, and other documents that support a deduction—can help individuals get reimbursed by their employer and help their employers prepare tax returns. Examples of travel expenses can include:



Airfare and lodging for the express purpose of conducting business away from homeTransport services such as taxis, buses, or trains to the airport or to and around the travel destinationThe cost of meals and tips, dry cleaning service for clothes, and the cost of business calls during business travel away from homeThe cost of computer rental and other communications devices while on the business trip






Travel expenses do not include regular commuting fees.


   Types of Travel Expenses  

The use of one’s personal vehicle in conjunction with a business trip, including actual mileage, tolls, and parking fees, can be included as a travel expense. The cost of using rental vehicles can also be counted as a travel expenset, hough only for the business-use portion of the trip. For instance, if in the course of a business trip, a traveler visited a family member or acquaintance, the cost of driving from the hotel to visit them would not qualify for travel expense deductions.



Travel expenses incurred while on an indefinite work assignment which lasts more than one year are not deductible for tax purposes.



The IRS allows other types of ordinary and necessary expenses to be treated as related to business travel for deduction purposes. Such expenses can include transport to and from a business meal, the hiring of a public stenographer, payment for computer rental fees related to the trip, and the shipment of luggage and display materials used for business presentations.



Travel expenses can also include operating and maintaining a house trailer as part of the business trip.




Can I Deduct My Business Travel Expenses?
Business travel expenses can no longer be deducted by individuals.If you are self-employed or operate your own business, you can deduct those "ordinary and necessary" business expenses from your return.If you work for a company and are reimbursed for the costs of your business travel, your employer will deduct those costs at tax-time.




Do I Need Receipts for Travel Expenses?
Yes. Whether you're an employee claiming reimbursement from an employer or a business owner claiming a tax deduction, you need to prepare to prove your expenditures. Keep a running log of your expenses and file away the receipts as backup.




What Are Reasonable Travel Expenses?
Reasonable travel expenses, from the viewpoint of an employer or the IRS, would include transportation to and from the business destination, accommodation costs, and meal costs. Certainly, business supplies and equipment necessary to do the job away from home are reasonable. Taxis or Ubers taken during the business trip are reasonable.Unreasonable is a judgment call. The boss or the IRS might well frown upon a bill for a hotel suite instead of a room, or a sports car rental instead of a sedan.


   The Bottom Line  

Individual taxpayers need no longer fret over recordkeeping for unreimbursed travel expenses. They're no longer tax deductible by individuals, at least until 2025 when the provisions in the latest tax reform package are due to expire or be extended.



If you are self-employed or own your own business, you should keep records of your business travel expenses so that you can deduct them properly.
Whether you missed your flight to Florida, lost your bags in Berlin, or broke your ankle in Ankara, travel insurance can help remedy all kinds of travel mishap costs. Travel insurance is a type of insurance covering financial losses associated with traveling, and it can be useful protection for domestic or international travel. 





Key Takeaways

Travel insurance can be purchased online, from your tour operator, or other sources.The main categories of travel insurance include trip cancellation or interruption coverage, baggage and personal effects coverage, rental property and rental car coverage, medical coverage, and accidental death coverage.Coverage often includes 24/7 emergency services, such as replacing lost passports, cash wire assistance, and re-booking canceled flights. It's important to understand what's covered and what's not, any limitations on coverage amounts, and coverage requirements.


   What Is Travel Insurance?  

Travel insurance helps cover financial losses associated with surprise circumstances that could ruin a trip, including illness, injury, accidents, flight or other transportation delays, and other issues. This insurance costs 4%-10% of a trip's price. So, for a $10,000 trip, trip insurance could cost between $400 and $1,000.



Premiums—or the price you pay for coverage—are based on the coverage type, your age, destination, trip's cost, and more. Specialized policy riders focus on the needs of business travelers, athletes, and expatriates.





Tip

You may already have travel insurance coverage from your homeowners or renters insurance or your credit cards. Call your insurance agent to find out about your current travel coverage, and your credit card company to find out about any benefits you get when you purchase air or train tickets, rent a car, or book a hotel using the card. Many travel rewards cards come with built-in travel insurance and other travel benefits.


   How Travel Insurance Works  

Travel insurance may be sold online by travel agents, travel suppliers (airlines, cruise lines), private insurance companies, or insurance brokers when booking your flight, accommodations, or car. Travel insurance companies include AIG Travel, Berkshire Hathaway Travel Protection, Generali Global Assistance, GeoBlue, Nationwide, and more.



Typically, you'll purchase coverage shortly after initial bookings for lodging, flights or other transportation, activities, and rental cars. Some policies may require you to do so to retain full coverage. Here are some terms to know for travel insurance.


  Primary and Secondary Coverage  

If you buy travel insurance, you may have concurrent insurance coverage, meaning you're covered under more than one policy. When the travel coverage is primary, the travel insurance reimburses you first without needing to make a claim through another company—and sparing you potentially increased policy rates. If the travel insurance coverage is secondary, you'll first need to attempt to file a claim with other coverage, such as an airline (lost baggage) or your own auto insurance (damaged car).


  Coverage Requirements  

There are usually stipulations spelled out how you qualify for coverage. Your claim must fall under the types of coverage offered. For example, lost baggage insurance might include coverage for personal items, prescriptions, credit cards, and your passport or visa. You may also need to take extra steps to qualify for coverage, such as reporting the loss or theft to the police.


  Policy Coverage Limits  

This is the maximum amount you can receive for the claim. For example, you might only receive $500 per bag. You may not even receive more for expensive items such as jewelry or electronic devices. You might need to provide receipts for items over a certain amount. Without receipts, the insurer may only pay for repairs.



Some coverage might require you to pay a deductible, or flat amount, before covering the remainder of your claim up to the limit.


  Exclusions  

These are the conditions under which your coverage will not cover the loss. Each policy differs. For example, your baggage damage coverage may not cover losses caused by animals. It may exclude coverage of bicycles, hearing aids or other medical devices, keys and tickets, or seizure by a government or customs official.



Pre-existing conditions may not be covered by travel medical insurance, or may only be covered if you buy a travel insurance plan within 1-2 weeks of booking your trip.


   Comprehensive Travel Insurance  

Comprehensive travel insurance includes many types of coverage listed below, bundled into one plan. Most commonly, comprehensive travel insurance bundles a 24-hour assistance line to help find doctors or get assistance in an emergency, reimburse you for trip cancellation, interruption and delay, baggage loss or delay, and medical expense and medical evacuation coverage.



Alternatively, you can purchase each coverage type separately. This may be wise if you already have coverage through other insurance or can cover your losses in many cases.


   Trip Cancellation or Interruption Coverage  

This insurance reimburses a traveler for some or all prepaid, nonrefundable travel expenses, and comes in the following forms:



Trip Cancellation: Reimburses you for paid travel expenses if you can't travel for a preapproved reason.
Travel Delay: Reimburses you for expenses if you can't travel because of a delay.
Trip Interruption: Reimburses you for travel costs if your trip is cut short.
Cancel For Any Reason (CFAR): Reimburses you for a portion of costs if you cancel the trip for any reason; typically more expensive than the other types listed above.



With most of the above, acceptable cancellation and interruption causes and reimbursement amounts vary by provider. Acceptable reasons for a claim might include the following: 



Your illnessIllness or death in your immediate familySudden business conflictsWeather-related issuesLegal obligations such as jury dutyBankruptcy



You may need to pay more or meet more requirements to file a claim for a cancellation due to financial default, terrorism in your destination city, or work reasons.





Note

When traveling, register your travel plans with the State Department through its free travel registration website, Smart Traveler Enrollment Program (STEP). The nearest embassy or consulate can contact you if there is a family, state or national emergency.


   Damage and Baggage Losses Coverage  

Baggage and personal belongings being lost, stolen, or damaged is a frequent travel problem—and can quickly ruin a trip as you must shop for replacements. Baggage and personal effects coverage protects lost, stolen, or damaged belongings during travel to, in, and from a destination.



However, many travel insurance policies pay for belongings only after you exhaust all other available claims. Baggage coverage may have many restrictions and exclusions, such as only covering up to $500 per item and $250 for each additional item. You may be able to increase or decrease amounts, shop around for coverage, or increase limits by paying more.



For example, the insurance may not pay for lost and damaged luggage due to airline fault. Most carriers, such as airlines, reimburse travelers if baggage is lost or destroyed due to the airline's error. However, there may be limitations on reimbursement amounts, so baggage and personal effects coverage provides an additional layer of protection.


   Rental Insurance  

Vacation rental insurance covers costs from accidental damage to a vacation rental property. Some plans also offer trip cancellation and interruption to help reimburse costs when you can't use your vacation rental. Some of these reasons could include the following:



Lost or stolen keysUnsanitary or unsafe vacation propertyVacation rental wasn't as advertisedThe company oversold your vacation rental



Rental car insurance covers a rental car's damage or loss while on a trip, taking the place of the rental agency's collision damage waiver (CDW) or your regular car insurance policy. Policies vary and may cover collisions, theft, vandalism, and other incidents. Rental car insurance may be a secondary policy to your own car insurance. However, it doesn't cover your liability or legal responsibility for damage or injury you cause to others.


   Travel Health Insurance  

Medical coverage can help with unexpected international medical and dental expenses, and help with locating doctors and healthcare facilities abroad. As with other policies, coverage will vary by price and provider.



Foreign travel medical coverage: These policies range from five days to one year or longer, and cover costs arising from illness and injuries while traveling.Medical Evacuation: May cover airlift travel to a medical facility and medical evacuation to receive care.



Consult with your current medical insurers before purchasing a policy to determine whether a policy extends its coverage outside the country. Most health insurance companies pay “customary and reasonable” hospital costs if you become sick or injured while traveling, but few will pay for a medical evacuation.



The U.S. government doesn't insure citizens or pay for medical expenses abroad. Before purchasing a policy, read the provisions to see what exclusions, such as preexisting medical conditions, apply. Don't assume that the new coverage mirrors that of your existing plan. Routine medical care is typically excluded unless you buy a long-term medical plan intended for expatriates, missionaries, maritime crew members, or others abroad for extended periods.





Important

Medicare or Medicaid generally don't cover medical costs overseas unless you have specific Medicare Advantage or Medigap plans covering emergency overseas care.


   Accidental Death and Dismembership (AD&D) Coverage  

If an accident results in death or serious injury, an AD&D policy pays a lump sum to surviving beneficiaries or you for an injury. The insurance usually offers three parts, providing coverage for accidents and fatalities:



Flight accident insurance: Occurring during flights on a licensed commercial airliner. Common carrier: Resulting from public transportation such as train, ferry or bus travel.General travel: Occurring at any point during a trip.



Exclusions that may apply include death caused by drug overdose or sickness. In addition, only some injuries may be covered, specifically hand, foot, limb, or eyesight. There are stated amount limits per injury.



Accidental death coverage may not be necessary if you already have a life insurance policy. However, benefits paid by your travel insurance coverage may be in addition to those paid by your life insurance policy, leaving more money to your beneficiaries. 





Tip

Review your life insurance policy before leaving home if you're concerned about the possibility of something happening to you while traveling for business or pleasure.


   Other Travel Insurance Coverage  

Depending on your plan or package selected, you may be able to add the following travel insurance types:



Identity theft resolution servicesSchool activity coverageDestination wedding coverageAdventure sports coveragePet health as a reason for cancellation or delayHunting or fishing activities as a reason for cancellation or delayMissed flight connections


   How to Get Travel Insurance  

Travel insurance varies in cost, exclusions, and coverage. Coverage is available for single, multiple, and yearly trips. To get travel insurance, you fill out an insurance company's application about your trip, including the following:



Travelers goingCostDestinationTravel datesDate of first payment toward your trip



The insurance company reviews the information using underwriting guidelines to guide issuing a policy and the rate. If it accepts your application, the company will issue a policy covering your trip. If the company rejects your application, you can apply with another insurer.



When you receive your policy, you'll typically get a 10- to 15-day review period to review the contract's fine details. If you don't like the policy, you can return it for a refund. Read through the document and ensure the plan you purchased doesn't apply too many loopholes, and that it covers:



Emergency medical care and transport back to the U.S.High enough limits to cover your costs or damagesRegions you're traveling toYour trip duration or number of tripsAll activities you plan to enjoyPreexisting conditions and people of your age



Also, read through for any exclusions. For example, types of property covered, and whether property lost or damaged by the airline is covered, and how.




Do I Need Travel Insurance?
You might consider travel insurance if you can't afford to cancel and then rebook an expensive or long trip. You might also consider travel health insurance if your health insurance doesn't cover international costs. An alternative is to book an easily cancellable vacation—look for a pay-later hotel room and car rental options, flexible cancellation terms, and the ability to rebook without a fee.




What Is Not Covered By Travel Insurance?
Review the travel insurance policy to discover exclusions. According to NAIC, common travel policy exclusions are:A traveler's pre-existing health conditionsCivil and political unrest at the traveler's destinationPregnancy and childbirthCoverage for those engaging in adventure or dangerous activities.Pandemics may also be excluded from coverage.




How Can I Get Cheap Travel Insurance?
Your homeowners or renters insurance may provide some protection for personal belongings,and airlines and cruise lines are responsible for loss and damage to your baggage during transport. Also, credit cardsmay provide automatic protection for things like delays and luggage or rental car accidents if used for deposits or other trip-related expenses.


   The Bottom Line  

The main types of travel insurance include trip cancellation or interruption coverage, baggage and personal effects coverage, medical expense coverage, and accidental death or flight accident coverage. Before buying a policy, check to see if you already have coverage through your own health or car insurance, or through a credit card.
What Is a Traveler’s Check?  

A traveler’s check (sometimes spelled "cheque") is a once-popular but now largely outmoded medium of exchange utilized as an alternative to hard currency and intended to aid tourists. The product is typically used by people on vacation in foreign countries. It offers a safe way to travel overseas without the risks associated with losing cash. The issuing party, usually a bank, provides security against lost or stolen checks.



Beginning in the late 1980s, traveler’s checks have increasingly been supplanted by credit cards and prepaid debit cards.





Key Takeaways

Traveler’s checks are a form of payment issued by financial institutions such as American Express.These paper cheques are generally used by people when traveling to foreign countries.They are purchased for set amounts and can be used to buy goods or services or be exchanged for cash.If your traveler's check is lost or stolen it can readily be replaced.Once widely used, traveler’s checks have largely been supplanted today by prepaid debit cards and credit cards.


   How Traveler’s Checks Work  

A traveler’s check is for a prepaid fixed amount and operates like cash, so a purchaser can use it to buy goods or services when traveling. A customer can also exchange a traveler’s check for cash. Major financial service institutions issue traveler’s checks, and banks and credit unions sell them, though their ranks have significantly dwindled today.






A traveler’s check is similar to a regular check because it has a unique check number or serial number. When a customer reports a check stolen or lost, the issuing company cancels that check and provides a new one. 



They come in several fixed denominations in a variety of currencies, making them a safeguard in countries with fluctuating exchange rates, and they do not have an expiration date. They are not linked to a customer’s bank account or line of credit and do not contain personally identifiable information, thus eliminating the risk of identity theft. They operate via a dual signature system. You sign them when you purchase them, and then you sign them again when you cash them, which is designed to prevent anyone other than the purchaser from using them.



Many banks, hotels, and retailers used to accept them as cash, although some banks charged fees to cash them. However, with the rising worldwide use of credit cards and prepaid debit cards—such as the Visa TravelMoney card, which offers zero liability for its unauthorized use—it is getting much harder to find institutions that will cash traveler’s checks.


   History of Traveler’s Checks  

On Jan. 1, 1772, the London Credit Exchange Company was the first business to issue traveler’s checks. In 1874 the Thomas Cook company issued circular notes that worked like traveler’s checks.



James C. Fargo, the president of the American Express Company, was a wealthy, well-known American who was unable to get checks cashed during a trip to Europe in 1890. A company employee, Marcellus F. Berry, believed that the solution for taking money overseas required a check with the signature of the bearer and devised a product for it. On July 7, 1891, Berry received copyrights for the instrument he termed the “traveler’s cheque,” and to this day American Express and Visa still use the British spelling on their products.


   Where to Get Traveler's Checks  

Companies that still issue traveler's checks today include American Express, Visa, and AAA. They often come with a 1% to 2% purchase fee. but AAA members can obtain checks without a fee at most AAA offices through a service known as Wells Fargo Foreign Currency (by and large, AAA now offers members pre-paid international Visa cards instead of paper checks).



In the U.S., they are available primarily from American Express locations. You can also buy traveler's checks online from the American Express website, but you need to be registered with an account. Visa offers traveler's checks at Citibank locations nationwide, as well as at several other banks.






American Express, Visa, and AAA are among the companies that still issue traveler’s checks.


   Where to Cash Traveler's Checks  

If you want to convert your traveler's checks into cash (instead of spending them directly), you can often deposit them normally at your bank. Many hotel or resort lobbies will also provide this service to guests at no charge. American Express also provides a service to redeem traveler's checks that they issue online to be deposited into your bank account. The redemption application online should take less than 15 minutes to complete.


   Advantages and Disadvantages of Traveler's Checks  

Traveler's checks are handy for tourists who do not want to risk losing their cash or having it stolen while abroad. Because they could be reported lost or stolen and the funds replaced, they provide peace of mind. This was particularly a concern before credit cards and ATM machines were widespread and affordable around the world for most travelers. At the same time, these paper checks are now a bit outdated and come with a fee to purchase, making them potentially more expensive and cumbersome than using plastic or electronic payments.





Pros

Replaced if lost or stolen
Widely accepted around the world
Convenient to use
They don't expire



Cons

Outmoded
Must have the physical check to use it
Incurs a fee to purchase
Limited number of issuers today





   Alternatives to Traveler's Checks  

The most obvious alternative is to use a credit or debit card issued by a bank that works worldwide and charges low or no foreign exchange fees on purchases or ATM withdrawals. If your bank doesn't allow for this, or charges high fees, then prepaid travel cards are the modern version of traveler’s checks. They allow you to get local currency from ATMs and make purchases with merchants—effectively eliminating the need for traveler’s checks.



Prepaid cards are not linked to your bank account, which prevents anybody from draining your checking account if the card gets lost or stolen—and you can’t go into debt. Credit cards offer similar (or better) protection, but you might not want to use your everyday card abroad. By using a dedicated travel card, you avoid spreading your card numbers around, which means you can be less vigilant about monitoring your accounts when you get back home. Visa and MasterCard both offer prepaid cards designed for use abroad. Those cards are available online, through travel agents, and at banks or credit unions. 



Travel cards should feature low ATM fees, technology that lets you operate like a local in foreign countries, emergency cash when you lose the card, and “zero liability” fraud protection. That said, prepaid cards can be expensive, so you need to compare fees against your other cards to decide whether or not a travel card makes sense.



For U.S. citizens living abroad for extended periods of time, maintaining checking and other bank accounts in the United States provides several advantages, and many checking accounts are friendly for foreign transactions.




Where Do You Buy Traveler's Checks?
You can buy still buy traveler's checks from American Express, Visa, and a handful of other financial institutions. To buy them, visit a location or check the website of an issuing institution. You may need a photo ID in order to set up an account.




How Do You Cash Traveler's Checks?
Many hotels, resorts, and currency traders will cash traveler's checks in exchange for local currency. However, with the rising prevalence of credit and debit cards there are fewer locations that cash traveler's checks.




What Do You Do With Traveler's Checks?
Traveler's checks are a secure way of carrying money while abroad. Many businesses in the tourism industry will cash traveler's checks, and they can also be deposited to a bank account. Because the checks can be easily replaced, they have a lower risk of theft or loss. However, traveler's checks have fallen out of favor due to the increased convenience of credit cards and prepaid debit cards.


   The Bottom Line  

Traveler's checks were once a popular way to carry money while vacationing abroad. They are sold in fixed denominations, and can be used for purchases or cashed like an ordinary check. Traveler's checks can be easily replaced, making them less risky than carrying large amounts of cash. However, they have fallen out of favor due to the convenience of using credit or debit cards.
What Is a Treasury Bill (T-Bill)?  

A Treasury bill (T-Bill) is a short-term U.S. government debt obligation backed by the Treasury Department with a maturity of one year or less. Treasury bills are usually sold in denominations of $1,000. However, some can reach a maximum denomination of $5 million in non-competitive bids. These securities are widely regarded as low-risk and secure investments.



The Treasury Department sells T-bills during auctions using a competitive and non-competitive bidding process. Non-competitive bids, also known as non-competitive tenders, have a price based on the average of all the competitive bids received.

Investopedia / Michela Buttignol


   Understanding Treasury Bills (T-Bills)  

The U.S. government issues T-bills to fund various public projects, such as the construction of schools and highways. When an investor purchases a T-bill, the U.S. government effectively writes an IOU to the investor. Thus, T-bills are considered a safe and conservative investment since the U.S. government backs them.



T-bills are generally held until the maturity date. However, some holders may wish to cash out before maturity and realize the short-term interest gains by reselling the investment in the secondary market.


  T-Bill Maturities  

T-bills can have maturities of just a few days, but the maturities listed by the Treasury are are four, eight, 13, 17, 26, and 52 weeks. When interest rates are expected to continue rising, longer maturity dates pay more than shorter dates. Conversely, if interest rates are expected to fall, longer maturity dates might have lower interest rates.






Need help differentiating between T-bills, T-notes, and T-bonds? T-bills are short-term, so you can use the mnemonic that the "bill needs to be paid soon."


  T-Bill Redemptions and Interest Earned  

T-bills are issued at a discount from the par value (also known as the face value) of the bill, meaning the purchase price is less than the face value of the bill. So, for example, a $1,000 bill might cost the investor $950.



When the bill matures, the investor is paid the face value—par value—of the bill they bought. If the face value amount exceeds the purchase price, the difference is the interest earned for the investor. T-bills do not pay regular interest payments as with a coupon bond, but a T-bill does include interest, reflected in the amount it pays when it matures.


  T-Bill Tax Considerations  

The interest income from T-bills is exempt from state and local income taxes. However, the interest income is subject to federal income tax. Investors can access the research division of the TreasuryDirect website for more tax information.


   Purchasing T-Bills  

There are two ways to buy T-bills. You can buy them directly from the government or on the secondary market through a broker.


  Buying T-Bills from TreasuryDirect  

New issues of T-bills can be purchased at auctions held by the government on the TreasuryDirect site. These are priced through a bidding process, with bidders ranging from individual investors to hedge funds, banks, and primary dealers. These purchasers may then sell the bills to other customers in the secondary market.



A competitive bid sets a price at a discount from the T-bill's par value, letting you specify the yield you wish to get from the T-bill. Noncompetitive bids auctions allow investors to submit a bid to purchase a set dollar amount of bills. The yield investors receive is based on the average auction price from all bidders.


  Buying T-Bills on the Secondary Market  

You can also buy Treasury bills through a bank or a licensed broker. Once completed, the purchase of the T-bill serves as a statement from the government that says you are owed the money you invested, according to the terms of the bid.


   Treasury Bonds vs. Treasury Notes vs. Treasury Bills  

Treasury bills are one of several types of debt issued by the U.S. Department of the Treasury. In addition to T-bills, there are also Treasury bonds and Treasury notes, each referring to different debt products. All three represent fixed-term debt over a period of time.



The main difference between these types of debt is the time to maturity. Treasury bills represent short-term obligations that mature anywhere between a few days to 52 weeks. Treasury notes are medium-term securities that take between two and 10 years to mature. Treasury bonds have the longest lifetime and mature in 30 years.


   Advantages and Disadvantages of T-Bills  

Treasury Bills are one of the safest investments available to the investor. But this safety can come at a cost. T-bills pay a fixed rate of interest, which can provide a stable income. However, if interest rates are rising, existing T-bills fall out of favor since their rates are less attractive compared to the overall market. As a result, T-bills have interest rate risk, which means there is a risk that existing bondholders might lose out on higher rates in the future.



Although T-bills have zero default risk, their returns are typically lower than corporate bonds and some certificates of deposit. Since Treasury bills don't pay periodic interest payments, they're sold at a discounted price to the face value of the bond. The gain is realized when the bond matures, which is the difference between the purchase price and the face value.



However, if they're sold early, there could be a gain or loss depending on where bond prices are trading at the time of the sale. In other words, if sold early, the sale price of the T-bill could be lower than the original purchase price.




Pros and Cons of T-Bills

Pros

Zero default risk since T-bills have a U.S. government guarantee
T-bills offer a low minimum investment requirement of $100
Interest income is exempt from state and local income taxes but subject to federal income taxes
Investors can buy and sell T-bills with ease in the secondary bond market



Cons

T-bills offer low returns compared with other debt instruments
The T-bill pays no interest payments leading up to its maturity
T-bills can inhibit cash flow for investors who require steady income
T-bills have interest rate risk, so, their rate could become less attractive in a rising-rate environment





   What Influences T-Bill Prices?  

T-bill prices fluctuate similarly to other debt securities. Many factors can influence prices, including macroeconomic conditions, monetary policy, and the overall supply and demand for Treasuries.


  Maturity Dates  

Maturity dates tend to dictate T-bill's prices. T-bills with longer maturity dates can have higher returns than those with shorter maturities when interest rates are rising. In other words, short-term T-bills might be discounted less than longer-dated T-bills when rates are rising, and when rates are dropping, they might be discounted more.


  Market Risk  

Investors' risk tolerance affects prices. For instance, T-bill prices tend to drop when other investments, such as equities, appear less risky and when the U.S. economy is expanding. Conversely, investors tend to invest in T-bills as a safe place for their money during recessions, spiking the demand for these safe products.


  The Federal Reserve  

The monetary policy set by the Federal Reserve through the federal funds target rate range also strongly impacts T-bill prices. The federal funds rate refers to the interest rate that banks charge each other for lending them money from their reserve balances on an overnight basis.



The Fed increases or decreases this rate in an effort to contract or expand the supply of money in the economy, which affects lending, inflation, purchasing power, and eventually, employment. A lower rate allows banks to have more money to lend, while a higher fed funds rate decreases the amount of money in the system.



As a result, the Fed's actions impact short-term rates, including those for T-bills. A rising federal funds rate tends to draw money away from Treasuries and into higher-yielding investments. Since the T-bill rate is fixed, investors tend to sell T-bills when the Fed is hiking rates because the T-bill rates are less attractive. Conversely, if the Fed is reducing interest rates, money flows into existing T-bills driving up prices as investors buy up the higher-yielding T-bills.

The Federal Reserve is also one of the largest purchasers of government debt securities. Buying and selling these securities is how the Fed acts to increase and decrease the money supply. When it sells its holdings, money is sent to and held by the Federal Reserve.



When it buys securities, money flows out to investors, which is then deposited into banks, spent, or invested in other types of securities. Banks then have more to lend, and consumers have more to spend. Influencing the money supply in this way helps the Fed manage inflation.






T-bill prices tend to rise when the Fed performs expansionary monetary policy by purchasing Treasuries. Conversely, T-bill prices fall when the Fed sells its debt securities.


  Inflation  

Treasuries also have to compete with inflation, which measures the pace of rising prices in the economy. Even if T-bills are the most liquid and safest debt security in the market, fewer investors tend to buy them in times when the inflation rate is higher than the T-bill return.



For example, if an investor bought a T-bill with a 2% yield while inflation was at 3%, the investor would have a net loss on the investment when measured in real terms. As a result, T-bill prices tend to fall during inflationary periods as investors sell them and opt for higher-yielding investments.


   Example of a Treasury Bill Purchase  

On May 13, 2023, the last 52-week T-bill issued by the Treasury was in April. It sold for $95.419667 per $100. If you had purchased a $1,000 52-week T-bill that day, you would have paid $954.19667, then received $1,000 on maturity. Thus, you would gain $45.80 in interest when the T-bill matured.




What Are the Maturity Terms for Treasury Bills?
U.S. Treasury bills are short-term government bonds and are issued with six terms. These consist of four-, eight-, 13-, 17-, 26-, and 52-week terms.




What Kind of Interest Payments Will I Receive If I Own a Treasury Bill?
The only interest paid will be when the bill matures. At that time, you are given the full face value. T-bills are zero-coupon bonds usually sold at a discount, and the difference between the purchase price and the par amount is your accrued interest.




How Can I Buy a Treasury Bill?
U.S. Treasury bills are auctioned on a regular schedule. You can buy T-bills from the government using the TreasuryDirect website. Registering is free, and the site functions like a brokerage account that holds your bonds. In addition to bidding on new issues, you can set up reinvestments into securities of the same type and term. For instance, you can use the proceeds from a maturing 52-week bill to buy another 52-week T-bill. Certain brokerage firms may also allow trading in U.S. Treasuries.




Where Is My Paper Hard Copy of the T-Bill I Bought?
T-bills and other government bonds are no longer issued on paper and are only available digitally through TreasuryDirect or your broker.


   The Bottom Line  

Treasury Bills, or T-bills, represent short-term debt obligations by the Treasury. Because the U.S. government backs them, they are considered extremely low-risk, although they also have relatively low returns.
What Is a Treasury Bond (T-Bond)?  

Treasury bonds (T-bonds) are government debt securities issued by the U.S. Federal government that have maturities of 20 or 30 years. T-bonds earn periodic interest until maturity, at which point the owner is also paid a par amount equal to the principal.



Treasury bonds are part of the larger category of U.S. sovereign debt known collectively as Treasuries, which are typically regarded as virtually risk-free since they are backed by the U.S. government's ability to tax its citizens.





Key Takeaways

Treasury bonds (T-bonds) are fixed-rate U.S. government debt securities with a maturity of 20 or 30 years.T-bonds pay semiannual interest payments until maturity, at which point the face value of the bond is paid to the owner.Along with Treasury bills, Treasury notes, and Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS), Treasury bonds are one of four virtually risk-free government-issued securities.


   Understanding Treasury Bonds (T-Bonds)  

Treasury bonds (T-bonds) are one of four types of debt issued by the U.S. Department of the Treasury to finance the U.S. government’s spending activities. The four types of debt are Treasury bills, Treasury notes, Treasury bonds, and Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS). These securities vary by maturity and coupon payments.



All of them are considered benchmarks to their comparable fixed-income categories because they are virtually risk-free. T-bonds are backed by the U.S. government, and the U.S. government can raise taxes and increase revenue to ensure full payments.



These investments are also considered benchmarks in their respective fixed-income categories because they offer a base risk-free rate of investment with the categories' lowest return. T-bonds have long durations, issued with maturities of 20 and 30 years.



As is true for other government bonds, T-bonds make interest payments semiannually, and the income received is only taxed at the federal level. Treasury bonds are issued at monthly online auctions held directly by the U.S. Treasury. A bond's price and its yield are determined during the auction. After that, T-bonds are traded actively in the secondary market and can be purchased through a bank or broker.



Individual investors often use T-bonds to keep a portion of their retirement savings risk-free, to provide a steady income in retirement, or to set aside savings for a child's education or other major expenses. Investors must hold their T-bonds for a minimum of 45 days before they can be sold on the secondary market.






   Treasury Bond Considerations  
  Treasury Bond Maturity Ranges  

Treasury bonds are issued with maturities of 20 or 30 years. They are issued with a minimum denomination of $100, and coupon payments on the bonds are paid semi-annually. The bonds are initially sold through an auction; the maximum purchase amount is $5 million if the bid is non-competitive (or 35% of the offering if the bid is competitive).



A competitive bid states the rate the bidder is willing to accept; it is accepted depending on how it compares with the set rate of the bond. A non-competitive bid ensures the bidder gets the bond, but they have to accept the set rate. After the auction, the bonds can be sold in the secondary market.


  The Treasury Bond Secondary Market  

There is an active secondary market for T-bonds, making the investments highly liquid. The secondary market also makes the price of T-bonds fluctuate considerably in the trading market. As such, current auction and yield rates of T-bonds dictate their pricing levels on the secondary market.



Similar to other types of bonds, T-bonds on the secondary market see prices go down when auction rates increase because the value of the bond’s future cash flows is discounted at a higher rate. Inversely, when prices increase, auction rate yields decrease.


  Treasury Bond Yields  

In the fixed-income market, T-bond yields help to form the yield curve, which includes the full range of investments offered by the U.S. government. The yield curve diagrams yield by maturity, and it is most often upward-sloping (with lower maturities offering lower rates than longer-dated maturities). However, the yield curve can become inverted when long-term rates are lower than short-term rates. An inverted yield curve can signal an upcoming recession.




What Are the Types of Treasuries?
There are three main types of U.S. Treasuries: bonds, notes, and bills. Bills mature in less than a year, notes in two to five years, and bonds in 20 or 30 years. All are backed by the full faith of the U.S. government.




How Do You Buy T-Bonds?
To buy T-bonds, you can head to Treasurydirect.gov, create an account, and purchase your bonds directly from the government on the website.




Are Treasury Bonds a Good Investment?
Whether Treasury bonds are a good investment will depend on the specific investor. Treasury bonds are considered risk-free assets, so investors with a low risk tolerance would find these assets suitable; however, because of their safety, they pay a low interest rate, limiting returns. These can be good options in a declining equities market for some investors. Additionally, though they are risk-free, Treasury bonds are susceptible to inflation risk and interest-rate risk, which could reduce the returns for an investor.


   The Bottom Line  

Treasury bonds are part of the collective of U.S. Treasuries. They are low-risk assets that investors can choose when looking for safe but low returns. Treasury bonds are also a good option for investors seeking a haven from volatile equity markets. Because Treasury bonds are backed by the full faith of the U.S. government, which has the largest and one of the most stable economies in the world, they are considered risk-free investments.
What Is TreasuryDirect?  

TreasuryDirect is the online platform through which investors can purchase federal government securities directly from the U.S. Treasury.





Key Takeaways

TreasuryDirect is the online platform through which investors can purchase federal government securities directly from the U.S. Treasury.New issues of U.S. Treasury bills, notes, bonds, savings bonds, and TIPS are all available from TreasuryDirect.TreasuryDirect saves investors from paying commissions and fees, by eliminating middlemen such as brokers and banks.To open a TreasuryDirect account, investors must have a Social Security number or EIN, a U.S. address, and a checking or savings account.


   Understanding TreasuryDirect  

TreasuryDirect sells Treasury bills, notes, bonds, Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS), and savings bonds, all of which are backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government and are used to finance the federal debt.



The TreasuryDirect website is the main portal through which the U.S. Treasury sells its securities. In effect, TreasuryDirect is the only way investors can purchase and redeem Treasury securities directly from the government in paperless electronic form. Through the website, money can be deposited from and withdrawn to personal bank accounts, and repurchase of securities can be rolled over as currently held securities mature.



The types of Treasury securities available through TreasuryDirect include:



Treasury bills
Treasury notes
Treasury bonds
Series I savings bonds
Series EE savings bonds
Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS)



The TreasuryDirect trading system eliminates banks, brokers, and dealers as middlemen, saving investors money on commissions and fees.





$100

The minimum required investment in the TreasuryDirect market



Treasury securities are sold through an auction process, which establishes a security’s rate and yield. Investors can place either competitive or non-competitive bids. Competitive bidders specify the rate, yield, or discount margin that they will accept; non-competitive bidders agree to accept the rate, yield, or discount margin that the auction establishes.



At the auction’s close, the Treasury first issues securities to all non-competitive bidders, then to competitive bidders from lowest to the highest bid, until it has issued the total amount of securities provided for by that auction. All accepted bidders receive the terms of the highest accepted offer. The minimum required investment in the TreasuryDirect market is $100.


   How to Open a TreasuryDirect Account  

To open a TreasuryDirect account, investors must have a Social Security number or Employer Identification Number (EIN), a U.S. address, a checking or savings account for transferring funds to and from a TreasuryDirect account, an email address, and a secure web browser and internet connection. Individuals, institutions, corporations, partnerships, limited liability companies (LLCs), sole proprietors, estates, and trusts can also establish TreasuryDirect accounts.






You can request the IRS or your state tax department to deposit your tax refund straight into your TreasuryDirect account and use the funds to purchase securities.



Of course, investors can still purchase Treasury securities through traditional channels, like brokerages or banks, even if they set up a TreasuryDirect account; however, financial professionals cannot buy securities for clients through the system.


   Special Considerations for Treasury Direct  

Only new issues can be bought through TreasuryDirect. Treasury securities typically follow a schedule to release these new issues, also known as on-the-run Treasuries. Treasuries issued before the most recently issued bond or note of a particular maturity are referred to as off-the-run Treasuries as they are taken off TreasuryDirect. For example, the 52-week bill is auctioned every four weeks, at which time the previously existing 52-week bills will only be available for trading in the secondary market.
What Are Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS)?  

Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) are a type of Treasury security issued by the U.S. government. TIPS are indexed to inflation to protect investors from a decline in the purchasing power of their money.



As inflation rises, rather than their yield increasing, TIPS instead adjust in price (principal amount) to maintain their real value. The interest rate on a TIPS investment is fixed at the time of issuance, but the interest payments keep up with inflation because they vary with the adjusted principal amount.





Key Takeaways

Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) are a type of Treasury bond that is indexed to an inflationary gauge to protect investors from a decline in the purchasing power of their money.The principal value of TIPS rises as inflation rises, while the interest payment varies with the adjusted principal value of the bond.The principal amount is protected since investors will never receive less than the originally invested principal.












Daniel Fishel / Investopedia


   Understanding Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS)  

The principal value of TIPS rises as inflation rises. Inflation is the pace at which prices increase throughout the U.S. economy, as measured by the Consumer Price Index (CPI). Inflation becomes an issue when there isn’t a commensurate rise in real wage growth to offset the negative effects of rising prices.



TIPS are a popular asset for protecting portfolios from inflation and profiting from it because they pay interest every six months based on a fixed rate determined at the bond’s auction. However, the interest payment amounts can vary since the rate is applied to the adjusted principal or value of the bond. If the principal amount is adjusted higher over time due to rising prices, then the interest rate will be multiplied by the increased principal amount. As a result, investors receive higher interest or coupon payments as inflation rises. Conversely, investors will receive lower interest payments if deflation occurs.



TIPS are issued with maturities of five, 10, and 30 years and are considered a low-risk investment because the U.S. government backs them. At maturity, TIPS return the adjusted principal or the original principal, whichever is greater. 



TIPS can be purchased directly from the government through the TreasuryDirect system, in $100 increments with a minimum investment of $100, and are available with the aforementioned maturities.



Some investors prefer to get TIPS through a TIPS mutual fund or exchange-traded fund (ETF). However, purchasing TIPS directly allows investors to avoid the management fees associated with mutual funds.






   TIPS’ Price Relationship to Inflation  

TIPS are important since they help combat the inflation risk that erodes the yield on fixed-rate bonds. Inflation risk is an issue because the interest rate paid on most bonds is fixed for the life of the bond. As a result, the bond’s interest payments might not keep up with inflation. For example, if prices rise by 3% and an investor’s bond pays 2%, then the investor has a net loss in real terms.



TIPS are designed to protect investors from the adverse effects of rising prices over the life of the bond. The par value—principal—increases with inflation and decreases with deflation, as measured by the CPI. As mentioned earlier, when TIPS mature, bondholders are paid the inflation-adjusted principal or original principal, whichever is greater. 



Suppose an investor owns $1,000 in TIPS at the end of the year, with a coupon rate of 1%. If there is no inflation as measured by the CPI, then the investor will receive $10 in coupon payments for that year. If inflation rises by 2%, however, then the $1,000 principal will be adjusted upward by 2% to $1,020. The coupon rate will remain the same at 1%, but it will be multiplied by the adjusted principal amount of $1,020 to arrive at an interest payment of $10.20 for the year.



Conversely, if inflation were negative—known as deflation—with prices falling 5%, then the principal would be adjusted downward to $950. The resulting interest payment would be $9.50 over the year. However, at maturity, the investor would receive no less than the principal amount invested of $1,000 or an adjusted higher principal, if applicable.



The interest payments during the life of the bond are subject to being calculated based on a lower principal amount in the event of deflation, but the investor is never at risk of losing the original principal if held to maturity. If investors sell TIPS before maturity in the secondary market, they might receive less than the initial principal.






TIPS don’t work as a short-term hedge against spikes in inflation. Their real function is to protect investors against rising living costs over the long term.


   How to Buy TIPS  

As with other Treasury securities, investors can buy TIPS directly from the U.S. government at the Treasury website TreasuryDirect.gov. This entails a somewhat complicated login process with several security layers.



You can also buy TIPS directly from your bank or broker. This may be more convenient for those investors who already have a substantial portfolio of securities at a certain financial institution.


   Advantages and Disadvantages of TIPS  

While TIPS are an attractive prospect for investors who expect high levels of inflation, they are at a disadvantage to other types of debt during periods of ordinary inflation. Below are some other considerations to keep in mind:



Lower yield: TIPS usually pay lower interest rates than other government or corporate securities, so they are not necessarily optimal for income investors. Their advantage is mainly inflation protection, but if inflation is minimal or nonexistent, then their utility decreases.
Tax considerations: Like other Treasury bonds, the interest and inflation adjustments on TIPS are exempt from state and local income taxes. However, the inflation adjustment is considered taxable income by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), even though investors don’t see that money until they sell the bond or it reaches maturity. Some investors hold TIPS in tax-deferred retirement accounts to avoid tax complications. However, it may be worth contacting a tax professional to discuss any potential tax ramifications of investing in TIPS.





Pros

The principal increases with inflation, meaning that at maturity, bondholders are paid the inflation-adjusted principal
Investors will never be paid less than their original principal when TIPS mature
Interest payments increase as inflation increases, since the rate is calculated based on the adjusted principal balance



Cons

The interest rate offered is usually lower than most fixed-income bonds that do not have an inflation adjustment
Investors might be subject to higher taxes on increased coupon payments
If inflation does not materialize while TIPS are held, then the utility of holding TIPS decreases





   Example of TIPS  

Below is a comparison of the 10-year TIPS to the 10-year Treasury note, both issued and auctioned by the U.S. Treasury Department. Treasury notes (T-notes) are intermediate-term bonds maturing in two, three, five, seven, or 10 years. They provide semiannual interest payments at fixed coupon rates.



As a historical example, on March 29, 2019, the 10-year TIPS was auctioned with an interest rate of 0.875%. On the other hand, the 10-year Treasury note was auctioned on March 15, 2019, with an interest rate of 2.625% per year.



We can see that the 10-year note pays more interest (meaning that investors will receive higher coupon payments from the 10-year note compared to the TIPS investment). However, if inflation rises, then the principal on the TIPS will increase, allowing for the coupon payments to rise, while the 10-year note is fixed for the life of the bond. Although TIPS protect against inflation, the offset is typically a lower yield than bonds with similar maturities.


   How Did TIPS Perform in 2022?  

In 2022, inflation in the United States hit highs not seen in four decades, leading many investors to flock to TIPS for protection. However, that insurance policy didn’t really go according to plan. These inflation-protecting securities fell an average of 14.2% during the course of the year, performing not much better than regular Treasuries and major equity markets.



This serves as a reminder of how TIPS work and how they are often misunderstood. When inflation soared in 2022, the Federal Reserve—as it normally does when the cost of living rockets—hiked interest rates. And steep increases in the cost of borrowing caused TIPS, like the rest of the bond market, to plummet in value, despite the extra payouts tied to inflation.



What 2022 taught many investors is that TIPS carry the same underlying interest rate risk exposure as other bonds and, therefore, are not the pure-play inflation hedge that some people may have thought they were. Many were fooled into thinking that TIPS returns are perfectly correlated to changes in inflation. Hopefully, they have learned their lesson.



TIPS are designed to protect investors against inflation over the long term rather than act as a short-term hedge against soaring prices.




How Can I Buy Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS)?
You can buy TIPS directly from the U.S. Treasury’s TreasuryDirect website, with a minimum purchase of $100. You can also typically buy them through your broker. There are also several mutual funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that invest in TIPS and other inflation-linked securities that you can buy and sell like ordinary shares of stock.




Can I Buy TIPS for My Individual Retirement Account (IRA)?
Yes. You can include TIPS and funds that hold TIPS in an individual retirement account (IRA); however, you cannot use the TreasuryDirect service to buy them directly in an IRA. Instead, you would need to rely on the broker holding your retirement account.




What Yields Do TIPS Have?
The yields on TIPS are often negative. This is because after taking into account the effects of inflation, the real yield is negative. For instance, if standard two-year Treasuries yield 1% but inflation is 2%, then the real yield is -1%.TIPS are meant to keep up with inflation, not beat inflation. Therefore, you can have a nominal yield on TIPS that is positive but a real yield that is effectively zero. Note that while the yield on TIPS may be negative, their principal value will increase with inflation, which can generate capital gains.




Why Does the Treasury Issue TIPS?
TIPS first appeared in 1997. The official reason for their appearance is that there was strong demand from the investing public for inflation-linked government securities. However, some economists have been puzzled by the government’s continued issuance of TIPS since they amount to a more expensive way to borrow than traditional Treasuries.




What Maturities Do TIPS Come in?
The original TIPS were set at 20-year maturities. In 2009, 20-year TIPS were discontinued in favor of 30-year TIPS. The U.S. Treasury currently issues five-, 10-, and 30-year TIPS.


   The Bottom Line  

TIPS are among the many types of debt securities offered by the U.S. Treasury Department. You can think of them as Treasuries with a twist—their principal value is tied to inflation to protect investors when the cost of living rises. However, they are often misunderstood.



It’s important to know that inflation protection comes at a cost, as most of these securities carry lower interest rates than other similar government bonds. Also, bear in mind that at the time of maturity, bondholders are paid the inflation-adjusted principal or original principal, whichever is greater. In other words, there’s protection in place for instances when there’s lots of deflation.



Another common misconception is that TIPS are guaranteed to do well when inflation is rising and function as a great short-term hedge when the cost of living suddenly spikes. As 2022 taught us, TIPS are bonds at the end of the day, and bond markets react badly to rising interest rates.
What Is a Treasury Note?  

A Treasury note (T-note for short) is a marketable U.S. government debt security with a fixed interest rate and a maturity between two and 10 years.



Treasury notes are available from the government with either a competitive or noncompetitive bid. With a competitive bid, investors specify the yield they want, at the risk that their bid may not be approved; with a noncompetitive bid, investors accept whatever yield is determined at auction.





Key Takeaways

A Treasury note is a U.S. government debt security with a fixed interest rate and maturity between two and 10 years. Treasury notes are available either via competitive bids, in which an investor specifies the yield, or non-competitive bids, in which the investor accepts whatever yield is determined.A Treasury note is just like a Treasury bond, except that they have differing maturities—T-bond lifespans are 20 to 30 years.


   Understanding Treasury Notes  

Issued in maturities of two, three, five, seven, and 10 years, Treasury notes are popular investments, and there is a large secondary market that adds to their liquidity.



Interest payments on the notes are made every six months until maturity. The income for interest payments is not taxable on a municipal or state level but is federally taxed, similar to a Treasury bond or a Treasury bill.



Treasury notes, bonds, and bills are all types of investments in debt issued by the U.S. Treasury. The key difference between them is their length of maturity. For example, a Treasury bond’s maturity exceeds 10 years and goes up to 30 years, making Treasury bonds the longest-dated, sovereign fixed-income security.


   Treasury Notes and Interest Rate Risk  

The longer its maturity, the higher a T-note’s exposure to interest rate risks. In addition to credit strength, a note or bond’s value is determined by its sensitivity to changes in interest rates. Most commonly, a change in rates occurs at the absolute level underneath the control of a central bank or within the shape of the yield curve.



Moreover, these fixed-income instruments possess differing levels of sensitivity to changes in rates, which means that the fall in prices occurs at various magnitudes. This sensitivity to shifts in rates is measured by duration and expressed in terms of years. Factors that are used to calculate duration include coupon, yield, present value, final maturity, and call features.



A good example of an absolute shift in interest rates occurred in December 2015, when the Federal Reserve (the Fed) raised the federal funds rate to a range 25 basis points higher. At that time, it had been in the range of 0% to 0.25% but then was changed to 0.25% to 0.50%. This increase in benchmark interest rates has had the effect of decreasing the prices of all outstanding U.S. Treasury notes and bonds.


   Special Considerations  

In addition to the benchmark interest rate, elements such as changing investors’ expectations create shifts in the yield curve, known as yield curve risk. This risk is associated with either a steepening or flattening of the yield curve, a result of altering yields among similar bonds of different maturities.



For example, in the case of a steepening curve, the spread between short- and long-term interest rates widens as the long-term rates increase more than the short-term rates. If the short term-rates were to be higher than any of the longer-term rates, it would create a condition known as an inverted yield curve.



Thus, the price of long-term notes decreases relative to short-term notes. The opposite occurs in the case of a flattening yield curve. The spread narrows and the prices of short-term notes decrease relative to long-term notes.
What Is Treasury Stock?  

Treasury stock, also known as treasury shares or reacquired stock, refers to previously outstanding stock that has been bought back from stockholders by the issuing company. The result is that the total number of outstanding shares on the open market decreases. Treasury stock remains issued but is not included in the distribution of dividends or the calculation of earnings per share (EPS).





Key Takeaways

Treasury stock is formerly outstanding stock that has been repurchased and is being held by the issuing company.Treasury stock reduces total shareholders' equity on a company's balance sheet, and it is therefore a contra equity account.The cost method and the par value method are the two methods of recording treasury stock.

   Understanding Treasury Stock  

Treasury stock is a contra equity account recorded in the shareholders' equity section of the balance sheet. Because treasury stock represents the number of shares repurchased from the open market, it reduces shareholders' equity by the amount paid for the stock.



In addition to not issuing dividends and not being included in EPS calculations, treasury shares also have no voting rights. The amount of treasury stock repurchased by a company may be limited by its nation's regulatory body. In the United States, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) governs buybacks.



Treasury stock can be retired or held for resale in the open market. Retired shares are permanently canceled and cannot be reissued later. Once retired, the shares are no longer listed as treasury stock on a company's financial statements. Non-retired treasury shares can be reissued through stock dividends, employee compensation, or capital raising.


   Recording Treasury Stock  

When a company initially issues stock, the equity section of the balance sheet is increased through a credit to the common stock and the additional paid-in capital (APIC) accounts. The common stock account reflects the par value of the shares, while the APIC account shows the excess value received over the par value. Due to double-entry bookkeeping, the offset of this journal entry is a debit to increase cash (or other asset) in the amount of the consideration received by the shareholders.



Treasury shares reduce total shareholders' equity and are generally labeled as "treasury stock" or "equity reduction." There are two methods of accounting for treasury stock: the cost method and the par value method. The cost method uses the value paid by the company during the repurchase of the shares and ignores their par value; under this method, the cost of the treasury stock is included within the stockholders' equity portion of the balance sheet. It is common for stocks to have a minimal par value, such as $1, but sell and be repurchased for much more.



Under the cost method, at the time of the share repurchase, the treasury stock account is debited to decrease total shareholders' equity. The cash account is credited to record the expenditure of company cash. If the treasury stock is later resold, the cash account is increased through a debit and the treasury stock account is decreased, increasing total shareholders' equity, through a credit. In addition, a treasury paid-in capital account is either debited or credited depending on whether the stock was resold at a loss or a gain.



Under the par value method, at the time of share repurchase, the treasury stock account is debited, to decrease total shareholders' equity, in the amount of the par value of the shares being repurchased. The common stock APIC account is also debited to decrease it by the amount originally paid in excess of par value by the shareholders. The cash account is credited in the total amount paid out by the company for the share repurchase. The net amount is included as either a debit or credit to the treasury APIC account, depending on whether the company paid more when repurchasing the stock than the shareholders did originally.


   Example of Treasury Stock  

ABC Company had originally sold 5,000 shares of common stock, with a $1 par value, for $41 per share. It therefore had $5,000 common stock (5,000 shares x $1 par value) and $200,000 common stock APIC (5,000 shares x ($41 – $1 paid in excess of par)) on its balance sheet. ABC Company has excess cash and believes its stock is trading below its intrinsic value. As a result, it decides to repurchase 1,000 shares of its stock at $50 for a total value of $50,000.



The repurchase creates a treasury stock contra equity account. Under the cash method, the treasury account would be debited for $50,000 and cash credited for $50,000. Under the par value method, treasury stock would be debited for $1,000 (1,000 shares x $1 par value), common stock APIC would be debited for $49,000 (1,000 shares x ($50 repurchase price – $1 par value)), and cash would be credited for $50,000.



In both the cash method and the par value method, the total shareholders' equity is decreased by $50,000. Assume the total sum of ABC Company's equity accounts including common stock, APIC, and retained earnings was $500,000 prior to the share buyback. The repurchase brings the total shareholders' equity down to $450,000.




What Are Retired Shares?
Retired shares are treasury shares that have been repurchased by the issuer out of the company's retained earnings and permanently canceled. While other treasury shares can be reissued or sold on the open market, retired shares cannot be reissued, they have no market value and they no longer represent a share of ownership in the issuing corporation. Retired shares will not be listed as treasury stock on a company's financial statements.




What Is the Cost Method of Accounting for Treasury Stock?
The cost method of accounting values treasury stock according to the price the company paid to repurchase the shares, as opposed to the par value. Using this method, the cost of the treasury stock is listed in the stockholders' equity portion of the balance sheet. 




What Is the Par Value Method of Accounting for Treasury Stock?
The par value method is an alternative way to value the stock acquired in a buyback. Under this method, shares are valued according to their par value at the time of repurchase. This sum is debited from the treasury stock account, to decrease total shareholders' equity. The common stock APIC account is also debited by the amount originally paid in excess of par value by the shareholders. The cash account is credited by the total cost of the share repurchase. The net amount is recorded as either a debit or a credit, depending on whether the company paid more or less than the shareholders did originally.
What Is the Treasury Stock Method?  

The treasury stock method is an approach companies use to compute the number of new shares that may potentially be created by unexercised in-the-money warrants and options, where the exercise price is less than the current share price. Additional shares obtained through the treasury stock method factor into the calculation of the diluted earnings per share (EPS). This method assumes that the proceeds a company receives from an in-the-money option exercise are used towards repurchasing common shares in the market.





Key Takeaways

The treasury stock method computes the number of new shares that may potentially be created by unexercised in-the-money warrants and options.This method assumes that the proceeds a company receives from an in-the-money option exercise are used to repurchase common shares in the market.The treasury stock method must be used by a company when calculating its diluted earnings per share (EPS).


   Understanding the Treasury Stock Method  

The treasury stock method states that the basic share count used in calculating a company's earnings per share (EPS) must be increased as a result of outstanding in-the-money options and warrants, which entitle their holders to purchase common shares at an exercise price that's below the current market price. To comply with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), the treasury stock method must be used by a company when computing its diluted EPS.



This method assumes that options and warrants are exercised at the beginning of the reporting period, and a company uses exercise proceeds to purchase common shares at the average market price during that period. The number of additional shares that must be added back to the basic share count is calculated as the difference between the assumed share count from the options and warrants exercise and the share count that could have been purchased on the open market.


   Example of Treasury Stock Method  

Consider a company that reports 100,000 basic shares outstanding, $500,000 in net income for the past year, and 10,000 in-the-money options and warrants, with an average exercise price of $50. Let's assume that the average market price for the shares in the last year was $100. Using the basic share count of the 100,000 common shares, the company's basic EPS is $5 calculated as the net income of $500,000 divided by 100,000 shares. But this number ignores the fact that 10,000 shares can be immediately issued if the in-the-money options and warrants are exercised.



Applying the treasury stock method, the company would receive $500,000 in exercise proceeds (calculated as 10,000 options and warrants times the average exercise price of $50), which it may use to repurchase 5,000 common shares on the open market at the average stock price of $100.



The additional 5,000 shares (the difference between 10,000 assumed issued shares, and 5,000 assumed repurchased shares) represent the net newly-issued shares resulting from the potential options and warrants exercise.



The diluted share count is 105,000 = 100,000 basic shares + 5,000 additional shares. The diluted EPS is then equal to $4.76 = $500,000 net income ÷ 105,000 diluted shares.






The number of additional shares that must be added back to the basic share count is calculated as the difference between the assumed share count from the options and warrants exercise and the share count that could have been purchased on the open market.
What Are Treasury STRIPS?  

Treasury STRIPS are bonds that are sold at a discount to their face value. The investor does not receive interest payments but is repaid the full face value when the bonds mature. That is, they mature "at par."



STRIPS is an acronym for Separate Trading of Registered Interest and Principal of Securities. These types of bonds are generally known as zero-coupon bonds since they pay no interest or coupon.





Key Takeaways

Treasury STRIPS are U.S. bonds that are sold at a discount to their face value and pay full face value at their maturity.STRIPS are treasury bonds where the principal and coupon payments trade as separate securities.STRIPS holders do not receive coupon payments, only the final payoff on the date of maturity.STRIPS can only be held through a financial institution or broker.Originally, only bonds longer than ten years were eligible for STRIPS, but the program has been extended to other notes or bonds.


   Understanding Treasury STRIPS  

As the acronym implies, Treasury STRIPS are created when a bond's coupons are separated from the bond. The bond, minus its coupons, is then sold to an investor at a discount price. The difference between that price and the bond's face value at maturity is the investor's profit.



The coupons become separate investments that are sold separately. Treasury STRIPS are issued by the U.S. Treasury and backed by the U.S. government. They were introduced in 1985, replacing previous zero-coupon bond issues that were known as TIGRs and CATS.



STRIPS cannot be purchased directly from the government. They can be bought by brokerages for resale to investors.


   History of STRIPS  

The first treasury STRIPS were offered in 1961, but these were not the same types of securities that are available today. These original STRIPS consisted of a package of re-opened bills maturing over a period of several weeks. They were eventually phased out in 1974.



After changes to the tax law, a new STRIPS program was initiated in 1985. This allowed bonds with a maturity greater than ten years to be divided into separate principal and coupon payments, which could be traded as separate securities. The following year, the Treasury established a facility for re-constituting principal and coupon payments into the original securities.



As the new securities proved popular on the market, eligibility was slowly expanded. In 1997, the program was expanded from only the 10-year and 30-year securities to all Treasury notes and bonds. In 2000, it was expanded to include 5-year notes that had previously been ineligible.






The first STRIPS were introduced in 1961, but they were later discontinued. The STRIPS that are available today were initiated in 1985.


   Coupon Stripping  

The process of detaching the interest payments from the bond is called coupon stripping. The coupons become separate securities, with the principal payments due at maturity. No interim coupon payments are made along the way.



For instance, a 10-year bond with a $40,000 face value and a 5% annual interest rate can be stripped. Assuming it originally pays coupons semi-annually, 21 zero-coupon bonds can be created, including 20 semi-annual coupon payments and the bond itself. Each stripped coupon has a $1,000 face value, which is the amount of each coupon. All 21 securities are distinct and are traded separately in the market.


   Advantages of Treasury STRIPS  

Like all Treasury securities, STRIPS are backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government, which is considered extremely unlikely to default. This makes them extremely attractive to investors seeking a safe investment.



STRIPS are also extremely simple instruments, with predictable costs and payoffs. Since there is a wide selection of maturity dates, an investor can simply choose the STRIP that best fits the date when they may need cash. This helps investors prepare for specific goals.



The required capital outlay is relatively small. While the minimum institutional purchase of Treasury bonds is $10,000, a STRIP based on bond interest may cost only a few hundred dollars. Moreover, they have an active secondary market, and it is fairly straightforward to invest in STRIPS through a tax-advantaged retirement account.


   STRIPS Popularity  

STRIPS are a popular choice for fixed-income investors. They have extremely high credit quality because they are backed by U.S. Treasury securities. Since STRIPS are sold at a discount, investors do not require a large stash of cash to purchase them. Assuming the STRIPS are held to maturity, their investors know the precise payouts they'll receive.






There is a robust secondary market for Treasury STRIPS, with individual STRIPS trading at market value until they reach maturity.



STRIPS also offer a range of maturity dates, since they are based on the dates of the interest payments. If an investor wishes to sell a bond prior to its maturity, the market has enough liquidity to accommodate the transaction.


   Tax Considerations  

Generally speaking, taxes are due on the interest earned each year, even though there is no cash payment until the bond reaches maturity or the STRIPS are sold.



However, this tax can be delayed with a tax-deferred account, such as an individual retirement account (IRA). Each holder of STRIPS receives a report detailing the amount of taxable interest income earned.
What Is the Treasury Yield?  

Treasury yield is the effective annual interest rate that the U.S. government pays on one of its debt obligations, expressed as a percentage. Put another way, Treasury yield is the annual return investors can expect from holding a U.S. government security with a given maturity.



Treasury yields don't just affect how much the government pays to borrow and how much investors earn by buying government bonds. They also influence the interest rates consumers and businesses pay on loans to buy real estate, vehicles, and equipment.



Treasury yields also show how investors assess the economy's prospects. The higher the yields on long-term U.S. Treasuries, the more confidence investors have in the economic outlook. But high long-term yields can also be a signal of rising inflation expectations.

   Understanding the Treasury Yield  

When the U.S. government decides to borrow funds, it issues debt instruments through the U.S. Treasury.



While bonds are a generic name for debt securities, Treasury bonds, or T-bonds, refer specifically to U.S. government bonds with maturities of 20 to 30 years. U.S. government obligations with maturities above a year and up to 10 years are known as Treasury notes. Treasury bills, or T-bills, are Treasury obligations maturing within a year.



Treasury yields are inversely related to Treasury prices. Each Treasury debt maturity trades at its own yield, an expression of price. The U.S. Treasury publishes the yields of all Treasury maturities daily on its website.









key takeaways

Treasury yields are the interest rates that the U.S. government pays to borrow money for varying periods of time.Treasury yields are inversely related to Treasury prices, and yields are often used to price and trade fixed-income securities including TreasuriesTreasury securities with different maturities have different yields; longer-term Treasury securities usually have higher yields than shorter-term ones.Treasury yields reflect investors' assessments of the economy's prospects; higher yields on long-term instruments indicate a more optimistic outlook and higher inflation expectations.


   How Treasury Yields Are Determined  

Treasuries are viewed as the lowest-risk investments because they are backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government. Investors who purchase Treasuries are lending the government money. The government, in turn, pays interest to these bondholders. The interest payments, known as coupons, represent the cost of borrowing to the government. The rate of return, or yield, that investors receive in return for lending money to the government is determined by supply and demand.



Treasury bonds and notes are issued at face value, the principal the Treasury will repay on the maturity date, and auctioned off to primary dealers based on bids specifying a minimum yield. If the price paid for these securities rises in secondary trading, the yield falls accordingly and conversely if the price paid for a bond drops the yield rises.



For example, if a 10-year T-note with a face value of $1,000 is auctioned off at a yield of 3%, a subsequent drop in its market value to $974.80 will cause the yield to rise to 3.3%, since the Treasury will still be making the $30 ($1,000 x .03) annual coupon payments as well as the $1,000 principal repayment. Conversely, if the same T-note's market value were to rise to $1,026, the effective yield for a buyer at that price will have declined to 2.7%.


   Treasury Yield Curve and the Fed  

Treasury yields can go up, sending bond prices lower, if the Federal Reserve increases its target for the federal funds rate (in other words, if it tightens monetary policy), or even if investors merely come to expect the fed funds rate to go up.



The yields on the different Treasury maturities don't all rise at the same pace in such instances. Because the fed funds rate represents the rate banks charge each other for overnight loans, it most directly affects the shortest-term Treasury maturities. The prices and yield of longer-term maturities will be more reflective of investors' longer-term expectations for economic performance. In past instances of Fed rate hikes, short-term yields have typically risen faster than longer-term ones as bonds priced in investor expectations of slowing economic growth in response to the Fed's policy.



Normally longer-term Treasury securities have higher yields than shorter-term ones. That's because the longer duration of those securities exposes them to more of a risk if interest rates rise over time. However, in advance of recessions the rate structure of Treasury yields often called the yield curve can invert. That happens when the yields on longer-term Treasuries fall below those on short-term ones as they price in investor expectations of an economic slowdown.



An inverted yield curve on which the yield on the 10-year Treasury note has declined below that on the 2-year Treasury note (to cite just one popular benchmark) has usually preceded recessions, though it has also provided a few false alarms.






When long-term Treasury yields are below short-term one, the correlation is characterized as an inverted yield curve and often seen as a precursor to an economic downturn.


   Yield on Treasury Bills  

While Treasury notes and bonds offer coupon payments to bondholders, the T-bill is similar to a zero-coupon bond that has no interest payments but is issued at a discount to par. An investor purchases the bill at a weekly auction below face value and redeems it at maturity at face value. The difference between the face value and purchase price amounts to interest earned, which can be used to calculate a Treasury bill's yield. The Treasury Department uses two methods to calculate the yield on T-bills: the discount method and the investment method.



Under the discount yield method, the return as a percent of the face value, not the purchase value, is calculated. For example, an investor purchasing 90-day T-bills with a face value of $10,000 for $9,950 will have a yield of:



Discount Yield = [(10,000 - 9,950) / 10,000] x (360/90) = 0.02, or 2% 



Under the investment yield method, the Treasury yield is calculated as a percent of the purchase price, not the face value. Following our example above, the yield under this method is:



Investment Yield = [(10,000 - $9,950) / $9,950] x (365/90) = 0.0204 rounded, or 2.04%



Note that the two methods use different numbers for days in a year. The discount method is based on 360 days, following the practice used by banks to determine short-term interest rates, and the discount yield, or rate, is how T-bills are quoted on the secondary market. The investment yield uses the number of days of a calendar year, which is 365 or 366, more accurately represents returns to the buyer, but can be used to compare the yield on the T-bill with that of a coupon security maturing on the same date.


   Yield on Treasury Notes and Bonds  

The rate of return for investors holding Treasury notes and Treasury bonds considers the coupon payments they receive semi-annually and the face value of the bond repaid at maturity. T-notes and bonds can be purchased at par, at a discount, or at a premium, depending on where the yield is at purchase relative to the yield when issued. If a Treasury is purchased at par, then its yield equals its coupon rate, or the yield at issue. If a T-bond or Treasury note is purchased at a discount to face value, the yield will be higher than coupon rate, while if it is purchased at a premium the yield will be lower than coupon rate.



The formula for calculating the Treasury yield on notes and bonds held to maturity is:



Treasury Yield = [C + ((FV - PP) / T)] ÷ [(FV + PP)/2]



where C= coupon rate



FV = face value



PP = purchase price



T = years to maturity  



The yield on a 10-year note with 3% coupon purchased at a premium for $10,300 and held to maturity is:



Treasury Yield = [$300 + (($10,000 - $10,300) / 10)] ÷ [($10,000 + $10,300) / 2] = $270 / $10,150 = .0266 rounded, or 2.66%


   The Bottom Line  

The yield of a Treasury security is the inverse of its price, and Treasuries are priced, quoted, and traded using the yield to denote the price.



Because of their relatively low risk when held to maturity, Treasuries offer a lower rate of return in comparison with most other investments. Rates on other fixed-income investments are sometimes quoted as spreads over the Treasury yield for the same maturity, with the spread compensating investors for the increased credit risk of lending to an entity other than the U.S. government.



Longer-term Treasury securities normally have higher yields than short-term ones to compensate investors for the additional duration risk--the possibility that higher interest rates will lower the bond's market value. Short-term rates in excess of longer-term ones are a sign of an inverted yield curve and can signal an economic slowdown.
What Is Treaty Reinsurance?  

Treaty reinsurance is insurance purchased by an insurance company from another insurer. The company that issues the insurance is called the cedent, who passes on all the risks of a specific class of policies to the purchasing company, which is the reinsurer.



Treaty reinsurance is one of the three main types of reinsurance contracts. The two others are facultative reinsurance and excess of loss reinsurance.





Key Takeaways

Treaty reinsurance is insurance purchased by an insurance company from another insurer.The issuing company is called the cedent, while the reinsurer is the purchasing company, which assumes the risks specified in the contract for a premium.Treaty reinsurance gives the ceding insurer more security for its equity and more stability when unusual or major events occur.The two types of treaty reinsurance contracts are proportional and non-proportional contracts.Treaty reinsurance is one type of reinsurance, the others being facultative reinsurance and excess of loss reinsurance.Treaty reinsurance is less transactional and less likely to involve risks that can be rejected.


   Understanding Treaty Reinsurance  

Treaty reinsurance represents a contract between the ceding insurance company and the reinsurer who agrees to accept the risks of a predetermined class of policies over a period of time.



When insurance companies underwrite a new policy, they agree to take on additional risk in exchange for a premium. The more policies an insurer underwrites, the more risk it assumes. One way an insurer can reduce its exposure is to cede some of the risk to a reinsurance company in exchange for a fee. Reinsurance allows the insurer to free up risk capacity and to protect itself from high severity claims.



Even though the reinsurer may not immediately underwrite each individual policy, it still agrees to cover all the risks in a treaty reinsurance contract.



By signing a treaty reinsurance contract, the reinsurer and the ceding insurance company indicate the business relationship will likely be long-term. The long-term nature of the agreement allows the reinsurer to plan out how to achieve a profit because it knows the type of risk it is taking on, and it is familiar with the ceding company.



Treaty reinsurance contracts can be both proportional and non-proportional. With proportional contracts, the reinsurer agrees to take on a specific percentage share of policies, for which it will receive that proportion of premiums. If a claim is filed, it will pay the stated percentage as well. With a non-proportional contract, however, the reinsurance company agrees to pay out claims if they exceed a specified amount during a certain period of time.


   Advantages of Treaty Reinsurance  

By covering itself against a class of predetermined risks, treaty reinsurance gives the ceding insurer more security for its equity and more stability when unusual or major events occur.



Reinsurance also allows an insurer to underwrite policies that cover a larger volume of risks without excessively raising the costs of covering its solvency margins. In fact, reinsurance makes substantial liquid assets available for insurers in case of exceptional losses.


   Treaty vs. Facultative vs. Excess of Loss Reinsurance  

Treaty reinsurance differs from facultative reinsurance. Treaty reinsurance involves a single contract covering a type of risk and does not require the reinsurance company to provide a facultative certificate each time a risk is transferred from the insurer to the reinsurer.



Facultative risk, on the other hand, allows the reinsurer to accept or reject individual risks. Moreover, it is a type of reinsurance for a single or a specific package of risks. That means both the reinsurer and the cedent agree on what risks will be covered in the agreement. These agreements are generally negotiated separately for each policy.



The expenses involved in underwriting facultative contracts are thus much more expensive than a treaty reinsurance agreement. Treaty reinsurance is less transactional and less likely to involve risks that would have otherwise been rejected from reinsurance treaties.



Excess of loss reinsurance is a non-proportional form of reinsurance. In an excess of loss contract, the reinsurer agrees to pay the total amount of losses or a certain percentage of losses above a certain limit to the cedent. Excess of loss reinsurance is less similar to standard insurance, like treaty and facultative reinsurance are, oftentimes requiring both the cedent and reinsurer to share in the losses.
What Is a Trend?  

A trend is the overall direction of a market or an asset's price. In technical analysis, trends are identified by trendlines or price action that highlight when the price is making higher swing highs and higher swing lows for an uptrend, or lower swing lows and lower swing highs for a downtrend.



Many traders opt to trade in the same direction as a trend, while contrarians seek to identify reversals or trade against the trend. Uptrends and downtrends occur in all markets, such as stocks, bonds, and futures. Trends also occur in data, such as when monthly economic data rises or falls from month to month.





Key Takeaways

A trend is the general direction of the price of a market, asset, or metric.Uptrends are marked by rising data points, such as higher swing highs and higher swing lows.Downtrends are marked by falling data points, such as lower swing lows and lower swing highs.Many traders opt to trade in the same direction as the trend, attempting to profit from a continuation of that trend.Price action, trendlines, and technical indicators are all tools that can help identify the trend and warn when it is reversing.






   How Trends Work  

Traders can identify a trend using various forms of technical analysis, including trendlines, price action, and technical indicators. For example, trendlines might show the direction of a trend while the relative strength index (RSI) is designed to show the strength of a trend at any given point in time.



An uptrend is marked by an overall increase in price. Nothing moves straight up for long, so there will always be oscillations, but the overall direction needs to be higher in order for it to be considered an uptrend. Recent swing lows should be above prior swing lows, and the same goes for swing highs. Once this structure starts to break down, the uptrend could be losing steam or reversing into a downtrend. Downtrends are composed of lower swing lows and lower swing highs.



While the trend is up, traders may assume it will continue until there is evidence that points to the contrary. Such evidence could include lower swing lows or highs, the price breaking below a trendline, or technical indicators turning bearish. While the trend is up, traders focus on buying, attempting to profit from a continued price rise.



When the trend turns down, traders focus more on selling or shorting, attempting to minimize losses or profit from the price decline. Most (not all) downtrends do reverse at some point, so as the price continues to decline, more traders begin to see the price as a bargain and step in to buy. This could lead to the emergence of an uptrend again.



Trends may also be used by investors focused on fundamental analysis. This form of analysis looks at changes in revenue, earnings, or other business or economic metrics. For example, fundamental analysts may look for trends in earnings per share and revenue growth. If earnings have grown for the past four quarters, this represents a positive trend. However, if earnings have declined for the past four quarters, it represents a negative trend.



The lack of a trend—that is, a period of time where there is little overall upward or downward progress—is called a range or trendless period.


   Using Trendlines  

A common way to identify trends is using trendlines, which connect a series of highs (downtrend) or lows (uptrend). Uptrends connect a series of higher lows, creating a support level for future price movements. Downtrends connect a series of lower highs, creating a resistance level for future price movements. In addition to support and resistance, these trendlines show the overall direction of the trend.



While trendlines do a good job of showing overall direction, they will often need to be redrawn. For example, during an uptrend, the price may fall below the trendline, yet this doesn't necessarily mean the trend is over. The price may move below the trendline and then continue rising. In such an event, the trendline may need to be redrawn to reflect the new price action.



Trendlines should not be relied on exclusively to determine the trend. Most professionals also tend to look at price action and other technical indicators to help determine if a trend is ending or not. In the example above, a drop below the trendline isn't necessarily a sell signal, but if the price also drops below a prior swing low and/or technical indicators are turning bearish, then it might be.


   Example of a Trend and Trendline  

The following chart shows a rising trendline along with an RSI reading that suggests a strong trend. While the price is oscillating, the overall progress is to the upside.



The rising trend begins to lose momentum and selling pressure kicks in. The RSI falls below 70, followed by a very large down candle that takes the price to the trendline. The move lower was confirmed the next day when the price gapped below the trendline. These signals could have been used to exit long positions as there was evidence that the trend was turning. Short trades could have also been initiated.

As the price moves lower, it starts to attract buyers interested in the lower price. Another trendline (not shown) could also be drawn along the falling price to indicate when a bounce may be coming. That trendline would be have been penetrated near the middle of February as the price made a quick v-bottom and progressed higher.
What Is Trend Analysis?  

Trend analysis is a technique used in technical analysis that attempts to predict future stock price movements based on recently observed trend data. Trend analysis uses historical data, such as price movements and trade volume, to forecast the long-term direction of market sentiment.

   Understanding Trend Analysis  

Trend analysis tries to predict a trend, such as a bull market run, and ride that trend until data suggests a trend reversal, such as a bull-to-bear market. Trend analysis is helpful because moving with trends, and not against them, will lead to profit for an investor. It is based on the idea that what has happened in the past gives traders an idea of what will happen in the future. There are three main types of trends: short-, intermediate- and long-term.



A trend is a general direction the market is taking during a specified period of time. Trends can be both upward and downward, relating to bullish and bearish markets, respectively. While there is no specified minimum amount of time required for a direction to be considered a trend, the longer the direction is maintained, the more notable the trend.



Trend analysis is the process of looking at current trends in order to predict future ones and is considered a form of comparative analysis. This can include attempting to determine whether a current market trend, such as gains in a particular market sector, is likely to continue, as well as whether a trend in one market area could result in a trend in another. Though a trend analysis may involve a large amount of data, there is no guarantee that the results will be correct.





Types of Trends to Analyze

There are three main types of market trend for analysts to consider:

Upward trend: An upward trend, also known as a bull market, is a sustained period of rising prices in a particular security or market. Upward trends are generally seen as a sign of economic strength and can be driven by factors such as strong demand, rising profits, and favorable economic conditions.
Downward trend: A downward trend, also known as a bear market, is a sustained period of falling prices in a particular security or market. Downward trends are generally seen as a sign of economic weakness and can be driven by factors such as weak demand, declining profits, and unfavorable economic conditions.
Sideways trend: A sideways trend, also known as a rangebound market, is a period of relatively stable prices in a particular security or market. Sideways trends can be characterized by a lack of clear direction, with prices fluctuating within a relatively narrow range.




   How to Perform a Trend Analysis  

In order to begin analyzing applicable data, it is necessary to first determine which market segment will be analyzed. For instance, you could focus on a particular industry, such as the automotive or pharmaceuticals sector, as well as a particular type of investment, such as the bond market.



Once the sector has been selected, it is possible to examine its general performance. This can include how the sector was affected by internal and external forces. For example, changes in a similar industry or the creation of a new governmental regulation would qualify as forces impacting the market. Analysts then take this data and attempt to predict the direction the market will take moving forward.


   Trend Trading Strategies  

Trend traders attempt to isolate and extract profit from trends. There are many different trend trading strategies using a variety of technical indicators:



Moving Averages: These strategies involve entering into long positions when a short-term moving average crosses above a long-term moving average, and entering short positions when a short-term moving average crosses below a long-term moving average.
Momentum Indicators: These strategies involve entering into long positions when a security is trending with strong momentum and exiting long positions when a security loses momentum. Often, the relative strength index (RSI) is used in these strategies.
Trendlines & Chart Patterns: These strategies involve entering long positions when a security is trending higher and placing a stop-loss below key trendline support levels. If the stock starts to reverse, the position is exited for a profit.



Indicators can simplify price information, as well as provide trend trade signals or warn of reversals. They may be used on all time frames, and have variables that can be adjusted to suit each trader's specific preferences.



Usually, it is advisable to combine indicator strategies or come up with your own guidelines, so entry and exit criteria are clearly established for trades. Each indicator can be used in more ways than outlined. If you like an indicator, research it further, and most importantly, test it out before using it to make live trades.






Trend following is a trading system based on using trend analysis and following the recommendation produced to determine which investments to make. Often, the analysis is conducted via computer analysis and modeling of relevant data and is tied to market momentum.


   Advantages and Disadvantages of Trend Analysis  
  Advantages  

Trend analysis can offer several advantages for investors and traders. It is a powerful tool for investors and traders as it can help identify opportunities for buying or selling securities, minimize risk, improve decision-making, and enhance portfolio performance.



Trend analysis can be based on a variety of data points, including financial statements, economic indicators, and market data, and there are several different methods that can be used to analyze trends, including technical analysis and fundamental analysis. By providing a deeper understanding of the factors that are driving trends in data, trend analysis can help investors and traders make more informed and confident decisions about their investments.


  Disadvantages  

Trend analysis can have some potential disadvantages as a tool for making investment decisions. One of these disadvantages is that the accuracy of the analysis depends on the quality of the data being used. If the data is incomplete, inaccurate, or otherwise flawed, the analysis may be misleading or inaccurate.



Another potential disadvantage is that trend analysis is based on historical data, which means it can only provide a limited perspective on the future. While trends in data can provide useful insights, it's important to remember that the future is not necessarily predetermined by the past, and unexpected events or changes in market conditions can disrupt trends. Trend analysis is also focused on identifying patterns in data over a given period of time, which means it may not consider other important factors that could impact the performance of a security or market.



Finally, trend analysis often relies on statistical measures to identify patterns in data, which can be subject to interpretation. Different statistical measures can yield different results, and it's important to be aware of the limitations and assumptions of the statistical methods being used.



Critics of trend analysis, and technical trading in general, argue that markets are efficient, and already price in all available information. That means that history does not necessarily need to repeat itself and that the past does not predict the future. Adherents of fundamental analysis, for example, analyze the financial condition of companies using financial statements and economic models to predict future prices. For these types of investors, day-to-day stock movements follow a random walk that cannot be interpreted as patterns or trends.




Trend Analysis Pros and Cons

Pros

Can help identify opportunities for buying or selling securities
Can identify potential risks or warning signs that a security or market may be headed for a downturn
Provides insight into market psychology and momentum



Cons

If markets are efficient, trend analysis is not as useful
If the data is incomplete, inaccurate, or otherwise flawed, the analysis may also be misleading or inaccurate
May not take into account changes in a company's management, changes in industry regulations, or other external factors that could affect the security's performance
Different statistical measures can yield different results





   Example of a Trend Analysis  

Say that an investor is considering buying shares of a particular company, and they want to use trend analysis to determine whether the stock is likely to rise in value. To conduct their analysis, the investor gathers data on the company's financial performance over the past five years, including its revenues, expenses, profits, and other key metrics. They also gather data on the overall performance of the stock market and on the company's industry.



Using this data, the investor creates charts to visualize the trends in the data. They notice that the company's revenues have been steadily increasing over the past five years, and that its profits have also been trending upward. They also notice that the stock market has been generally trending upward over the same period.



The investor then uses linear regression to model the relationship between the company's profits and its stock price, and they find that there is a strong positive correlation between the two variables. This suggests that as the company's profits have increased, its stock price has also tended to rise.



Based on their analysis, the investor concludes that the company's stock is likely to continue trending upward in the future, and they decide to buy shares of the stock.




What Is a Trend?
A trend is the overall direction of a market during a specified period of time. Trends can be both upward and downward, relating to bullish and bearish markets, respectively. While there is no specified minimum amount of time required for a direction to be considered a trend, the longer the direction is maintained, the more notable the trend. Trends are identified by drawing lines, known as trendlines, that connect price action making higher highs and higher lows for an uptrend, or lower lows and lower highs for a downtrend.




What Is the Formula or Model for Trend Analysis?
There is no one formula for trend analysis, as the specific methods used to analyze trends can vary depending on the data being analyzed and the goals of the analysis. However, there are several statistical measures that are commonly used in trend analysis to identify patterns and trends in data.Here are a few examples of statistical measures that might be used in trend analysis:Moving averages: A moving average is a statistical measure that is used to smooth out fluctuations in data over time. A simple moving average (SMA) is calculated by taking the average of a set of data points over a given period of time, such as the past 10 days or the past 50 weeks. Moving averages can be used to identify trends by smoothing out short-term fluctuations in data and highlighting longer-term patterns.Linear regression: Linear regression is a statistical method that is used to model the relationship between two variables. It can be used to identify trends by fitting a line to the data and determining the slope of the line, which can indicate the direction and strength of the trend.Correlation: Correlation is a statistical measure that indicates the strength and direction of the relationship between two variables. A positive correlation means that the variables are moving in the same direction, while a negative correlation means that they are moving in opposite directions. Correlation can be used to identify trends by analyzing the relationship between two variables over time.It's important to note that these are just a few examples of statistical measures that might be used in trend analysis, and there are many other methods and measures that could also be used depending on the specific needs of the analysis.




What Are Examples of Trend Trading Strategies?
Trend trading strategies attempt to isolate and extract profit from trends by combining a variety of technical indicators along with the financial instrument's price action. Typically, these include moving averages, momentum indicators, and trendlines, and chart patterns.Moving averages strategies involve entering into long, or short, positions when the short-term moving average crosses above, or below, a long-term moving average. Momentum indicator strategies involve entering into positions when a security is exhibiting strong momentum and exiting when that wanes. Trendlines and chart pattern strategies involve entering long, or short, positions when a security is trending higher, or lower, and placing a stop-loss below, or above, key trendline support levels to exit the trade.




How Do You Prepare a Trend Analysis?
To prepare a trend analysis as a trader, you will typically need to follow these steps:Identify the security or market you want to analyze: Decide which security or market you want to analyze in order to identify trends that could inform your trading decisions. This could be a specific stock, bond, currency, commodity, or other financial instrument, or it could be a broader market index or sector.Gather the data: Collect data on the security or market you have identified. This may involve accessing financial statements, downloading market data, or accessing databases or other sources of data.Organize the data: Organize the data in a way that makes it easy to analyze. This could involve creating spreadsheets, charts, or graphs to visualize the data.Analyze the data: Use your chosen method of analysis to identify trends in the data. This could involve looking for patterns in the data, calculating statistical measures such as averages or standard deviations, or using graphical tools such as charts to identify trends.Interpret the results: Once you have identified trends in the data, interpret the results to determine what they mean for your trading decisions. This could involve making predictions about the future direction of the security or market, identifying risks or opportunities, or making recommendations for buying, selling, or holding the security.Use the results to inform your trading decisions: Use the insights gained from your trend analysis to inform your trading decisions. This could involve adjusting your portfolio, placing trades, or making other decisions based on the trends you have identified.




What Are Some Criticisms of Trend Analysis?
Critics of trend analysis, and technical trading in general, argue that markets are efficient, and already price in all available information. That means that history does not necessarily need to repeat itself and that the past does not predict the future. Adherents of fundamental analysis, for example, analyze the financial condition of companies using financial statements and economic models to predict future prices. For these types of investors, day-to-day stock movements follow a random walk that cannot be interpreted as patterns or trends.


   The Bottom Line  

Trend analysis is the study of data to identify patterns or trends that can be used to make investment decisions. This type of analysis is typically used to analyze the performance of a particular security, such as a stock or bond, over a given period of time. By studying trends in data, investors can make informed decisions about whether to buy, sell, or hold a particular security. There are several different methods that can be used to analyze trends, including technical analysis, which uses charts and other graphical tools to identify patterns in price and volume data, and fundamental analysis, which focuses on a company's financial health and industry conditions to make investment decisions. Trend analysis can thus incorporate a variety of data sources, including price charts, financial statements, economic indicators, and market data.
What Is Trend Trading?  

Trend trading is a trading style that attempts to capture gains through the analysis of an asset's momentum in a particular direction. When the price is moving in one overall direction, such as up or down, that is called a trend.



Trend traders enter into a long position when a security is trending upward. An uptrend is characterized by higher swing lows and higher swing highs. Likewise, trend traders may opt to enter a short position when an asset is trending lower. A downtrend is characterized by lower swing lows and lower swing highs.





Key Takeaways

Trend trading is designed to take advantage of uptrends, where the price tends to make new highs, or downtrends, where the price tends to make new lows.An uptrend is a series of higher swing highs and higher swing lows. A downtrend is a series of lower swing highs and lower swing lows.In addition to looking at swing highs and lows, trend traders utilize other tools such as trendlines, moving averages, and technical indicators to help identify the trend direction and potentially provide trade signals.


   Understanding Trend Trading  

Trend trading strategies assume that a security will continue to move in the same direction as it is currently trending. Such strategies often contain a take-profit or stop-loss provision in order to lock in a profit or avoid big losses if a trend reversal occurs. Trend trading is used by short-, intermediate-, and long-term traders.



Traders use both price action and other technical tools to determine the trend direction and when it may be shifting.



Price action traders look at the price movements on a chart. For an uptrend, they want to see the price move above recent highs, and when the price drops it should stay above prior swing lows. This shows that even though the price is oscillating up and down, the overall trajectory is up.



The same concept is applied to downtrends, with traders watching to see if the price makes overall lower lows and lower highs. When that is no longer happening, the downtrend is in question or over, and the trend trader will no longer be interested in holding a short position.


   Trend Trading Strategies  

There are many different trend trading strategies, each using a variety of indicators and price action methods. For all strategies, a stop loss should be used to manage risk. For an uptrend, a stop loss is placed below a swing low that occurred prior to entry, or below another support level. For a downtrend and a short position, a stop loss is often placed just above a prior swing high or above another resistance level.



Oftentimes, traders use a combination of these strategies when looking for trend trading opportunities. A trader might look for a breakout through a resistance level to indicate a move higher may be starting, but only enter into a trade if the price is trading above a specific moving average.


  Moving Averages  

These strategies involve entering a long position when a short-term moving average crosses above a longer-term moving average, or entering a short position when a short-term moving average crosses below a longer-term moving average. Alternatively, some traders may watch for when the price crosses above a moving average to signal a long position, or when the price crosses below the average to signal a short position.



Typically, moving average strategies are combined with some other form of technical analysis to filter out the signals. This may include looking at price action to determine the trend since moving averages provide very poor signals when no trend is present; the price just whipsaws back and forth across the moving average.



Moving averages are also used for analysis. When the price is above a moving average, it helps to indicate that an uptrend may be present. When the price is below the moving average, it helps to indicate that a downtrend may be present.


  Momentum Indicators  

There are many momentum indicators and strategies. In regards to trend trading, an example might include looking for an uptrend and then using the relative strength index (RSI) to signal entries and exits.



For example, a trader may wait for the RSI to drop below 30 and then rise above it. This could signal a long position, assuming the overall uptrend remains intact. The indicator is showing that the price pulled back but is now starting to rise again in alignment with the overall uptrend.



The trader could potentially exit when the RSI rises above 70 or 80 and then falls back below the selected level.


  Trendlines & Chart Patterns  

A trendline is a line drawn along swing lows in an uptrend or along swing highs in a downtrend. It shows a possible area where the price may pull back in the future.



Some traders also opt to buy during an uptrend when the price pulls back and then bounces higher off of a rising trendline, a strategy of buying the dip. Similarly, some traders elect to short during a downtrend when the price rises to and then falls away from a declining trendline.



Trend traders will also watch for chart patterns, such as flags or triangles, which indicate the potential continuation of a trend. For example, if the price is rising aggressively and then forms a flag or triangle, a trend trader will watch for the price to break out of the pattern to signal a continuation of the uptrend.


   Trend Trading Chart Example  

The following Alibaba Group chart shows several examples of how trends can be analyzed, as well as some examples of potential trades using chart patterns and the trend.

The price starts out in a downtrend, before rising through the descending trendline and above the moving average. This doesn't mean the trend is up, though. Trend traders will typically wait for the price to also make a higher swing high and a higher swing low before considering the trend up.



The price continues to move higher, confirming the new uptrend. It then pulls back and starts to rise again, forming the first chart pattern. The price breaks higher out of the chart pattern, signaling a potential long position.



The uptrend continues aggressively, forming two additional chart patterns along the way. These both offered opportunities to enter a long position or add to an existing one (called pyramiding).



The price continues to rise, but then starts giving warning signs. The price drops below the moving average for the first time in a long while. It also creates a lower swing low and breaks through a short-term rising trendline.



The price makes a new high after that, but then drops below the moving average again. This is not strong uptrend behavior, and trend traders would typically avoid going long during conditions like this. They would also be looking to exit any remaining longs they may have.



The chart shows that the price continues to oscillate around the moving average, with no clear trend direction. Finally, the price slides into a downtrend. Trend traders would be out of longs and avoiding new ones, and possibly looking for spots to enter short positions.
What Is a Trendline?  

Trendlines are easily recognizable lines that traders draw on charts to connect a series of prices together or show some data's best fit. The resulting line is then used to give the trader a good idea of the direction in which an investment's value might move.



A trendline is a line drawn over pivot highs or under pivot lows to show the prevailing direction of price. Trendlines are a visual representation of support and resistance in any time frame. They show direction and speed of price, and also describe patterns during periods of price contraction.





Key Takeaways

Trendlines indicate the best fit of some data using a single line or curve.A single trendline can be applied to a chart to give a clearer picture of the trend.Trendlines can be applied to the highs and the lows to create a channel.The time period being analyzed and the exact points used to create a trendline vary from trader to trader.

   What Do Trendlines Tell You?  

The trendline is among the most important tools used by technical analysts. Instead of looking at past business performance or other fundamentals, technical analysts look for trends in price action. A trendline helps technical analysts determine the current direction in market prices. Technical analysts believe the trend is your friend, and identifying this trend is the first step in the process of making a good trade.



To create a trendline, an analyst must have at least two points on a price chart. Some analysts like to use different time frames such as one minute or five minutes. Others look at daily charts or weekly charts. Some analysts put aside time altogether, choosing to view trends based on tick intervals rather than intervals of time. What makes trendlines so universal in usage and appeal is they can be used to help identify trends regardless of the time period, time frame or interval used.



If company A is trading at $35 and moves to $40 in two days and $45 in three days, the analyst has three points to plot on a chart, starting at $35, then moving to $40, and then moving to $45. If the analyst draws a line between all three price points, they have an upward trend. The trendline drawn has a positive slope and is therefore telling the analyst to buy in the direction of the trend. If company A's price goes from $35 to $25, however, the trendline has a negative slope and the analyst should sell in the direction of the trend.






   Example Using a Trendline  

Trendlines are relatively easy to use. A trader simply has to chart the price data normally, using open, close, high and low. Below is data for the Russell 2000 in a candlestick chart with the trendline applied to three session lows over a two month period.












Image by Sabrina Jiang © Investopedia 2020



The trendline shows the uptrend in the Russell 2000 and can be thought of as support when entering a position. In this case, trader may choose enter a long position near the trendline and then extend it into the future. If the price action breaches the trendline on the downside, the trader can use that as a signal to close the position. This allows the trader to exit when the trend they are following starts to weaken.



Trendlines are, of course, a product of the time period. In the example above, a trader doesn't need to redraw the trendline very often. On a time scale of minutes, however, trendlines and trades may need to be readjusted frequently.


   The Difference Between Trendlines and Channels  

More than one trendline can be applied to a chart. Traders often use a trendline connecting highs for a period as well as another to connect lows in order to create channels. A channel adds a visual representation of both support and resistance for the time period being analyzed. Similar to a single trendline, traders are looking for a spike or a breakout to take the price action out of the channel. They may use that breach as an exit point or an entry point depending on how they are setting up their trade.


   Limitations of a Trendline  

Trendlines have limitations shared by all charting tools in that they have to be readjusted as more price data comes in. A trendline will sometimes last for a long time, but eventually the price action will deviate enough that it needs to be updated. Moreover, traders often choose different data points to connect. For example, some traders will use the lowest lows, while others may only use the lowest closing prices for a period. Last, trendlines applied on smaller timeframes can be volume sensitive. A trendline formed on low volume may easily be broken as volume picks up throughout a session.




What Are Stock Trendlines Used for?
Trendlines are used by technical analysts to predict the direction of a stock or other financial security. Armed with a clearer sense of potential direction, analysts can then make better decisions about stock trades.




Who Uses Trendlines?
Trendlines are typically associated with technical financial analysts. However, trendlines can be used by any investor looking to gain more insight into the direction of a stock, commodity, currency, or other investment.




What Are the Different Kinds of Trendlines?
There are a number of different kinds of trendlines. The most common are characterized as linear, logarithmic, polynomial, power, exponential, and moving average.
What Is the Treynor Ratio?  

The Treynor ratio, also known as the reward-to-volatility ratio, is a performance metric for determining how much excess return was generated for each unit of risk taken on by a portfolio.



Excess return in this sense refers to the return earned above the return that could have been earned in a risk-free investment. Although there is no true risk-free investment, treasury bills are often used to represent the risk-free return in the Treynor ratio.



Risk in the Treynor ratio refers to systematic risk as measured by a portfolio's beta. Beta measures the tendency of a portfolio's return to change in response to changes in return for the overall market.





Key Takeaways

The Treynor ratio is a risk/return measure that allows investors to adjust a portfolio's returns for systematic risk.A higher Treynor ratio result means a portfolio is a more suitable investment.The Treynor ratio is similar to the Sharpe ratio, although the Sharpe ratio uses a portfolio's standard deviation to adjust the portfolio returns.



The Treynor ratio was developed by Jack Treynor, an American economist who was one of the inventors of the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM).

In essence, the Treynor ratio is a risk-adjusted measurement of return based on systematic risk. It indicates how much return an investment, such as a portfolio of stocks, a mutual fund, or exchange-traded fund, earned for the amount of risk the investment assumed.



If a portfolio has a negative beta, however, the ratio result is not meaningful. A higher ratio result is more desirable and means that a given portfolio is likely a more suitable investment. Since the Treynor ratio is based on historical data, however, it's important to note this does not necessarily indicate future performance, and one ratio should not be the only factor relied upon for investing decisions.


  How the Treynor Ratio Works  

Ultimately, the Treynor ratio attempts to measure how successful an investment is in providing compensation to investors for taking on investment risk. The Treynor ratio is reliant upon a portfolio's beta—that is, the sensitivity of the portfolio's returns to movements in the market—to judge risk.



The premise behind this ratio is that investors must be compensated for the risk inherent to the portfolio, because diversification will not remove it.


  Difference Between the Treynor Ratio and Sharpe Ratio  

The Treynor ratio shares similarities with the Sharpe ratio, and both measure the risk and return of a portfolio.



The difference between the two metrics is that the Treynor ratio utilizes a portfolio beta, or systematic risk, to measure volatility instead of adjusting portfolio returns using the portfolio's standard deviation as done with the Sharpe ratio.


  Limitations of the Treynor Ratio  

A main weakness of the Treynor ratio is its backward-looking nature. Investments are likely to perform and behave differently in the future than they did in the past. The accuracy of the Treynor ratio is highly dependent on the use of appropriate benchmarks to measure beta.



For example, if the Treynor ratio is used to measure the risk-adjusted return of a domestic large-cap mutual fund, it would be inappropriate to measure the fund's beta relative to the Russell 2000 Small Stock index.



The fund's beta would likely be understated relative to this benchmark since large-cap stocks tend to be less volatile in general than small caps. Instead, the beta should be measured against an index more representative of the large-cap universe, such as the Russell 1000 index.



Additionally, there are no dimensions upon which to rank the Treynor ratio. When comparing similar investments, the higher Treynor ratio is better, all else equal, but there is no definition of how much better it is than the other investments.
What Is a Trial Balance?  

A trial balance is a bookkeeping worksheet in which the balances of all ledgers are compiled into debit and credit account column totals that are equal. A company prepares a trial balance periodically, usually at the end of every reporting period. The general purpose of producing a trial balance is to ensure that the entries in a company’s bookkeeping system are mathematically correct.



A trial balance is so called because it provides a test of a fundamental aspect of a set of books, but is not a full audit of them. A trial balance is often the first step in an audit procedure, because it allows auditors to make sure there are no mathematical errors in the bookkeeping system before moving on to more complex and detailed analyses.





Key Takeaways

A trial balance is a worksheet with two columns, one for debits and one for credits, that ensures a company’s bookkeeping is mathematically correct. The debits and credits include all business transactions for a company over a certain period, including the sum of such accounts as assets, expenses, liabilities, and revenues. Debits and credits of a trial balance must tally to ensure that there are no mathematical errors, but there could still be mistakes or errors in the accounting systems.

   How a Trial Balance Works  

Preparing a trial balance for a company serves to detect any mathematical errors that have occurred in the double entry accounting system. If the total debits equal the total credits, the trial balance is considered to be balanced, and there should be no mathematical errors in the ledgers. However, this does not mean that there are no errors in a company’s accounting system. For example, transactions classified improperly or those simply missing from the system still could be material accounting errors that would not be detected by the trial balance procedure.


   Requirements for a Trial Balance  

Companies initially record their business transactions in bookkeeping accounts within the general ledger. Depending on the kinds of business transactions that have occurred, accounts in the ledgers could have been debited or credited during a given accounting period before they are used in a trial balance worksheet. Furthermore, some accounts may have been used to record multiple business transactions. As a result, the ending balance of each ledger account as shown in the trial balance worksheet is the sum of all debits and credits that have been entered to that account based on all related business transactions.






A company’s transactions are recorded in a general ledger and later summed to be included in a trial balance. 



At the end of an accounting period, the accounts of asset, expense, or loss should each have a debit balance, and the accounts of liability, equity, revenue, or gain should each have a credit balance. However, certain accounts of the former type also may have been credited and certain accounts of the latter type also may have been debited during the accounting period when related business transactions reduce their respective accounts’ debit and credit balances, an opposite effect on those accounts’ ending debit or credit balances. On a trial balance worksheet, all of the debit balances form the left column, and all of the credit balances form the right column, with the account titles placed to the far left of the two columns.


   Types of Trial Balance  

There are three main types of trial balance:



The unadjusted trial balanceThe adjusted trial balanceThe post-closing trial balance



All three of these types have exactly the same format but slightly different uses. The unadjusted trial balance is prepared on the fly, before adjusting journal entries are completed. It is a record of day-to-day transactions and can be used to balance a ledger by adjusting entries.



Once a book is balanced, an adjusted trial balance can be completed. This trial balance has the final balances in all the accounts, and it is used to prepare the financial statements. The post-closing trial balance shows the balances after the closing entries have been completed. This is your starting trial balance for the next year.


   Trial Balance vs. Balance Sheet  

The key difference between a trial balance and a balance sheet is one of scope. A balance sheet records not only the closing balances of accounts within a company but also the assets, liabilities, and equity of the company. It is usually released to the public, rather than just being used internally, and requires the signature of an auditor to be regarded as trustworthy.



A trial balance is a less formal document. There are no special conventions about how trial balances should be prepared, and they may be completed as often as a company needs them. A trial balance is often used as a tool to keep track of a company’s finances throughout the year, whereas a balance sheet is a legal statement of the financial position of a company at the end of a financial year.


   Special Considerations  

After all the ledger accounts and their balances are listed on a trial balance worksheet in their standard format, add up all debit balances and credit balances separately to prove the equality between total debits and total credits. Such uniformity guarantees that there are no unequal debits and credits that have been incorrectly entered during the double entry recording process. However, a trial balance cannot detect bookkeeping errors that are not simple mathematical mistakes. If equal debits and credits are entered into the wrong accounts, a transaction is not recorded, or offsetting errors are made with a debit and a credit at the same time, a trial balance still would show a perfect balance between total debits and credits.




What is a trial balance used for?
A trial balance can be used to detect any mathematical errors that have occurred in a double entry accounting system. If the total debits equal the total credits, the trial balance is considered to be balanced, and there should be no mathematical errors in the ledgers.




What are the three trial balances?
There are three types of trial balance: the unadjusted trial balance, the adjusted trial balance, and the post-closing trial balance. Each is used at different stages in the accounting cycle.




What is included in a trial balance?
It depends. Companies can use a trial balance to keep track of their financial position, and so they may prepare several different types of trial balance throughout the financial year. A trial balance may contain all the major accounting items, including assets, liabilities, equity, revenues, expenses, gains, and losses.


   The Bottom Line  

A trial balance is a worksheet with two columns, one for debits and one for credits, that ensures a company’s bookkeeping is mathematically correct. The debits and credits include all business transactions for a company over a certain period, including the sum of such accounts as assets, expenses, liabilities, and revenues. 



Debits and credits of a trial balance must tally to ensure that there are no mathematical errors. However, there still could be mistakes or errors in the accounting systems. A trial balance can be used to assess the financial position of a company between full annual audits.
What Is a Triangle Chart Pattern?  

A triangle is a chart pattern is a tool used in technical analysis. The triangle chart pattern is named as such because it resembles a triangle. It is depicted by drawing trendlines along a converging price range, that connotes a pause in the prevailing trend. Technical analysts categorize triangles as continuation patterns of an existing trend or reversal. Despite being a continuation, traders should look for breakouts before they make a move to enter or exit a position.





Key Takeaways

In technical analysis, a triangle is a continuation pattern on a chart that forms a triangle-like shape.Triangles are similar to wedges and pennants and can be either a continuation pattern, if validated, or a powerful reversal pattern, in the event of failure.There are three potential triangle variations that can develop as price action carves out a holding pattern, namely ascending, descending, and symmetrical triangles.






   Understanding Triangle Chart Patterns  

Triangle chart patterns are used in technical analysis, which is a trading strategy that involves charts and patterns that help traders identify trends in the market to make predictions about future performance. Triangle patterns are aptly named because the upper and lower trendlines ultimately meet at the apex on the right side, forming a corner. These patterns are formed once the trading range of a stock or another security becomes narrow.



Connecting the start of the upper trendline to the beginning of the lower trendline completes the other two corners to create the triangle. The upper trendline is formed by connecting the highs, while the lower trendline is formed by connecting the lows.



Triangles are similar to wedges (price patterns marked by converging trendlines) and pennants (continuation patterns that are formed when an asset shows a large movement), which are also used in technical analysis. They can be either a continuation pattern, if validated, or a powerful reversal pattern, in the event of failure. Traders use triangles to highlight when the narrowing of a stock or security's trading range after a downtrend or uptrend occurs.



There are three potential triangle variations that can develop as price action carves out a holding pattern, namely ascending, descending, and symmetrical triangles. Technicians see a breakout, or a failure, of a triangular pattern, especially on heavy volume, as being potent bullish or bearish signals of a resumption, or reversal, of the prior trend.






Technical tools are meant to help make predictions about future trends based on past performance. But remember that the market can be very unpredictable and can swing in any direction at any time.


   Types of Triangle Chart Patterns  

The following diagram shows the three basic types of triangle chart patterns: the ascending, descending, and symmetrical triangles. We go into more detail about what they are and how they work below.

  Ascending Triangle  

An ascending triangle is a breakout pattern that forms when the price breaches the upper horizontal trendline with rising volume. It is a bullish formation.



The upper trendline must be horizontal, indicating nearly identical highs, which form a resistance level. The lower trendline is rising diagonally, indicating higher lows as buyers patiently step up their bids.



Buyers eventually lose patience and rush into the security above the resistance price, which triggers more buying as the uptrend resumes. The upper trendline, which was formerly a resistance level, now becomes support.


  Descending Triangle  

A descending triangle is an inverted version of the ascending triangle and is considered a breakdown pattern. The lower trendline should be horizontal, connecting near identical lows. The upper trendline declines diagonally toward the apex.



The breakdown occurs when the price collapses through the lower horizontal trendline support as a downtrend resumes. The lower trendline, which was support, now becomes resistance.


  Symmetrical Triangle  

A symmetrical triangle is composed of a diagonal falling upper trendline and a diagonally rising lower trendline. As the price moves toward the apex, it will inevitably breach the upper trendline for a breakout and uptrend on rising prices or breach the lower trendline forming a breakdown and downtrend with falling prices.



Traders should watch for a volume spike and at least two closes beyond the trendline to confirm the break is valid and not a head fake. Symmetrical triangles tend to be continuation break patterns, which means they tend to break in the direction of the initial move before the triangle forms. So if an uptrend precedes a symmetrical triangle, traders would expect the price to break to the upside.




How Do Triangles Work in Technical Analysis?
Triangles are chart patterns used in technical analysis. Named because they look like triangles, these patterns connect the beginning of the upper trendline to the beginning of the lower come. The upper line connects the highs while the lower line connects the lows in that security.




What Is Technical Analysis?
Technical analysis is a type of trading strategy where traders analyze markets and make predictions about future market movements based on past performance. This trading strategy uses tools and techniques to evaluate historical data, including asset prices and trading volumes, rather than business results. Some of the tools used include charts and graphs, including triangles and candlesticks.




Are Triangle Patterns Bullish or Bearish?
That depends on the type of triangle. Ascending triangles tend to be bullish as they indicate the continuation of an upward trend. In some cases, they may also point to the reversal of a downtrend. A descending triangle, on the other hand, are bearish. That's because they point to the continuation of a downtrend or the reversal of an uptrend.


   The Bottom Line  

Technical analysis requires a great deal of practice and patience. This is true of any type of trading tool used in this strategy, including triangle chart patterns. It's important to keep in mind that the market is very unpredictable and can swing in any direction even if these tools can be used to make predictions about trends. If you're going to use triangle patterns, make sure you take positions only after you confirm a breakout in the price action of the security in question.
What Is Triangular Arbitrage?  

Triangular arbitrage is the result of a discrepancy between three foreign currencies that occurs when the currency's exchange rates do not exactly match up. These opportunities are rare, and traders who take advantage of them usually have advanced computer equipment and/or programs to automate the process.



A trader employing triangular arbitrage, for example, could make the following series of exchanges—USD to EUR to GBP to USD using the EUR/USD, EUR/GBP, and USD/GDP rates, and (assuming low transaction costs) net a profit.





Key Takeaways

Triangular arbitrage is a form of low-risk profit-making by currency traders that takes advantage of exchange rate discrepancies through algorithmic trades.To ensure profits, such trades should be performed quickly and should be large in size.Because triangular arbitrage opportunities are regularly exploited, currency markets become more efficient.


   Understanding Triangular Arbitrage  

This type of arbitrage can result in a "riskless" profit if quoted currency exchange rates do not equal the market's cross-exchange rate. In other words, if two currencies also trade against some third currency, then the exchange rates of all three should be synchronized. Otherwise, a profit opportunity exists.



International banks, who make markets in currencies, exploit an inefficiency where one market is overvalued and another is undervalued. Price differences between exchange rates are only fractions of a cent, and for this form of arbitrage to be profitable, a trader must trade a large amount of capital.


   Automated Trading Platforms and Triangular Arbitrage  

Automated trading platforms have streamlined the way trades are executed, as an algorithm is created in which a trade is automatically conducted once specific criteria are met. Automated trading platforms allow a trader to set rules for entering and exiting a trade, and the computer will automatically conduct the trade according to the rules. While automated trading has many benefits, such as the ability to test a set of rules on historical data before risking capital, engaging in triangular arbitrage is only feasible using an automated trading platform.



Since the market is essentially a self-correcting entity, trades happen at such a rapid pace that an arbitrage opportunity can vanish within seconds of appearing. Automated trading platform are generally set to identify an opportunity and act on it before it disappears.






The speed of algorithmic trading platforms and markets can also work against traders. For example, a traders may not be able to lock in a profitable price before it moves past their desired position in less than a second, causing a loss.


   Example of Triangular Arbitrage  

Let's say you have $1 million and are provided with the following exchange rates: EUR/USD = 1.1586, EUR/GBP = 1.4600, and USD/GBP = 1.6939.



Now, you want to see if there is a triangular arbitrage opportunity, so you calculate the following:



Sell dollars to buy euros: $1 million x 1.1586 = €1,158,600Sell euros for pounds: €1,158,600 ÷ 1.4600 = £793,561.64Sell pounds for dollars: £793,561.64 x 1.6939 = $1,344,214.06Subtract the initial investment from the final amount: $1,000,000 – $1,344,214.06 = -$344,214.06



From these transactions, you would receive a loss of $344,214.06 (assuming no transaction costs or taxes), so there is no triangular arbitrage opportunity. If the result had been positive, there would have been an arbitrage opportunity.






Arbitrage is buying one asset and selling it in another market for a profit. The technique can be used in many markets.


  Converting Pairs  

Converting currencies can be confusing. A mantra exists to help people remember—"left to right, divide; right to left, multiply," referring to the direction in which you read the exchange rate.



For example, using only the EUR/USD spot rate of $1.08 on 20 May, 2023 to convert €1,000,000 from EUR to USD and back (treat the backslash as a division symbol):



€1,000,000 ÷ $1.08 = $925,925.93Multiply both sides of the equation by $1.08€1,000,000 = $925,925.93 x $1.08



So, converting dollars to euros using the EUR/USD spot price requires multiplying, because you read the pair from right to left.




What Is the Triangular Arbitrage Algorithm?
A triangular arbitrage algorithm is an automated trading program that finds and executes triangular arbitrage opportunities.




Is Crypto Triangular Arbitrage Possible?
Triangular arbitrage identifies price differences for trading opportunities, so it might be possible to find three cryptocurrencies that allow you to use the strategy.




Is Triangular Arbitrage Illegal?
Buying and selling currency is legal. As long as all funds, information sources, and other practices are not against any laws, there is nothing illegal about the triangular arbitrage trading strategy.


   The Bottom Line  

Triangular arbitrage is a strategy where you find price discrepancies between three currencies and buy and sell them in a specific order to make a profit. Because of the constant and rapid fluctuation in exchange rates, it can be risky, so you need to be well-practiced to attempt it or use a proven automated trading method.

What Is Trickle-Down Economics?  

Trickle-down economics and its policies employ the theory that tax breaks and benefits for corporations and the wealthy will trickle down and eventually benefit everyone.



Tools like reduced income tax and capital gains tax breaks are offered to large businesses, investors, and entrepreneurs to stimulate economic growth.





Key Takeaways

The trickle-down theory states that tax breaks and benefits for corporations and the wealthy will trickle down to everyone else.Trickle-down economics involves less regulation and tax cuts for those in high-income tax brackets as well as corporations.Critics argue that the added benefits the wealthy receive add to the growing income inequality in the country.

   Understanding Trickle-Down Economics  

Trickle-down economics is a common political debate, associated with supply-side economics. While there is no single comprehensive economic policy identified as trickle-down economics, a policy is considered “trickle-down” if it disproportionately benefits wealthy businesses and individuals in the short run but is designed to boost standards of living for all individuals in the long run.



Both President Herbert Hoover’s stimulus efforts during the Great Depression and President Ronald Reagan's use of income tax cuts were described as "trickle-down."



Supply-side economics theorists believe that less regulation and tax cuts for corporations and high-income earners trigger company investment and stimulate employment.


   Trickle-Down Economic Policies  

Corporate income tax reduction, tax cuts for the wealthy, and deregulation are the initial steps of a trickle-down policy. As more money remains in the corporate sector, business investment may be triggered with new factories, upgraded technology, equipment, and an increase in employment.



Wealthy individuals may spend more, creating more demand for goods in the economy. The increase in the labor market leads to more spending and investing, creating growth in industries such as housing, automobiles, consumer goods, and retail.



The boost in the economy leads to tax revenue increases and according to the trickle-down economic theory, the additional revenue will pay for the original tax cuts for the wealthy and corporations.


   Trickle-Down Economics and the Laffer Curve  

American economist Arthur Laffer, a member of the Reagan administration, developed a bell-curve style analysis that plotted the relationship between changes in the official government tax rate and actual tax receipts, known as the Laffer Curve.



The nonlinear shape of the Laffer Curve suggested taxes could be too light or too onerous to produce maximum revenue. A 0% income tax rate and a 100% income tax rate each produce $0 in receipts to the government.



At 0%, no tax can be collected but at 100%, there is no incentive to generate income, suggesting that specific cuts in tax rates would boost total receipts by encouraging more taxable income.













Laffer’s idea that tax cuts could boost growth and tax revenue was quickly labeled “trickle-down.” Under President Reagan, between 1980 and 1988, the top marginal tax rate in the United States fell from 70% to 28%. Between 1981 and 1989, total federal receipts increased from $599 billion to $991 billion.



The results empirically supported one of the assumptions of the Laffer Curve, but could not prove a correlation between a reduction in top tax rates and economic benefits to low- and medium-income earners.


   Criticism of Trickle Down Economics  

Although trickle-down theorists argue that more money in the hands of the wealthy and corporations promotes spending and free-market capitalism, it does so only with government intervention.



Critics argue that the added benefits the wealthy receive can distort the economic structure as lower-income earners without an equal tax cut adds to income inequality. Many economists counter that cutting taxes for the poor and working families boosts the economy by increasing spending on goods and services whereas a tax cut for a corporation may go to stock buybacks or increased savings for the wealthy.



Many factors drive growth, including Federal Reserve monetary policy and lowering interest rates. Trade and exports, sales from U.S. companies to foreign companies, as well as foreign direct investment from corporations and investors overseas, contribute to the economy.



In December 2020, a London School of Economics report by David Hope and Julian Limberg was released which examined five decades of tax cuts in 18 wealthy nations and found they consistently benefited the wealthy but had no meaningful effect on unemployment or economic growth.




What Is the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act?
Trickle-down policies are common with Republican leaders. President Donald Trump signed into law the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act on Dec. 22., 2017, which cut personal tax rates and personal exemptions which expire in 2025 and revert to the old, higher rates. However, corporations received a permanent tax cut to 21%. Critics of the plan say the top 1% get the larger tax cut versus those in lower income brackets.




How Did President Hoover Use Trickle-Down Economics?
President Hoover believed incentivizing business prosperity would trickle down to the average person and that economic assistance to citizens would stifle the workforce. This philosophy was not effective against the Depression and his failure to end it led to his defeat in the 1932 presidential election against Franklin D. Roosevelt and the New Deal.




What Is Reaganomics?
Reaganomics is the economic policy instituted by President Ronald Reagan who instituted tax cuts, decreased social spending, increased military spending, and market deregulation, all influenced by the trickle-down theory and supply-side economics.


   The Bottom Line  

The trickle-down theory includes commonly debated policies associated with supply-side economics. A policy is considered a “trickle-down” if it benefits wealthy businesses and individuals in the short run to boost standards of living for all individuals and the economy in the long run. Presidents Hoover, Reagan, and Trump have all employed methods of trickle-down economic policies.
What Is a Triggering Event?  

A triggering event is a tangible or intangible barrier or occurrence which, once breached or met, causes another event to occur. Triggering events include job loss, retirement, or death, and are typical for many types of contracts. These triggers help to prevent, or ensure, that in the case of a catastrophic change, the terms of an original contract may also change.



Life insurance policies may include a triggering event based on the insured age. Also, many employers require employees to reach a qualifying period of employment as a triggering event for eligibility for specific company benefits. In the investment sphere, stops are a triggering event which the investor may initiate to limit their downside risk.





Key Takeaways

Contracts often maintain contingency clauses that alter the rights and obligations that the parties to the contract are subject to.Triggering events include job loss, retirement, or death and are typical for many types of contracts.These triggers help to prevent, or ensure, that in the case of a catastrophic change, the terms of an original contract may also change.Insurance policies are contracts that have important triggering events in order to initiate a claim.


   Understanding a Triggering Event  

Triggering events can encompass a wide assortment of areas and contracts. For example, hedge funds sign documents that trigger termination events when their net asset value (NAV) falls below a certain level in a given period of time. These are usually outlined in an ISDA and may result in a fund's positions being closed out by the dealer if the dealer chooses to act upon the trigger.



The age limits in retirement plans can also be trigger events. For most retirement plans, such as 401(k)s, individuals are not allowed to withdraw funds without a penalty until they reach a specific age. Once that age limit is reached, they are free to withdraw funds without incurring a penalty.



A triggering event is any occurrence that alters the current state of a contract.


   Triggering Events in Insurance  

Insurance companies will include triggers, called coverage triggers, in the policies they underwrite. In the case of property or casualty coverage, it will specify the type of event which must take place for liability protection to apply. Insurers use triggering events to limit their risk exposure. Some typical triggering events include:



Attainment of retirement age, as defined under the plan
Termination of employment
A participant becomes disabled, as described under the plan
The death of the participant



In some universal life insurance policies, in-service withdrawals are allowed from the cash portion of the policy within the contract. These withdrawals allow for tax and penalty-free distributions before an age-based triggering event.



Workers' compensation is another insurance that requires a triggering event to happen before it is effective. As an example, if an individual has an accident while at work, that event would "trigger" disability payouts from insurance.



The most common triggering event in an insurance policy is a cause to initiate a claim. For instance, in life insurance, the death of the insured would be the triggering event that leads to the payout of the death benefit to the insured's beneficiaries.


   Triggering Events With Banks  

It is common for banks to issue debt at a given interest rate on specific terms. For example, when writing a loan, one of a bank's requirements could be that the borrowing party does not incur any additional debt for the duration of the loan.



If the borrower should incur more debt, the contract's triggering event, or clause, will kick in. The bank may then take necessary actions to protect themselves which may include foreclosure of property secured through the loan or increasing the original rate of interest charged.



Triggering events also occur in relation to defaults on loans. Banks can stipulate certain triggers that will determine a default. If any covenants that were agreed upon beforehand are breached then that would trigger a default. Cross defaults are common trigger events whereby if an individual or business defaults on one loan it means that they have defaulted on all the other loans under the cross-default agreement.



Banks can include a wide range of default triggering events so it is important to carefully understand your contract before signing.
What Is a Trilemma?  

Trilemma is a term in economic decision-making theory. Unlike a dilemma, which has two solutions, a trilemma offers three equal solutions to a complex problem. A trilemma suggests that countries have three options from which to choose when making fundamental decisions about managing their international monetary policy agreements. However, the options of the trilemma are conflictual because of mutual exclusivity, which makes only one option of the trilemma achievable at a given time.



Trilemma often is synonymous with the "impossible trinity," also called the Mundell-Fleming trilemma. This theory exposes the instability inherent in using the three primary options available to a country when establishing and monitoring its international monetary policy agreements.





Key Takeaways

The trilemma is an economic theory, which posits that countries may choose from three options when making fundamental decisions about their international monetary policy agreements.However, only one option of the trilemma is achievable at a given time, as the three options of the trilemma are mutually exclusive.Today, most countries favor free flow of capital and autonomous monetary policy.


   Trilemma Explained  

When making fundamental decisions about managing international monetary policy, a trilemma suggests that countries have three possible options from which to choose. According to the Mundell-Fleming trilemma model, these options include:



Setting a fixed currency exchange rate
Allowing capital to flow freely with no fixed currency exchange rate agreement

The technicalities of each option conflict because of mutual exclusivity. As such, mutual exclusivity makes only one side of the trilemma triangle achievable at a given time.



Side A: A country can choose to fix exchange rates with one or more countries and have a free flow of capital with others. If it chooses this scenario, independent monetary policy is not achievable because interest rate fluctuations would create currency arbitrage stressing the currency pegs and causing them to break.Side B: The country can choose to have a free flow of capital among all foreign nations and also have an autonomous monetary policy. Fixed exchange rates among all nations and the free flow of capital are mutually exclusive. As a result, only one can be chosen at a time. So, if there is a free flow of capital among all nations, there cannot be fixed exchange rates.Side C: If a country chooses fixed exchange rates and independent monetary policy it cannot have a free flow of capital. Again, in this instance, fixed exchange rates and the free flow of capital are mutually exclusive.


   Government Considerations  

The challenge for a government’s international monetary policy comes in choosing which of these options to pursue and how to manage them. Generally, most countries favor side B of the triangle because they can enjoy the freedom of independent monetary policy and allow the policy to help guide the flow of capital.


   Academic Influences  

The theory of the policy trilemma is frequently credited to the economists Robert Mundell and Marcus Fleming, who independently described the relationships among exchange rates, capital flows, and monetary policy in the 1960s. Maurice Obstfeld, who became chief economist at the International Monetary Fund (IMF) in 2015, presented the model they developed as a "trilemma" in a 1997 paper. 



The French economist Hélène Rey argued that the trilemma is not as simple as it appears. In the modern day, Rey believes that the majority of countries are faced with only two options, or a dilemma, since fixed currency pegs are not usually effective, leading to a focus on the relationship between independent monetary policy and free capital flow.


   Real World Example  

A real-world example of solving these trade-offs occurs in the eurozone, where countries are closely interconnected. By forming the eurozone and using one currency, the countries have ultimately opted for side A of the triangle, maintaining a single currency (in effect a one-to-one peg coupled with the free capital flow).



Following World War II, the wealthy opted for side C under the Bretton Woods Agreement, which pegged currencies to the U.S. dollar but allowed countries to set their own interest rates. Cross-border capital flows were so small that this system held for a couple of decades—the exception being Mundell's native Canada, where he gained special insight into the tensions inherent in the Bretton Woods system.
What Is Trillion Cubic Feet (Tcf)?  

The term trillion cubic feet refers to a volume measurement of natural gas used by the U.S. oil and gas industry. The measurement is usually abbreviated as Tcf. A cubic foot is a nonmetric measurement of volume also used in the U.S. A trillion—written in numerals as 1,000,000,000,000—cubic feet is equivalent to approximately one quad of Btu or a British thermal unit.





Key Takeaways

The term trillion cubic feet is a volume measurement of natural gas used by the U.S. oil and gas industry.The measurement of a trillion cubic feet is abbreviated as Tcf in the industry.A trillion cubic feet is equivalent to approximately one quadrillion of a British thermal unit.


   Understanding Trillion Cubic Feet (Tcf)  

In the United States, companies measure natural gas in cubic feet. A trillion cubic feet can be hard to imagine for the average person. It can represent billions of dollars of the commodity. As mentioned above, one trillion cubic feet is the same as one quad of Btu. A quad is the abbreviation for a quadrillion, or 1,000,000,000,000,000. A Btu, on the other hand, measures energy, and represents how much heat is required to raise the temperature of a single pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit at sea level. For reference's sake, a single Btu is the same as the heat from a kitchen match stick.



Most of the major international oil and gas companies have standardized reports to help analysts and investors accurately assess these figures. This is due, in part, to a regulatory requirement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) requiring foreign companies with stock listed on U.S. exchanges to file standardized reports on an annual basis, called a 20-F. This is equivalent to the 10-K filing for U.S. companies and provides investors with oil and gas production and reserve statistics published using imperial measurements to allow direct comparison.



Investors in emerging markets of Russia, Africa, or Latin America often receive reports with data reported with the metric system, which is a global measurement system. Analysts of these companies will need to use conversion tables to accurately quantify and compare them to more sophisticated international operators.






Investors in markets like Russia, Africa, or Latin America often receive reports with data reported in the metric system.


   Special Considerations  

Within the oil and gas industry, units of measurement are represented by letters where T is the equivalent of one trillion, B represents one billion, MM equals one million, and M means one thousand. Any of these can appear before certain terms, such as MMBOE or million barrel of oil equivalent, or Tcf, which is trillion cubic feet.



So just as a trillion cubic feet is abbreviated as Tcf, just as Bcf refers to a billion cubic feet. The latter is a gas measurement equal to approximately one trillion (1,000,000,000,000) Btu. Mcf stands for one thousand cubic feet, a measure used more commonly in the low volume segments of the gas industry, such as stripper well production. Incidentally, Mcf is the conventional way to measure natural gas in the United States, which uses the imperial measuring system.



In Europe, where the metric system is used, the abbreviation most commonly used is thousand of cubic meters or Mcm. Oil and gas financial analysts need to be especially careful when analyzing companies' quarterly results to avoid mixing up various units. For example, it is quite easy to overlook the fact that U.S. companies will report in Mcf, while European companies often report in Mcm. This makes quite a difference because 1Mcm = 35.3Mcf.


   Example of Trillion Cubic Feet  

The U.S. Energy Information Administration reports the world's natural gas reserves by country. As of 2019, according to the site, Russia had the highest reserves of natural gas with 1,688 Tcf, followed by Iran with 1,194 Tcf. The U.S. was fourth, with 465 Tcf. The list was rounded out by Belarus and the Czech Republic, which both reported 0.01 Tcf of natural gas each.
What Is a Trimmed Mean?  

A trimmed mean (similar to an adjusted mean) is a method of averaging that removes a small designated percentage of the largest and smallest values before calculating the mean. After removing the specified outlier observations, the trimmed mean is found using a standard arithmetic averaging formula. The use of a trimmed mean helps eliminate the influence of outliers or data points on the tails that may unfairly affect the traditional or arithmetic mean.



Trimmed means are used in reporting economic data in order to smooth the results and paint a more realistic picture.





Key Takeaways

A trimmed mean removes a small designated percentage of the largest and smallest values before calculating the average.Using a trimmed mean helps eliminate the influence of outliers or data points on the tails that may unfairly affect the traditional mean.Trimmed means are used in reporting economic data in order to smooth the results and paint a more realistic picture.Providing a trimmed mean inflation rate, along with other measures, provides a basis for comparison.


   Understanding a Trimmed Mean  

A mean is a mathematical average of two or more numbers while the trimmed mean helps to reduce the effects of outliers on the calculated average. The trimmed mean is best suited for data with large, erratic deviations or extremely skewed distributions.



A trimmed mean is stated as a mean trimmed by x%, where x is the sum of the percentage of observations removed from both the upper and lower bounds. The trimming points are often arbitrary in that they follow rules of thumb rather than some optimized method of setting those thresholds. For example, a trimmed mean of 3% would remove the lowest and highest 3% of values, leaving the mean to be calculated from the 94% of remaining data.



A trimmed mean is seen as a more realistic representation of a data set as the few erratic outliers have been removed that could otherwise potentially skew the information. A trimmed mean is also known as a truncated mean.


   Trimmed Means and Inflation Rates  

A trimmed mean may be used in place of a traditional mean when determining inflation rates from the Consumer Price Index (CPI) or personal consumption expenditures (PCE). The CPI and the PCE price index measure the prices of baskets of goods in an economy to help identify inflation: rising price trends.



The levels that are trimmed from each tail may not be equitable, as these values are instead based on historical data to reach the best fit between the trimmed mean inflation rate and the inflation rate’s core.



The core of the CPI or PCE refers to the selected products minus prices associated with food or energy. Food and energy costs are generally considered the most volatile, also referred to as noisy, items within the data. Shifts in the non-core area are not necessarily indicative of overall inflationary activities.



When the data points are organized, they are placed in ascending order based on those prices that fell the most, to the prices that rose the most. Specific percentages are removed from the tails to help lower the effect of volatility on the overall CPI changes.






Trimmed means are used in the Olympics to remove extreme scoring from possibly biased judges who may impact an athlete's average score.



Providing a trimmed mean inflation rate along with other measures, provides a basis for comparison, allowing for a more thorough analysis of the inflation rates being experienced. This comparison may include the traditional CPI, the core CPI, a trimmed-mean CPI, and a median CPI.


   Example of a Trimmed Mean  

Let's say, as an example, a figure skating competition produces the following scores: 6.0, 8.1, 8.3, 9.1, and 9.9.



The mean for the scores would equal:



((6.0 + 8.1 + 8.3 + 9.1 + 9.9) / 5) = 8.28



To trim the mean by a total of 40%, we remove the lowest 20% and the highest 20% of values, eliminating the scores of 6.0 and 9.9.



Next, we calculate the mean based on the calculation:



(8.1 + 8.3 + 9.1) / 3 = 8.50



In other words, a mean trimmed at 40% would equal 8.5 versus 8.28, which reduced the outlier bias and had the effect of increasing the reported average by 0.22 points.
What Is a Triple Bottom?  

A triple bottom is a bullish chart pattern used in technical analysis that's characterized by three equal lows followed by a breakout above the resistance level.





Key Takeaways

A triple bottom is a visual pattern that shows the buyers (bulls) taking control of the price action from the sellers (bears).A triple bottom is generally seen as three roughly equal lows bouncing off support followed by the price action breaching resistance. The formation of triple bottom is seen as an opportunity to enter a bullish position. 


   Understanding a Triple Bottom  

The triple bottom chart pattern typically follows a prolonged downtrend where bears are in control of the market. While the first bottom could simply be normal price movement, the second bottom is indicative of the bulls gaining momentum and preparing for a possible reversal. The third bottom indicates that there's strong support in place and bears may capitulate when the price breaks through resistance levels.



There are a few rules that are commonly used to qualify triple bottoms:



There should be an existing downtrend in place before the pattern occurs.
The three lows should be roughly equal in price and spaced out from each other. While the price doesn't have to be exactly equal, it should be reasonably close to the same price, such that a trendline is horizontal.
The volume should drop throughout the pattern in a sign that bears are losing strength, while bullish volume should increase as the price breaks through the final resistance.


   How to Trade a Triple Bottom  

The price target for a double bottom reversal is typically the distance between the lows and the breakout point added to the breakout point. For example, if the low is $10.00 and the breakout is at $12.00, the price target would be (12 - 10 = 2 + 12 = 14) $14.00. Stop-loss points are usually placed just below the breakout point and/or below the triple bottom lows.



The triple bottom is similar to the double bottom chart pattern and may also look like ascending or descending triangles. Traders always look for confirmation of a triple bottom using other technical indicators or chart patterns. For example, traders might note that the stock has an oversold relative strength index (RSI) before a double bottom forms and/or look for a breakout to confirm that it's a triple bottom rather than a descending triangle or other bearish pattern.


   An Example of a Triple Bottom  

The following chart shows an example of a triple bottom chart pattern.

In this example, Momenta Pharmaceuticals' stock formed a triple bottom and broke out from trend line resistance. The difference between the third bottom and the breakout point was about $1.75, which translated to a take-profit point of around $15.50 on the upside. The stop-loss point could have been placed at around $13.50 to limit downside risk as well.


   The Difference Between a Triple Bottom and a Triple Top  

The triple top is the opposite pattern of a triple bottom. Instead of a bullish reversal, a triple top is a bearish reversal pattern where price action bumps off resistance three times, posting three roughly equal highs before plummeting down through resistance.



That said, these are essentially mirror patterns of the same market phenomenon—a prolonged battle for control between the bears and bulls where one side emerges victorious. If no winner emerges, a triple bottom or top will simply become a longer term range.


   Limitations of a Triple Bottom  

There is always some uncertainty when trading charting patterns as you are working with probability. As with most patterns, the triple bottom is easiest to recognize once the trading opportunity has passed. Double bottoms may fail and become a triple bottom, and the triple bottom and the head and shoulders pattern can, by definition, be one and the same.



However, the most often cited limitation of a triple bottom is simply that it is not a great risk and reward tradeoff because of the placement of the target and stop loss. To ramp up the profit potential, traders may choose to put their stop loss inside the pattern and trail it up as the breakout occurs. The issue with this is the likelihood of being stopped out in the range for a small loss is higher.




Is a Triple Bottom Bullish or Bearish?
A triple bottom pattern is a bullish chart reversal pattern that suggests a breakout to the upside.




What Happens After a Triple Bottom?
After the third relatively equal low is spotted, traders can anticipate the trend will move to the upside, break resistence levels, and reach higher prices.




Is a Triple Top Pattern a Good Sign?
The opposite of a triple bottom pattern, a triple top pattern is a bearish chart pattern that suggests a move to the downside.
What Is the Triple Bottom Line (TBL)?  

In economics, the triple bottom line (TBL) maintains that companies should commit to focusing as much on social and environmental concerns as they do on profits. TBL theory posits that instead of one bottom line, there should be three: profit, people, and the planet. A TBL seeks to gauge a corporation's level of commitment to corporate social responsibility and its impact on the environment over time.



In 1994, John Elkington—the famed British management consultant and sustainability guru—coined the phrase "triple bottom line" as his way of measuring performance in corporate America. The idea was that a company can be managed in a way that not only makes money but which also improves people's lives and the well-being of the planet.





Key Takeaways

The concept behind the triple bottom line is that companies should focus as much on social and environmental issues as they do on profits.The TBL consists of three elements: profit, people, and the planet.The triple bottom line aims to measure the financial, social, and environmental performance of a company over time.TBL may result in retaining employees, increasing external investments, boosting sales from ESG-interested customers, and gaining long-term operational efficiencies.TBL may also be difficult to measure, costly to implement, and cause competing strategies across triple bottom line components.


   Understanding the Triple Bottom Line (TBL)  

In finance, when speaking of a company's bottom line, we usually mean its profits. Elkington's TBL framework advances the goal of sustainability in business practices, in which companies look beyond profits to include social and environmental issues to measure the full cost of doing business. Triple-bottom-line theory says that companies should focus as much attention on social and environmental issues as they do on financial issues.



TBL theory also says that if a company focuses on finances only and does not examine how it interacts socially, it is not able to see the whole picture and therefore cannot account for the full cost of doing business.


   The 3 Ps of the Triple Bottom Line  

According to TBL theory, companies should be working simultaneously on these three bottom lines:



Profit: This is the traditional measure of corporate profit—the profit and loss (P&L) account.
People: This measures how socially responsible an organization has been throughout its history.
Planet: This measures how environmentally responsible a firm has been.


  Profit  

In the context of the triple bottom line, profit can mean more than just how much money a company makes. A company must ensure it earns its income in ethical, fair manners. This includes soliciting business partners and vendors with which it aligns philanthropically. It also defines how a company develops its strategy or financial operating plan. For instance, profit also ties to a company's responsibility to pay its lenders, creditors, and employees what is due to them and to have a sense of financial responsibility for these obligations.



Some users of the triple bottom line may also say profit refers to not only a company's profit but the profit of those around the company. This specifically refers to the community in which the business operates. This may include:



Ensuring the company is paying its fair share of local, state, or federal income taxes on a timely basis
Making sure the company is fostering economic wealth within its community by shopping local or utilizing small businesses. 
Committing to financially investing in the community through partnerships, developments, or corporate sponsorships.


  People  

In the context of triple bottom line, people refers to every individual that is in touch with a company. This includes but is not limited to:



Employees. This means ensuring workers receive a fair wage in a safe environment that encourages professional development. Vendors. This means ensuring a diverse set of suppliers are used and prioritizing small businesses or minority-owners when appropriate.Customers. This means ensuring customers have fair access to products and their feedback regarding equity or safety are considered.



Traditionally, a company would prioritize investors or shareholders. Triple bottom line shifts the focus to individuals potentially not financially invested in the company but still tangentially involved with its operations. Now, instead of attempting to create value by only increasing investor returns, triple bottom line strives to create value by encouraging volunteerism of its employees or support or business success of small suppliers, for example.


  Planet  

The largest deviation from purely financial reporting relates to reporting on environmental impacts. Often, a company must be forced between a lower-cost option or a more environmentally-friendly alternative. A company may also choose between a less favorable alternative; for example, eco-friendly transit will likely be slower than aircraft.



Instead of reporting a company's positive changes to the planet, it is often much easier to assess the impacts of the alternatives elected by the company. Imagine a company that redesigned its distribution channels to reduce its energy use; such an activity would be reported as saving a certain amount of greenhouse gas emissions.






Some users of triple bottom line may replace 'profit' with 'prosperity'; both terms are meant to be interchangeable and refer to the long-term health of the company and its programs.


   How to Measure the Triple Bottom Line  

Companies may need to get creative when measuring the triple bottom line. Traditional accounting rules provide very strong guidance on how a company must record its accounting profit. Alternatively, there may be minimal to no structure in place on how a company must measure its triple bottom line, especially considering there may be no external reporting requirement to do so.


  Measuring Profit  

A company will still usually report company-wide net income as part of its triple bottom line. For this reason, profit is the easiest component of triple bottom line to report as it already has strong guidance. However, it may also report or call out several other profitability or financial metrics such as:



Gross margin by geographical region to demonstrate consistent or equitable pricing across different demographic groups.Historical federal income tax payments, demonstrating its effective rate.Historical information (or lack of) late payments or penalties as a demonstration of financial responsibility. 


  Measuring People  

Also referred to as social measures or social metrics, the people component of triple bottom line may contain financial or non-financial measurements. Again, some may be stipulated by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) or other reporting rules, while others may be internally-sourced data. Examples of measurements of people include:



Average employee payroll to demonstrate livable wages that exceed local expectations for pay.
Average employee benefits per employee beyond pay to demonstrate the full benefit package per worker.
Average number of vacation hours earned and used per employee to ensure workers can and have been stepping away from work.
Employment demographics such as proportion of employees in different age, race, sexual orientation, or religious groups. Note that some of this information may be sensitive and must be provided voluntarily by employees (as employers are not entitled to some demographic information.
Vendor demographics such as businesses identifying as small businesses, LGBTQ-owned, Veteran-owned, or minority-owned.
Number of product returns by geographical regions to ensure certain demographics are still receiving quality products.


  Measuring Planet  

Perhaps the most difficult triple bottom line component to measure is planet. As a company may need to know its existing impact as well as its "eco-friendly" impact, measuring impacts to the planet may require the most expertise or effort. However, there are very common environmental measurements such as:



Reductions in greenhouse gas emissions based on the difference between former processes and forecasted changes in new processes.
Amount of waste generated in pounds; this may also include amount of recycled product over a period of time.
Amount of energy consumption, adjusted for seasonality. 
Amount of fossil fuel consumption (may be adjusted for per-employee or per-sales lead should the company be growing).
Proportion of raw materials sourced ethically.






To promote each category as being equally important to one another, a true triple bottom report will have a consistent number of measurements for profit, people, and planet.


   Advantages and Disadvantages of the Triple Bottom Line  
  Advantages of Applying the Triple Bottom Line  

The obvious reason to apply the triple bottom line is to have a greater positive impact on the world. Instead of focusing on paper profit, companies can quantifiably determine how the business is favorably changing the world and the people it engages with.



Having a greater philanthropic presence may encourage employee retention and decrease attrition. Workers may be more likely to commit to a company if its environmental impacts are communicated. In addition, favorable working conditions including competitive wages, training, and time off to volunteer may keep employees around; this may reduce recruiting, training, onboarding, and general costs of new employees.



A greater triple bottom line plan may also entice customers and consciously capitalistic investors interested in prioritizing certain non-financial metrics over financial metrics. Some customers may be torn between two similar products; the deciding factor may be the ESG prioritization of the companies. In addition, investors may actively seek to put their money into a company that has social and environmental plans.



Last, triple bottom-line strategies may result in increased long-term profitability. Though short-term costs may increase, a company may become more efficient in the long run. Consider a company converting its fleet to electric vehicles. Short-term, this will be a massive capital investment. In the long term, the company may reap the benefit of lower energy costs, less maintenance, or better equipment durability.


  Disadvantages of Applying the Triple Bottom Line  

A key challenge of the triple bottom line is the difficulty of measuring certain social and environmental bottom lines. Profitability is inherently quantitative, so it is easy to measure. However, consider the example of attempting to evaluate the economic impact of preventing an oil spill. A company may easily be able identify the input costs, but it may be more difficult to pinpoint non-financial inputs or outcomes.



It can also be difficult to switch gears between priorities that are seemingly antithetical—such as maximizing individual financial returns while also doing the greatest good for society. Some companies might struggle to balance deploying money and other resources, such as human capital, to all three bottom lines without favoring one at the expense of another.



In addition, electing to prioritize the triple bottom line will likely be more expensive. Consider a clothing manufacturer whose best way to maximize profits might be to hire the least expensive labor possible and to dispose of manufacturing waste in the cheapest way possible. These practices might well result in the greatest possible profits for the company but at the expense of miserable working and living conditions for laborers, and harm to the natural environment and the people who live in that environment.





Pros

Aims to have positive impact on the world
May boost employee retention as workers may appreciate favorable working conditions
May result in greater external funds from investors seeking ESG investments
May result in greater sales from customers seeking to support ESG companies
May result in long-term efficiencies that reduce costs in the long-run



Cons

May be more difficult to assess non-financial inputs or outputs
Lack of comparability across impact groups (i.e. companies may need to choose one bottom line over the other)
May result in competing strategies, making it difficult to easily pivot from one plan to another
Will likely increase the cost of operations due to needing to find alternative products or processes





   Examples of Companies That Subscribe to TBL or Similar Concepts  

Today, the corporate world is more conscious than ever of its social and environmental responsibility. Companies are increasingly adopting or ramping up their social programs. Consumers want companies to be transparent about their practices and to be considerate of all stakeholders. Many consumers are willing to pay more for clothing and other products if it means that workers are paid a living wage and the environment is being respected in the production process.



The number of firms—of all types and sizes, both publicly and privately held—that subscribe to the triple-bottom-line concept, or something similar, is staggering. Here are a handful of these companies:


  Ben & Jerry's  

Ben & Jerry's is the ice cream company that made conscious capitalism central to its strategy. As stated on its website, "Ben & Jerry's is founded on and dedicated to a sustainable corporate concept of linked prosperity." The company opposes the use of recombinant bovine growth hormone (rBGH) and genetically modified organisms (GMOs) and fosters myriad values such as fair trade and climate justice.


  LEGO  

The LEGO Group (privately held; Billund, Denmark) has formed partnerships with organizations like the nongovernmental organization (NGO) World Wildlife Fund. In addition, LEGO has made a commitment to reducing its carbon footprint and is working towards 100% renewable energy capacity by 2030.






In addition to partnering with the World Wildlife Fund, the LEGO Group has also pledged to transition to renewable bioplastics. The first plant-derived set of LEGO toys was launched in 2019.


  Mars  

Mars Incorporated (privately held; McLean, Va.) has a sustainable cocoa initiative called Cocoa for Generations. It requires cocoa farmers to be fair trade certified to ensure they follow a code of fair treatment to workers providing labor. In exchange for certification, Mars provides productivity technology and buys cocoa at premium prices.


  Starbucks  

Starbucks Corporation (SBUX), has been socially and environmentally focused since its inception in 1971. The company has hired more than 30,000 veterans since 2013 and is committed to hiring 5,000 more per year going forward.




What Are the 3 Elements of the Triple Bottom Line (TBL)?
The triple bottom line is an accounting framework that incorporates three dimensions of performance: social, environmental, and financial. These three facets can be summarized as "people, planet, and profit."




How Is TBL Different From the Financial Bottom Line?
Including social, human, and environmental capital along with a company's financial capital makes it possible to get a more accurate picture of a company's impact on society. While a company's financial line is helpful in knowing the profitability of the company, a company's triple bottom line is used to evaluate non-financial, philanthrophic performance.




Who Came Up With the Triple Bottom Line?
The triple bottom line was conceived by entrepreneur and business writer John Elkington in 1994 while at the think tank SustainAbility, and it was later incorporated into the oil company Shell's first sustainability report in 1997.




Why Is the Triple Bottom Line Important?
A company's triple bottom line is important because it de-prioritizes the importance of financial performance. This alternative reporting metric encourages companies to set social, environmental, philanthropic, and non-financial goals instead of purely making decisions on what will maximize profit. In addition, triple bottom line is important for investors considering what companies invest in. Some may elect to invest in companies that may be reporting less financial profit but yielding stronger philanthropic results.


   The Bottom Line  

As companies commit more resources to social and environmental impacts instead of prioritizing profit, the company can report their achievements using the triple bottom line. This reporting structure demonstrates successes relating to profit, people, and the plant and quantifies results beyond a company's net income. Management, regulators, and investors may be interested in knowing how a company has performed not just selling product but making the world a better place.
What Is the Triple Exponential Moving Average (TEMA)?  

The triple exponential moving average (TEMA) was designed to smooth price fluctuations, thereby making it easier to identify trends without the lag associated with traditional moving averages (MA). It does this by taking multiple exponential moving averages (EMA) of the original EMA and subtracting out some of the lag.



The TEMA is used like other MAs. It can help identify trend direction, signal potential short-term trend changes or pullbacks, and provide support or resistance. The TEMA can be compared with the double exponential moving average (DEMA).





Key Takeaways

The triple exponential moving average (TEMA) uses multiple EMA calculations and subtracts out the lag to create a trend following indicator that reacts quickly to price changes.The TEMA can help identify trend direction, signal potential short-term trend changes or pullbacks, and provide support or resistance.When the price is above the TEMA it helps confirm an uptrend; when the price is below the TEMA it helps confirm a downtrend.

Choose a lookback period. This is how many periods will be factored into the first EMA. With a fewer number of periods, such as 10, the EMA will track price closely and highlight short-term trends. With a larger lookback period, such as 100, the EMA will not track price as closely and will highlight the longer-term trend.
Calculate the EMA for the lookback period. This is EMA1.
Calculate the EMA of EMA1, using the same lookback period. For example, if using 15 periods for EMA1, use 15 in this step as well. This is EMA2.
Calculate the EMA of EMA2, using the same lookback period as before.
Plug EMA1, EMA2, and EMA3 into the TEMA formula to calculate the triple exponential moving average.


   What Does the TEMA Tell You?  

The TEMA reacts to price changes quicker than a traditional MA or EMA will. This is because some of the lag has been subtracted out in the calculation.



A TEMA can be used in the same ways as other types of MAs. Mainly, the direction the TEMA is angled indicates the short-term (averaged) price direction. When the line is sloping up, that means the price is moving up. When it is angled down, the price is moving down.



There is still a small amount of lag in the indicator, so when prices change quickly the indicator may not change its angle immediately. Also, the larger the lookback period, the slower the TEMA will be in changing its angle when price changes direction.


   The TEMA and Trend Direction  

The location of the TEMA relative to the price also provides clues as to the trend direction. Generally, when the price is above the TEMA it helps confirm the price is rising for that lookback period. When the price is below the TEMA, it helps confirm the price is falling for that lookback period.



That said, a lookback period should be chosen so this actually holds true most of the time. Therefore, it is up to the trader to choose the appropriate lookback period for the asset they are trading if they intend to use the TEMA for helping to identify trends.



If the TEMA can help identify trend direction, then it can also help identify trend changes. If the price is above the average, and then drops below, that could signal the uptrend is reversing, or at least that the price is entering a pullback phase. If the price is below the average, and then moves above it, that signals the price is rallying. Such crossover signals may be used to aid in deciding whether to enter or exit positions.


   The TEMA for Support and Resistance  

The TEMA may also provide support or resistance for the price. For example, when the price is rising overall, on pullbacks it may drop to the TEMA, and then the price may appear to bounce off of it and keep rising. This movement is reliant upon the proper lookback period for the asset. If using the TEMA for this purpose, it should have already provided support and resistance in the past. If the indicator didn't provide support or resistance in the past, it probably won't in the future.



Finally, some traders use the TEMA, typically with a small lookback period, as an alternative to price itself. The single line filters out much of the noise on traditional candlestick or bar charts. A line chart would also work in this regard.


   The TEMA vs. the Double Exponential Moving Average (DEMA)  

Both these indicators are designed to reduce the lag inherent in average-based indicators. The TEMA reduces lag more than the double exponential moving average (DEMA).



The formula for the DEMA is different, which means it will provide the trader with slightly different information and signals. It is calculated by multiplying the EMA of price by two and then subtracting an EMA of the original EMA.


   Limitations of Using the TEMA  

While the TEMA reduces lag, it still inherits some of the traditional problems of other MAs. MAs are primarily useful in trending markets, when the price is making sustained moves in one direction or the other. During choppy times, when the price is seesawing back and forth, the MA or TEMA may provide little insight and will generate false signals since crossovers may not result in a sustained move as long as the price stays rangebound.



Reduced lag may benefit some traders, but not others. Some traders prefer their indicators to lag because they don't want their indicator reacting to every price change. Since the TEMA reacts quicker to price changes, it will track the price more closely than a simple moving average (SMA), for example. But that also means that the price may cross the TEMA on a smaller price move than what is required to cross the SMA. Investors typically don't want to actively trade, so they don't wish to be shaken out of positions unless there is a significant trend change.



One type of MA is not better than another. Deciding which to use comes down to personal preference and what works best for the strategy someone is using.



The TEMA is best used in conjunction with other forms of analysis, such as price action analysis, other technical indicators, and fundamental analysis.


   Example of the TEMA  

Here's an example of a TEMA applied to the SPDR S&P 500 ETF.

The TEMA smooths out the price action. The angle of the TEMA helps identify the overall trend direction even during the day-to-day noise of minor price fluctuations.
What Is a Triple Net Lease (NNN)?  

A triple net lease (triple-net or NNN) is a lease agreement on a property whereby the tenant or lessee promises to pay all the expenses of the property, including real estate taxes, building insurance, and maintenance. These expenses are in addition to the cost of rent and utilities. In contrast, in standard commercial lease agreements, some or all of these payments are typically the responsibility of the landlord.



NNNs are just one type of commercial property net lease. A single net lease requires tenants to pay property taxes in addition to rent, and a double net lease typically tacks on property insurance.





Key Takeaways

With a triple net lease (NNN), the tenant agrees to pay the property expenses such as real estate taxes, building insurance, and maintenance in addition to rent and utilities.Triple net leases are commonly found in commercial real estate.Triple net leases tend to have lower rents because the tenant assumes ongoing expenses that would otherwise be the responsibility of the property owner.Other net leases are a single net lease, in which the tenant pays property taxes, and a double net lease, which includes property taxes and property insurance.Triple net leased properties have become popular investment vehicles for investors because they provide low-risk, steady income.

   Understanding Triple Net Leases (NNN)  

In commercial real estate, a net lease is a lease in which the tenant is required to pay a portion, or all, of the taxes, fees, and maintenance costs for a property.



If a property owner leases out a building to a business using a triple net lease, the tenant is responsible for paying the building's property taxes, building insurance, and the cost of any maintenance or repairs the building may require for the term of the lease. Because the tenant is covering these costs, which would otherwise be the responsibility of the property owner, the rent charged in the triple net lease is generally lower than the rent charged in a standard lease agreement. The capitalization rate ("cap rate") is the expected rate of return on a commercial property. The cap rate, which is used to calculate the lease amount, is often determined, in part, by the creditworthiness of the tenant.


   Advantages and Disadvantages of Triple Net Leases  

The main advantage of triple net leases for both tenants and landlords is that they are simple to understand and easy to manage since the tenant is responsible for all operating expenses, but they may present some inconveniences too.


  Pros of Triple Net Leases  

For tenants:



The tenant has total control over the maintenance, upkeep, and appearance of theproperty.The tenants also have direct control over the costs they pay, such as electricity or water. They can also select the insurance carrier of their preference and can protest the taxes if necessary to keep them as low as possible.



For landlords: 



A triple net lease is a steady and consistent revenue stream.A triple net lease involves less management hassle since utility expenses, repair costs, taxes, and any property management costs and issues are the responsibilities of the tenant. This leaves the landlord more time to focus on their primary business.


  Cons of Triple Net Leases  

For tenants: 



The tenant assumes the risk of property tax and any increase in the price of insurance. They also assume any cost involved in maintaining the property.The landlord might overestimate the operating costs when determining the rental price, which results in the tenant overpaying for some of the costs.Tenants might invest some work and time in property management, from hiring repair companies to comparing and buying insurance and protesting taxes if needed.Some unexpected costs (in maintenance or tax liabilities, for example) may arise during the time of occupancy.



For landlords: 



Finding good and reliable tenants who are willing to sign a triple net lease could be a challenge. Another factor to consider is the downtime in between tenants, which could result in no rental income while the building is vacant.The tenant credit risk should be a concern for landlords. The tenant's financial strength and stability are key since they are responsible for operating expenses.


   Triple Net Leases vs. Single Net Leases and Double Net Leases  

Triple net leases NNNs are just one type of commercial net lease.



Single net (N) leases are not as common. Here, the landlord transfers a minimal amount of risk to the tenant, who pays just the property taxes.



Double net (NN) leases are also common in commercial real estate. In a lease like this, the tenant pays two instead of three obligations: property taxes and insurance premiums in addition to the rent. The base rent—payable for the space itself—is generally lower because of the additional expenses the tenant must bear. All maintenance costs, on the other hand, remain the responsibility of the landlord, who pays for them directly.


   Investing in Triple Net Leases  

Triple net leased properties have become popular investment vehicles for investors seeking steady income with relatively low risk. Triple net lease investments typically consist of a portfolio of three or more high-grade commercial properties fully leased by a single tenant with existing in-place cash flow. The commercial properties could include office buildings, shopping malls, industrial parks, or free-standing buildings operated by banks, pharmacies, or restaurant chains. The typical lease term is for 10 to 15 years, with built-in contractual rent escalation.






Commercial property is real estate that is used for business activities or profit-generating purposes. It usually refers to buildings that house businesses, but can also refer to land used to generate a profit, as well as large residential rental properties.



The benefits for investors include long-term, stable income with the possibility of capital appreciation of the underlying property. Investors can invest in high-quality real estate without management concerns like vacancies, improvement costs, or leasing fees. When the underlying properties are sold, investors can roll their capital into another triple-net-lease investment without paying taxes through a 1031 tax-deferred exchange.



Investors in triple net lease investment offerings must be accredited with a net worth of at least $1 million excluding the value of their primary residence or $200,000 in income ($300,000 for joint filers). Smaller investors may participate in triple net lease real estate by investing in real estate investment trusts (REITs) that focus on such properties in their portfolios.

Is a Triple Net Lease a Good Idea?
For both tenants and landlords, triple net leases can offer some benefits. A tenant has more freedom with their structure; they can customize their space for more brand uniformity without the capital investment of a purchase. Another advantage is that these leases tend to be quite flexible: caps on tax increases, insurance increases, etc. For the landlord, triple net leases can be a reliable source of income and have very few overhead costs. The landlord also does not have to play an active role in the management of the property.




Can You Negotiate a Triple Net Lease?
With a triple net lease, almost all responsibilities fall on the tenant. The tenant is responsible for paying rent, as well as all overhead costs associated with owning the property: taxes, insurance, operating expenses, utilities, etc. As a result, the base rental amount can become a key negotiating term. Because the tenant is taking on the risk of the landlord's overhead, they may be able to negotiate a more favorable base rental amount. Also, in some cases, tenants can negotiate what aspects of repair costs and/or utilities the landlord is responsible for.




Do I Have to Worry About Paying Net Lease Obligations on the Apartment I Rent?
Probably not. Net leases are most commonly used in commercial real estate and not for residential units. Residential tenants may be required to pay some or all of their utilities, and will often be encouraged to purchase their own renter's insurance. A residential landlord, however, would typically pay for the property and liability insurance and real estate taxes.




How Do You Calculate a Triple Net Lease?
There are various ways that the amount of a triple net lease can be calculated. Sometimes landlords will add up all the property taxes, insurance, maintenance expenses, and common area expenses for a building and divide the total by 12. This number is the monthly cost. This process is simplified when only one tenant is leasing a building. The monthly base rental amount is typically calculated based on a rate per square footage.




What Is the Landlord Responsible for in a Triple Net Lease?
The tenant is responsible for most expenses related to a commercial property with a triple net lease. However, the landlord may be responsible for the roof and the structure, and sometimes the parking lot.


   The Bottom Line  

A triple net lease can be a good option since this type of lease offer both landlords and tenants several advantages and can benefit both parties. While landlords can hand off paying various property expenses, enjoy a stable source of income, and are able to focus on their own business, tenants, on the other hand, can receive a lower monthly rent.



Nevertheless, landlords and tenants alike should explore other types of leases, including single net leases and double net leases
What Is a Triple Top?  

The triple top is a type of chart pattern used in technical analysis to predict the reversal in the movement of an asset's price. Consisting of three peaks, a triple top signals that the asset may no longer be rallying, and that lower prices may be on the way.



In order for the pattern to be considered a triple top, it must occur after an uptrend. The opposite of a triple is a triple bottom, which indicates the asset's price is no longer falling and could head higher.





Key Takeaways

A triple top is formed by three peaks moving into the same area, with pullbacks in between.A triple top is considered complete, indicating a further price slide, once the price moves below pattern support.A trader exits longs or enters shorts when the triple top completes.If trading the pattern, a stop loss can be placed above resistance (peaks).The estimated downside target for the pattern is the height of the pattern subtracted from the breakout point.






   How a Triple Top Works  

The triple top pattern occurs when the price of an asset creates three peaks at nearly the same price level. The area of the peaks is resistance. The pullbacks between the peaks are called the swing lows. After the third peak, if the price falls below the swing lows, the pattern is considered complete and traders watch for a further move to the downside.



The three consecutive peaks make the triple top visually similar to the head and shoulders pattern; however, in this case, the middle peak is nearly equal to the other peaks rather than being higher. The pattern is also similar to the double top pattern, when the price touches the resistance area twice, creating a pair of high points before falling.






Triple tops are traded in essentially the same way as head and shoulders patterns.



Say a stock's price peaks at $119, pulls back to $110, rallies to $119.25, pulls back to $111, rallies to $118, then drops below $111, that is a triple top and signals the stock is likely heading lower. It would look like the chart below.

   Significance of the Triple Top  

Technically, a triple top pattern shows us that the price is unable to penetrate the area of the peaks. Translated into real-life events, it means that, after multiple attempts, the asset is unable to find many buyers in that price range.



As the price falls, it puts pressure on all those traders who bought during the pattern to start selling. If the price can't rise above resistance there is limited profit potential in holding onto it. As the price falls below the swing lows of the pattern, selling may escalate as former buyers exit losing long positions and new traders jump into short positions. This is the psychology of the pattern, and what helps fuel the selloff after the pattern completes.



No pattern works all the time. Sometimes a triple top will form and complete, leading traders to believe the asset will continue to fall. But then, the price may then recover and move above the resistance area.



For protection, a trader could place a stop loss on short positions above the latest peak, or above a recent swing high within the pattern. This move limits the risk of the trade if the price doesn't drop and instead rallies.


   Trading Triple Top Patterns  

Some traders will enter into a short position, or exit long positions, once the price of the asset falls below pattern support. The support level of the pattern is the most recent swing low following the second peak, or alternatively, a trader could connect the swing lows between the peaks with a trendline. When the price falls below the trendline the pattern is considered complete and a further decline in price is expected.



To add confirmation to the pattern, traders will watch for heavy volume as the price falls through support. Volume should pick up showing a strong interest in selling. If the volume doesn't increase, the pattern is more prone to failure (price rallying or not falling as expected).



The pattern provides a downside target equal to the height of the pattern subtracted from the breakout point. This target is an estimate. Sometimes the price will drop much lower than the target, other times it won't reach the target.



Other technical indicators and chart patterns may also be used in conjunction with the triple top. For example, a trader may watch for a bearish MACD crossover following the third peak, or for the RSI to drop out of overbought territory to help confirm the price drop.


   Real-World Example of a Triple Top  

The following chart shows an example of a triple top in Bruker Corp. (BRKR). The price reaches near $36.50 on three consecutive attempts. The price pulls back between each attempt, creating the triple top pattern. The stock quickly broke below trendline support at $34 and continued to decline on escalating volume.












Image by Sabrina Jiang © Investopedia 2021



Traders could enter short or exit longs when the price drops below support at $34. A stop-loss could initially be placed just above the major resistance area.



The estimated target for the decline is the height of the pattern, about $3.25, subtracted from the $34 breakout point. Therefore, the target is $30.75. The target was reached before the price started bouncing, although that won't always happen.


   Special Considerations for a Triple Top  

As with double tops and bottoms, the risk/reward ratio is a drawback of these triple patterns. Since both the stop loss and target are based on the height of the pattern, they are roughly equal. Patterns in which the potential profit is greater than the risk are preferred by most professional traders.



By placing the stop loss within the pattern, instead of above it (triple top) or below it (triple bottom) improves the reward relative to the risk. The risk is based on only a portion of the pattern height, while the target is based on the full pattern height.



Depending on which entry points are used—the trendline or the recent pullback low—it is possible to have two profit targets since the height of the pattern can be added to either of these breakout points. Traders can choose which target breakout level they prefer in order to extract more profit from the trade.




Is a Triple Top Bullish or Bearish?
The triple top is a bearish reversal chart pattern that leads to the trend change to the downside. On the other hand, the triple bottom pattern is a bullish reversal chart pattern that leads to the trend change to the upside.




Are Triple Tops Rare?
Triple top patterns occur less frequently than double top patterns, where there is one peak less to happen. But the fact that it is a rare chart formation is also the biggest weakness of a triple top.




How Long Does the Triple Top Pattern Take to Form?
As other major reversal patterns, the triple top pattern usually form over a three- to six- month period.


   The Bottom Line  

The triple top is used in technical analysis to predict the reversal in the movement of an asset's price. A triple top occurs when the price peaks, retraces, rallies to a similar peak, retraces, rallies to a similar high again then declines again.



A triple top is considered complete once the price moves below pattern support and the trend changes to the downside. Then, a trader may decide to exit longs or enter shorts.



The triple bottom chart pattern is an upside-down version of the triple top and marks the end of a downtrend.
What Is Triple Witching?  

Triple witching is the simultaneous expiration of stock options, stock index futures, and stock index options contracts all on the same trading day. This happens four times a year: on the third Friday of March, June, September, and December. A common expiration date for the three types of equities derivatives can cause increased trading volume and unusual price action in the underlying assets.





Key Takeaways

Triple witching is the expiration on the same day of stock options, stock index futures, and stock index options contracts.Triple witching occurs quarterly—on the third Friday of March, June, September, and December.Triple witching days can see increased trading activity as traders close, roll out, or offset their expiring positions, particularly in the final hour of trading.


   Understanding Triple Witching  

Triple witching days generate trading activity and volatility because contracts that are allowed to expire may necessitate the purchase or sale of the underlying security. While some derivative contracts are opened with the intention of buying or selling the underlying security, traders seeking derivative exposure only must close, roll out, or offset their open positions prior to the close of trading on triple witching days.



Triple witching days, particularly the final hour of trading preceding the closing bell, known as the triple witching hour, can result in escalated trading activity and volatility as traders close, roll out, or offset their expiring positions.



Single stock futures, last traded in the U.S. in 2020, were often grouped with stock options, index options, and index futures, giving rise to the term "quadruple witching." But they never drew nearly as much capital or trading interest as the other types of equities derivatives, most notably stock options.


   Offsetting Futures Positions  

A futures contract, which is an agreement to buy or sell an underlying security at a predetermined price on a specified day, mandates that the agreed-upon transaction take place after the expiration of the contract.



For example, one E-mini S&P 500 futures contract is valued at 50 times the value of the index. If the S&P 500 is at 4,000 at expiration, the value of the contract is $200,000, which is the amount the contract owner is obligated to pay if the contract is allowed to expire.



To avoid this obligation, the contract owner closes the contract by selling it prior to expiration. After closing the expiring contract, exposure to the S&P 500 index can be maintained by purchasing a new contract in a forward month. This is referred to as rolling out a contract. Much of the action surrounding futures and options on triple witching days are focused on offsetting, closing, or rolling out positions.



On the expiration date, contract owners can choose not to take delivery and instead close their contracts by booking an offsetting trade at the prevailing price, settling the gain or loss from the purchase and sale prices.



Traders can also extend the contract by offsetting the existing trade and simultaneously booking a new option or futures contract to be settled in the future—a process called rolling the contracts forward.


   Expiring Options  

Options that are in the money (ITM) present a similar situation for holders of expiring contracts. For example, the seller of a covered call option can have the underlying shares called away if the share price closes above the strike price of the expiring option.



In this situation, the option seller has the option to close the position prior to expiration to continue holding the shares or allow the option to expire and have the shares called away.



Call options expire in the money and are profitable when the price of the underlying security is higher than the strike price in the contract. Put options are in the money when the stock or index is priced below the strike price. In both situations, the expiration of in-the-money options results in automatic transactions between the buyers and sellers of the contracts. As a result, triple witching dates lead to an increased amount of these transactions being completed.


   Triple Witching and Arbitrage  

Though much of the trading in closing, opening, and offsetting futures and options contracts during triple witching days is related to the squaring of positions, the surge of activity can also drive price inefficiencies, which draws short-term arbitrageurs.



These opportunities are often the catalysts for heavy volume going into the close on triple witching days as traders attempt to profit on small price imbalances with large round-trip trades that may be completed in seconds.






Despite the overall increase in trading volume, triple witching days do not necessarily lead to heavy volatility.


   Real-World Example of Triple Witching  

Friday, March 15, 2019, was the first triple witching day of 2019. Trading volume leading up to this third Friday of the month saw increased market activity. According to a Reuters report, trading volume on March 15, 2019, on U.S. market exchanges was "10.8 billion shares, compared to the 7.5 billion average" over the past 20 trading days.



For the week leading into triple witching Friday, the S&P 500 was up 2.9% while the Nasdaq was up 3.8%, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) was up 1.6%. However, it appears much of the gains happened before triple witching Friday because the S&P was only up by 0.50% while the Dow was only up 0.54% Friday.


   Frequently Asked Questions  


What Is Witching and Why Is It Triple?
In folklore, the witching hour is a supernatural time of day when evil things may be afoot. In derivatives trading, this has colloquially applied to the hour of contract expiration, often on a Friday at the close of trading.On triple witching, three different types of contracts expire simultaneously: listed index options, single-stock options, and index futures.




When Does Triple Witching Occur?
Triple witching usually occurs on the third Friday of March, June, September, and December, at market close (4:00 p.m. EST).




Why Do Traders Care About Triple Witching?
Because several derivatives expire at the same moment, traders will often seek to close out all of their open positions in advance of expiration. This can lead to increased trading volume and intraday volatility. Traders with large short gamma positions are particularly exposed to price movements leading up to expiration. Arbitrageurs try to take advantage of such abnormal price action, but doing so can also be quite risky.




What Are Some Price Abnormalities Observed on Triple Witching?
Because traders will try to close or roll over their positions, trading volume is usually above average on triple witching, which can lead to greater volatility. However, one interesting phenomenon observed is that the price of a security may artificially tend toward a strike price with large open interest as gamma hedging takes place.This can lead the price to "pin" the strike at expiration due to this sort of trading activity. Pinning a strike imposes pin risk for options traders, wherein they become uncertain as to whether or not they should exercise their long options that have expired in the money or very close to it. This is because, at the same time, they are unsure as to how many of their similar short positions they will be assigned.
What Was the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP)?  

The Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) was an initiative created and run by the U.S. Treasury to stabilize the country’s financial system, restore economic growth, and mitigate foreclosures in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis. TARP sought to achieve these targets by purchasing troubled companies’ assets and stock.





Key Takeaways

The Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) was instituted by the U.S. Treasury following the 2008 financial crisis.TARP stabilized the financial system by having the government buy mortgage-backed securities and bank stocks.From 2008 to 2010, TARP invested $426.4 billion in firms and recouped $441.7 billion in return.TARP was controversial at the time, and its effectiveness continues to be debated.


   How the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) Worked  

Global credit markets came to a near standstill in September 2008 as several major financial institutions, such as Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and American International Group (AIG), experienced severe financial problems. Lehman Brothers went bankrupt, and investment companies Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley changed their charters to become commercial banks in an attempt to stabilize their capital situations.



To prevent the situation from completely spiraling out of control, Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson pioneered the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP). It was signed into law by President George W. Bush on October 3, 2008, with the passage of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act.

TARP's original purpose was to increase the liquidity of the money markets and secondary mortgage markets by purchasing the mortgage-backed securities (MBS), and through that, reduce the potential losses of the institutions that owned them.



Later, TARP's aim was modified slightly to allow the government to buy equity in banks and other financial institutions. TARP initially gave the Treasury purchasing power of $700 billion; the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (simply referred to as Dodd-Frank) later reduced the $700 billion authorization to $475 billion.






TARP funds were used to purchase stock in banks, insurance companies, and auto-makers, and to loan funds to financial institutions and homeowners.



The U.S. government bought preferred stock in eight banks: Bank of America/Merrill Lynch, Bank of New York Mellon, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, J.P. Morgan, Morgan Stanley, State Street, and Wells Fargo. The banks were required to give the government a 5% dividend that would increase to 9% in 2013, encouraging banks to buy back the stock within five years.



From the program’s inception until October 3, 2010 (the deadline for extending funds), $245 billion was used to stabilize banks, $27 billion went to programs to increase credit availability, $80 billion went to the U.S. auto industry (specifically, GM and Chrysler), $68 billion was used to stabilize AIG, and $46 billion went to foreclosure-prevention programs, such as Making Home Affordable.



The provisions of TARP demanded that companies involved lose certain tax benefits and, in many cases, placed limits on executive compensation and forbade fund recipients from awarding bonuses to their top 25 highest-paid executives. Even so, by 2009, bailed-out firms paid some $20 billion to key personnel—sardonically referred to as TARP bonuses.


  The Legacy of TARP  

When the Treasury wrapped up TARP, the government concluded that its investments had earned more than $11 billion for taxpayers by 2010. To be more specific, TARP recovered funds totaling $441.7 billion from $426.4 billion invested. The government also claimed that TARP prevented the American auto industry from failing and saved more than one million jobs, helped stabilize banks, and restored credit availability for individuals and businesses.






TARP is still controversial. Advocates say it saved the U.S. financial system and shortened the financial crisis while critics charge the initiative just gave Wall Street an unnecessary boost.



Even so, economists, politicians, and financial professionals still debate TARP's merits and wonder if it had been necessary. Critics charge the program did little to help the housing markets, which remained depressed for years. Some say it did not go far enough—that the government should have insisted on an equity stake in the financial firms it was bailing out to control their future practices.



Instead, critics opine that TARP's no-strings loans essentially acted as a reward for bad behavior, sending a message of "act irresponsibly and we'll help you out"—and establishing a dangerous precedent of dependency.



TARP also did not endear the government to the American public, which saw Wall Street reap benefits—including those notorious bonuses—and return to profitability, even as individuals struggled with debt, unemployment, and foreclosures in the wake of the Great Recession.
What Is a Trough?  

A trough, in economic terms, can refer to a stage in the business cycle where activity is bottoming, or where prices are bottoming, before a rise.





Key Takeaways

A trough, in economic terms, can refer to a stage in the business cycle where activity is bottoming, or where prices are bottoming, before a rise.The business cycle is the upward and downward movement of gross domestic product (GDP) and consists of recessions and expansions that end in peaks and troughs.A trough is marked by conditions like higher unemployment, layoffs, declining business sales and earnings, and lower credit availability.After the trough, recovery and expansion begin.The actual trough can only be identified in hindsight.

   Understanding Troughs  

The business cycle moves in five phases: expansion, peak, contraction, trough, and recovery. The trough is the bottoming process of moving from contraction, or declining business activity, to recovery, which is increasing business activity. Economists use several metrics to track the economic cycle throughout its various phases. The most recognizable of these is gross domestic product (GDP), which is the total value of all goods and services that a country produces.



A trough is the stage of the economy's business cycle that marks the end of a period of declining business activity and the transition to expansion. The business cycle is the upward and downward movement of gross domestic product and consists of recessions and expansions that end in peaks and troughs.



Employment levels also offer an indicator of where the economy stands in the business cycle. Unemployment levels of less than 5% are consistent with full employment and are indicative of economic expansion. When the unemployment rate rises from month to month, the economy has most likely entered a contractionary phase. When the unemployment rate bottoms out, a trough has likely occurred. Income and wages are also indicators of where the economy stands in the business cycle. These increase during expansion, recede during contraction, and bottom out during a trough.



The major U.S. stock market indices, such as the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) and Standard & Poor's 500 Index (S&P 500) also track closely with the business cycle. Declines in the stock market coincide or foreshadow contraction in the economy. When stocks rally after a significant decline, it could signal the economic trough is in, or coming soon, leading to a rise in economic activity.






Troughs are usually only apparent in hindsight.


   Special Considerations  

Troughs are recognizable in hindsight, but harder to spot in real-time. As the economic indicators contract, the economy is in a contraction phase. This phase can last for a short or long period of time. It is only once the economic activity begins to increase again, as shown on economic indicators, that expansion is likely underway and the trough (or bottom) has been put in.



While troughs vary in severity—with some troughs only being minor setbacks in economic growth, and others being sustained periods of hardship—they are typically marked with declining business sales and earnings, layoffs, low credit availability, higher unemployment, and business closures (all compared to the other business cycle phases). Troughs are important as they mark a positive turning point for the economy.



Technical traders also sometimes refer to swing lows as troughs, and swing highs as peaks. Asset prices move up and down, forming peaks and troughs.


   Examples of Troughs in the U.S.  

An economic trough occurred in June 2009. This date marked the official end of the Great Recession, which began following the economic peak reached in Dec. 2007. At the end of 2007, the U.S. GDP reached an all-time high of $14.99 trillion. It then fell steadily for the next year and a half, a period of severe economic contraction. In June 2009, it bottomed out at $14.36 trillion. A period of expansion ensued, with the GDP eventually surpassing its 2007 high, reaching $15.02 trillion by Sept. 2011.







During the U.S. recession of the early 1990s, the trough occurred in March 1991. At that date, the GDP stood at $8.87, down from $8.98 trillion in July 1990, the month the recession began. The recovery to this recession, marked by the ensuing expansionary phase, was robust, with the GDP surpassing $9 trillion for the first time ever before the end of 1991.


   Frequently Asked Questions  
  When do troughs in the business cycle occur?  

A trough in the business cycle occurs when a recession ends and economic recovery or expansion begins. A recession's depth is determined by the magnitude of the peak-to-trough decline in the broad measures of output, employment, income, and sales. Its diffusion is measured by the extent of its spread across economic activities, industries, and geographical regions. Its duration is determined by the time interval between the peak and the trough.


  What are the stages of the economic cycle?  

The economic cycle is another term for the business cycle. The four stages are expansion, peak, contraction, and trough.


  What are the levels of severity of an economic trough?  

A recession is a trough defined as negative GDP growth occurring over two consecutive quarters and lasting for several months or longer. A depression is commonly defined as an extreme recession that lasts three or more years or which leads to a decline in real gross domestic product (GDP) of at least 10%. in a given year. Depressions are relatively less frequent than milder recessions and tend to be accompanied by high unemployment and low inflation.


  What is a peak vs. a trough in economics?  

A peak is the opposite of a trough: a high point at which expansion shifts to contraction.
What Is a Troy Ounce?  

A troy ounce is a unit of measure used for weighing precious metals that dates back to the Middle Ages. Originally used in Troyes, France, one troy ounce is equal to 31.1034768 grams, according to the U.K. Royal Mint.



One standard ounce (also known as an avordupois ounce) is used to weigh other commodities such as sugar and grain. A standard ounce is slightly less than a troy ounce, at 28.35 grams.



The troy ounce is to this day the standard unit of measurement in the precious metals market to ensure purity standards. The troy ounce is often abbreviated to read "t oz" or "oz t." 





Key Takeaways

The troy ounce is a metric used in weighing precious metals.The troy ounce is the equivalent of 31.1034768 grams.A standard ounce is the equivalent of 28.349 grams, or around 10% less.A troy pound (12 troy ounces) is lighter than a standard pound (14.6 troy ounces).The troy ounce is the last remaining metric still used in the troy weighting system.


   Understanding the Troy Ounce  

The troy ounce is the only measure of the troy weighting system that is still used in modern times. It is used in the pricing of metals, such as gold, platinum, and silver. Thus, when prices of precious metals are listed per-ounce, it is often referencing the troy ounce.



It was also used when weighing certain gemstones. The troy weight system, however, has largely been replaced by the carat system in the world of precious gems and stones.


   History of the Troy Ounce  

The troy system for weights and measures is believed to have gotten its name from the French city of Troyes, a business hub in the Middle Ages that attracted merchants from around Europe and Britain. In Troyes, merchants measured 480 grains of barley to equal a troy ounce, and 12 troy ounces equaled one troy pound. 



Some historians, however, believe the troy ounce had its origins in Roman times. Romans standardized their monetary system using bronze bars that could be broken down into 12 pieces called "uncia" or ounce, with each piece weighing around 31.1 grams.



As Europe's economic importance grew from the 10th century onward, merchants came from all over the world to buy and sell goods there. It was, therefore, necessary to develop a new standardized monetary weight system to make doing business much easier. Some believe the merchants of Troyes modeled their new monetary system on the weights developed by their Roman ancestors.



Before the adoption of the metric system across Europe, the French-born King Henry II of England adjusted the British coinage system to better reflect the French troy system. The system was adjusted periodically, but troy weights, as we know them today, were first used in England in the 15th century.



Prior to the adoption of the troy system, the British used an Anglo-Norman French system called the avoirdupois system. The word means "goods of weight" and was used to weigh both precious metals and non-precious metal goods. By 1527, the troy ounce became the official standard measurement for gold and silver in Britain, and the U.S. followed suit in 1828.


   Troy Ounce vs. Ounce  

The avoirdupois ounce, simply referred to as ounce (oz), is the standard used in the US to measure foods and other items, with the exception of precious metals and gems. It is the equivalent of 28.349 grams or 437.5 grains. A troy ounce is a little heavier, with a gram equivalent of 31.1. The difference (2.751) may be minute for a small quantity, but can be substantial for large quantities.



When the price of gold is said to be US $653/ounce, the ounce being referred to is a troy ounce, not a standard ounce. Because a troy ounce is heavier than a standard ounce, there are 14.6 troy ounces—compared to 16 standard ounces—in one pound. This pound is not to be confused with a troy pound, which is lighter and is made up of 12 troy ounces.

   Investing in Precious Metals  

The difference between a troy ounce and an avoirdupois ounce is of concern mostly to investors in precious metals.



Gold has historically been seen as the ultimate safe haven, although its market price is volatile, not least because of its status as an imperishable asset. But the age-old practice of using gold and silver as a store of wealth has been joined in modern times by two more precious metals:



Platinum is a relative newcomer to international precious metals trading, having been "discovered" by Europeans in South America in the first half of the eighteenth century. This silvery-white metal is used in high-end jewelry but its main use is in catalytic converters for vehicles. It also has uses in the chemicals industry.Palladium is rarely found in nature but can be extracted for commercial use from other metals including platinum, copper, and zinc. It has the same industrial uses as platinum and also is used in medical, dental, and electronics equipment.


  Ways to Invest in Precious Metals  

Most modern investors probably don't want to buy precious metals by the troy ounce and stow them in a safe at home. Luckily, there are modern ways to invest in these metals:



Commodity exchange-traded funds (ETFs) or mutual funds are the easy way to get into investing in precious metals. Just as with any fund, you don't take delivery of the metals you own through the fund, but you can buy and sell fund shares all the same.
Common stock shares of companies in the metals and mining sector are a more direct way to gain a stake in precious metals. They're riskier, too. You're putting your money on a single company's luck at locating and extracting the precious stuff.
Futures and options markets exist for precious metals. Internet access has made all things accessible but these markets are dominated by professional traders and institutional investors.
Gold certificates, once a usable form of government-issued currency, can still be purchased from some banks and investment companies. They are basically a portable gold equivalent, but they're no longer backed by the full faith and credit of any government. They're backed by the entity they are purchased from, with the potential risk that implies.




Which Is Heavier: 1 oz. or 1 Troy Ounce?
A troy ounce is approximately 10% heavier than a standard ounce (1.0:1.097).




What Are Troy Ounces Used for Today?
Troy ounces are still used in measurements of precious metals (like gold and silver) and gemstones. Most other goods are weighed using either the metric system or standard ounces.




What Is a Troy Pound?
A troy pound is 12 troy ounces (while a standard pound is 16 standard ounces). 1 troy pound = 0.823 pounds.


   The Bottom Line  

Troy ounces are used to measure weights of gems and precious metals. One troy ounce is equal to 1.097 standard ounces, making it around 10% heavier. The name dates back to the 16th century French town of Troyes, which was an important trade center that standardized the troy ounce as 480 grains of barley.

What Is the True Strength Index (TSI)?  

The true strength index (TSI) is a technical momentum oscillator used to identify trends and reversals. The indicator may be useful for determining overbought and oversold conditions, indicating potential trend direction changes via centerline or signal line crossovers, and warning of trend weakness through divergence.

Key Takeaways

The TSI fluctuates between positive and negative territory. Positive territory means the bulls are more in control of the asset. Negative territory means the bears are more in control.When the indicator divergences with price, the TSI may be signaling the price trend is weakening and may reverse.A signal line can be applied to the TSI indicator. When the TSI crosses above the signal line it can be used as a buy signal, and when it crosses below, a sell signal. Such crossovers occur frequently, so use with caution.Overbought and oversold levels will vary by the asset being traded.


   The True Strength Index (TSI) Formula  

The formula for calculating the TSI involves the following steps.

  How to Calculate the True Strength Index (TSI)  

The main skill required in computing the TSI is the ability to calculate an EMA.



Record price changes and absolute price changes in order to calculate an EMA for both these values.Calculate the price change 25-period EMA and the absolute price change 25-period EMA.Smooth both of these EMAs by applying a 13-period EMA to each of them.Compute the TSI value by plugging the now double-smoothed price change and double-smoothed absolute price change into the TSI formula.


   What Does the True Strength Index (TSI) Tell You?  

The true strength index (TSI) is primarily used to identify overbought and oversold conditions in an asset's price, spot divergence, identify trend direction and changes via the centerline, and highlight short-term price momentum with signal line crossovers.



Since the TSI is based on price movements, oversold and overbought levels will vary by the asset being traded. Some stocks may reach +30 and -30 before tending to see price reversals, while another stock may reverse near +20 and -20.



Mark extreme TSI levels, on the asset being traded, to see where overbought and oversold is. Being oversold doesn't necessarily mean it is time to buy, and when an asset is overbought it doesn't necessarily mean it is time to sell. Traders will typically watch for other signals to trigger a trade decision. For example, they may wait for the price or TSI to start dropping before selling in overbought territory. Alternatively, they may wait for a signal line crossover.


  Signal Line Crossovers  

The TSI has a signal line, which is usually a seven- to 12-period EMA of the TSI line. A signal line crossover occurs when the TSI line crosses the signal line. When the TSI crosses above the signal line from below, that may warrant a long position. When the TSI crosses below the signal line from above, that may warrant selling or short selling.



Signal line crossovers occur frequently, so should be utilized only in conjunction with other signals from the TSI. For example, buy signals may be favored when the TSI is above the centerline (above zero). Or sell signals may be favored when the TSI is in overbought territory.


  Centerline Crossovers  

The centerline crossover is another signal the TSI generates. Price momentum is positive when the indicator is above zero and negative when it is below zero.



Some traders use the centerline for a directional bias. For example, a trader may decide only to enter a long position if the indicator is above its centerline. Conversely, the trader would be bearish and only consider short positions if the indicator's value is below zero.


  Breakouts and Divergence  

Traders can use support and resistance levels created by the TSI to identify breakouts and price momentum shifts. For instance, if the indicator breaks below a trendline, the price may see continued selling.



Divergence is another tool the TSI provides. If the price of an asset is moving higher while the TSI is dropping, that is called bearish divergence and could result in a downside price move. Conversely, if the TSI is rising while the price is falling, that could signal higher prices to come. This is called bullish divergence.



Divergence is a poor timing signal, so it should only be used in conjunction with other signals generated by the TSI or other technical indicators.






The TSI should be used in conjunction with other forms of analysis, such as price action analysis and other technical indicators.


   The True Strength Index (TSI) vs. the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) Indicator  

The TSI is smoothing price changes to create a technical oscillator. The moving average convergence divergence (MACD) indicator is measuring the separation between two moving averages. Both indicators are used in similar ways for trading purposes, yet they are not calculated the same and will provide different signals at different times.


   Limitations of the True Strength Index (TSI)  

Many of the signals provided by the TSI will be false signals. That means the price action will be different than expected following a trade signal. For example, during an uptrend, the TSI may cross below the centerline several times, but then the price proceeds higher even though the TSI indicates momentum has shifted down.



Signal line crossovers also occur so frequently that they may not provide a lot of trading benefit. Such signals need to be heavily filtered based on other elements of the indicator or through other forms of analysis. The TSI will also sometimes change direction without the price changing direction, resulting in trade signals that look good on the TSI but continue to lose money based on price.



Divergence, too, tends to be unreliable on the indicator. Divergence can last so long that it provides little insight into when a reversal will actually occur. Also, divergence isn't always present when price reversals actually do occur.
What Is a Trust?  

A trust is a legal entity with separate and distinct rights, similar to a person or corporation. In a trust, a party known as a trustor gives another party, the trustee, the right to hold title to and manage property or assets for the benefit of a third party, the beneficiary.



Trusts can be established to provide legal protection for the trustor’s assets to ensure they are distributed according to their wishes. Additionally, trusts can save time, reduce paperwork, and sometimes reduce inheritance or estate taxes.



Trusts can also be used as a closed-end fund built as a public limited company. Learn more about trusts and how they are used to protect assets for beneficiaries.





Key Takeaways

A trust is a fiduciary relationship in which a trustor gives another party, known as the trustee, the right to hold title to property or assets for the benefit of a third party.While they are generally associated with the idle rich, trusts are highly versatile instruments that can be used for various purposes to achieve specific goals.Each trust falls into six broad categories—living or testamentary, funded or unfunded, revocable, or irrevocable.

   Understanding Trusts  

Trusts are created by settlors (an individual along with a lawyer) who decide how to transfer parts or all of the individual's assets to trustees. These trustees hold on to the assets for the beneficiaries of the trust.



The rules of a trust depend on the terms on which it was built. In some areas, it is possible for beneficiaries to become trustees. For example, in some jurisdictions, the grantor can be a lifetime beneficiary and a trustee at the same time.



A trust can be used to determine how a person’s money should be managed and distributed while that person is alive or after death. A trust helps an estate avoid taxes and probate. It can protect assets from creditors and dictate the terms of inheritance for beneficiaries.






The disadvantages of trusts are that they require time and money to create, and they cannot be easily revoked.



A trust is one way to provide for an underage beneficiary or someone who cannot manage their finances due to medical or other conditions. Once the beneficiary is deemed capable of managing their assets, they will receive possession of the assets held in trust.


   Categories of Trusts  

Although there are many different types of trusts, each fits into one or more of the following categories:



Living or testamentaryRevocable or irrevocableFunded or unfunded


  Living or Testamentary  

A living trust, also called an inter-vivos trust, is a written document in which an individual's assets are provided as a trust for the individual's use and benefit during their lifetime. A trustee is named when the trust is established; this person is in charge of handling the affairs of the trust and transferring the assets to the beneficiaries at the time of the grantor's death.



A testamentary trust, also called a will trust, specifies how an individual's assets are designated after the grantor's death. 


  Revocable or Irrevocable  

A revocable trust can be changed or terminated by the trustor during that person's lifetime. An irrevocable trust, as the name implies, cannot be changed once it's established.



Living trusts can be revocable or irrevocable. Testamentary trusts are generally irrevocable once established but can be revocable via a will if the grantor is still alive. The fact that it is unalterable, containing assets that have been permanently moved out of the trustor's possession, is what allows estate taxes to be minimized or avoided altogether.

  Funded or Unfunded  

A funded trust has assets put into it by the trustor during their lifetime. An unfunded trust consists only of the trust agreement with no funding. Unfunded trusts can become funded upon the trustor’s death or remain unfunded. Since an unfunded trust exposes assets to many of the perils a trust is designed to avoid, ensuring proper funding is important.


   Common Purposes for Trusts  

The trust fund is an ancient instrument (dating back to feudal times, in fact) that is sometimes greeted with scorn due to its association with the idle rich (as in the pejorative "trust fund baby"). But trusts are highly versatile vehicles that can protect assets and direct them into the right hands long after the original asset owner's death.



A trust is generally employed to hold assets so that they are safe from creditors or others that might have a claim on them after the grantor's death. In addition, trusts are often used to keep assets safe from family members who might otherwise sell or spend them. Assets may be placed in trust for trustworthy family members—even a relative with the best intentions could face a lawsuit, divorce, or other misfortune, putting those assets at risk.



Trusts can also be used to secure assets for specific purposes, such as a beneficiary's education or to help them start a business.


  Beneficiary Care  

Trusts may seem geared primarily toward high-net-worth individuals and families, since they can be expensive to establish and maintain. However, those of more average means may find them useful. For example, trusts can be established to ensure a dependent with a physical disability or mental health condition receives care.






You might also find instances of someone who has created a trust to qualify for Medicaid and still preserve at least a portion of their wealth.


  Privacy  

Some individuals use trusts simply for privacy. The terms of a will may be public in some jurisdictions. A will's conditions can be applied through a trust, so many individuals who don't want their intentions publicly posted choose to use them.


  Estate Planning  

Trusts can also be used for estate planning. Typically, a deceased individual's assets are passed to the spouse and then equally divided among the surviving children. However, children who are under the legal age of 18 need to have trustees. The trustees only have control over the assets until the children reach adulthood.



Trusts can also be used for tax planning. In some cases, the tax consequences of using trusts are lower than other alternatives. Because of this, trusts have become a staple in tax planning for individuals and corporations.


  Tax Saving Basis  

Assets in a revocable trust benefit from a step-up in basis, which can mean substantial tax savings for the heirs who eventually inherit from the trust. However, if the assets are placed in an irrevocable trust, they are subject to carryover basis, or their original cost basis.



Here's how the stepped-up basis calculation works: The original cost of shares was $5,000. The shares were placed into a revocable trust and passed on to a beneficiary. At the time the stocks were passed on, they were worth $10,000, so they have a step-up in basis of $10,000. Had the same beneficiary received them as a gift when the original owner was still alive, their basis would be $5,000. The difference is key when calculating taxes.



So, if the trust beneficiary sold the shares for $12,000, they would owe tax on a $2,000 gain. A beneficiary given the shares, or one who had a carryover basis, would owe taxes on a gain of $7,000 ($5,000 plus $2,000). Note that the step-up basis applies to inherited assets in general, not just those that involve a trust.


   Types of Trust Funds  

Below is a list of some of the more common types of trust funds:



Credit Shelter Trust: Sometimes called a bypass trust or family trust, this trust allows a person to bequeath an amount up to (but not over) the estate-tax exemption. The rest of the estate passes to a spouse tax-free. Funds placed in a credit shelter trust are forever free of estate taxes, even if they grow.
Generation-Skipping Trust: This trust allows a person to transfer assets tax-free to beneficiaries at least two generations their junior, typically their grandchildren.
Qualified Personal Residence Trust: This trust removes a person's home (or vacation home) from their estate. This could be helpful if the properties are likely to appreciate significantly.
Insurance Trust: This irrevocable trust shelters a life insurance policy within a trust, thus removing it from a taxable estate. While a person may no longer borrow against the policy or change beneficiaries, proceeds can be used to pay estate costs after a person dies.
Qualified Terminable Interest Property Trust: This trust allows a person to direct assets to specific beneficiaries (their survivors) at different times. In the typical scenario, a spouse will receive lifelong income from the trust, and children will get what’s left after the spouse dies.
Separate Share Trust: This trust lets a parent establish a trust with different features for each beneficiary (i.e., child).
A Spendthrift Trust: This trust protects the assets a person places in the trust from being claimed by creditors. This trust also allows for the management of the assets by an independent trustee and forbids the beneficiary from selling their interest in the trust.
Charitable Trust: This trust benefits a particular charity or non-profit organization. Normally, a charitable trust is established as part of an estate plan and helps lower or avoid estate and gift taxes. A charitable remainder trust, funded during a person's lifetime, disperses income to the designated beneficiaries (like children or a spouse) for a specified period and then donates the remaining assets to the charity.
Special Needs Trust: This trust is meant for a dependent who receives government benefits, such as Social Security disability benefits. Setting up the trust enables the person with a disability to receive income without affecting or forfeiting the government payments.
Blind Trust: This trust allows the trustees to handle the assets in the trust without the beneficiaries' knowledge. This could be useful if the beneficiary needs to avoid conflicts of interest.
Totten Trust: Also known as a payable-on-death account, this trust is created during the trustor's lifetime, who also acts as the trustee. It's generally used for bank accounts (physical property cannot be put into it). The big advantage is that assets in the trust avoid probate upon the trustor’s death. Often called a “poor man’s trust," this variety does not require a written document and often costs nothing to set up. It can be established simply by having the title on the account include identifying language such as "In Trust For," "Payable on Death To," or "As Trustee For."




What Is the Benefit of an Irrevocable Trust?
By placing assets into an irrevocable trust, you give up their control and ownership. This means they will not be considered part of your estate, which helps to minimize estate tax after you die and avoid the probate process.




How Much Does a Trust Cost to Set Up?
A trust is a complex legal and financial entity that should be established with the help of a qualified attorney. Costs increase depending on the complexity of the trust. The price to establish a revocable trust can range from less than $1,000 to $3,000; irrevocable trusts are more expensive—how much you'll pay depends on how complex it is and how much attorneys charge in your area.




Who Controls a Trust?
The one establishing a trust is called the trustor or grantor. The one who oversees and manages the trust is called the trustee. In a revocable trust, the trustor may control the trust as well, but in an irrevocable trust, the trustee must be somebody else. The trust's beneficiaries are those who benefit from the trust, and the trustee ensures that the beneficiaries are paid.


   The Bottom Line  

Trusts are complex vehicles, except perhaps for the Totten trust. Creating a trust typically requires expert advice from a trust attorney or a trust company, which sets up trust funds as part of a wide range of estate- and asset-management services.

What Is a Trust Company?  

A trust company is a legal entity that acts as a fiduciary, agent, or trustee on behalf of a person or business for the purpose of administration, management, and the eventual transfer of assets to a beneficial party. The trust company acts as a custodian for trusts, estates, custodial arrangements, asset management, stock transfer, beneficial ownership registration, and other related arrangements.





Key Takeaways

A trust company is a legal entity that acts as a fiduciary, agent, or trustee on behalf of a person or business for a trust.A trust company is typically tasked with the administration, management, and the eventual transfer of assets to beneficiaries.A trust company acts as a custodian for trusts, estates, custodial arrangements, asset management, stock transfer, and beneficial ownership registration.Trusts are managed for profit, which it may take out of the assets annually or upon transfer to the beneficial third party.


   How Trust Companies Work  

Although trusts often have an individual assigned as the trustee, a trust company can also act in the same capacity. A trust company does not own the assets its customers assign to its management, but it may assume some legal obligation to take care of assets on behalf of other parties.



A trust company or trust department is usually a division or an associated company of a commercial bank. Trusts and similar arrangements managed for eventual transfer are managed for profit, which it may take out of the assets annually or upon transfer to the beneficial third party.



There are many trust companies to choose from, ranging in size and fees. The larger trust companies provide more products and services but may lack the personal touch of smaller institutions. Some of the larger trust companies are Northern Trust, Bessemer Trust, and U.S. Trust, which is now part of Bank of America Corporation. These trusts generally charge their fees based on a percentage of assets, ranging from 0.25% to 2.0%, depending on the size of the trust.


   What Trust Companies Offer  

Trust companies offer a variety of services, including the daily operational tasks for managing the trust. Also, there are many types of trusts that can use trust companies as a trustee, such as charitable trusts.



Wealth management services are one of the most common uses for a trust company, which includes investment management and wealth preservation so that a client's future generations have the funds when needed.Trust companies offer asset-management services, such as bill pay, check writing, and other features.Trust companies also offer brokerage services with a wide array of investments available to their clients.Some trust companies can build financial plans for their clients for additional fees, depending on the level of service needed.



Trust companies are also used in estate planning matters. A trust company can be left as a successor trustee for a trust when there are no financially responsible family members. Upon the death of the grantor, the trust company will become the new trustee and manage the assets according to the terms of the trust.






Trust companies also offer a variety of estate-oriented services, such as guardianship, estate settlement, and non-financial asset management.


   Benefits of a Trust Company  

A trust company is hired to act as a fiduciary, meaning they act on your behalf and won't take advantage of you. As a result, a trust company can make all of the investment decisions and act in the best interest of its client. The investment management services offered by trust companies can be helpful to those who are not experienced or knowledgeable about the financial markets.



Also, clients who don’t want or care to manage their day-to-day finances can also benefit from using a trust company.



Trust companies are often good alternatives for preventing future family squabbles when dealing with inheritances and estate planning. If dividing up the assets of an estate will cause family turmoil, a trust company can act as a neutral third party.
What Is a Trust Deed?  

A trust deed —also known as a deed of trust—is a document sometimes used in real estate transactions in the U.S. It is a document that comes into play when one party has taken out a loan from another party to purchase a property. The trust deed represents an agreement between the borrower and a lender to have the property held in trust by a neutral and independent third party until the loan is paid off.



Although trust deeds are less common than they once were, some 20 states still mandate the use of one, rather than a mortgage, when financing is involved in the purchase of real estate. Trust deeds are common in Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho, Illinois, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, North Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, and West Virginia.



A few states—such as Kentucky, Maryland, and South Dakota—allow the use of both trust deeds and mortgages.





Key Takeaways

In financed real estate transactions, trust deeds transfer the legal title of a property to a third party—such as a bank, escrow company, or title company—to hold until the borrower repays their debt to the lender.Trust deeds are used in place of mortgages in several states.Investing in trust deeds can provide a high-yielding income stream.

   Understanding Trust Deeds  

A trust deed is a transaction between three parties:



Lenders, officially known as beneficiaries. These are the interests a trust is supposed to protect.
A borrower, otherwise known as a trustor. This is the person who establishes a trust.
A trustee, a third party charged with holding the entrusted property until a loan or debt is paid for in full.



In a real estate transaction—the purchase of a home, say—a lender gives the borrower money in exchange for one or more promissory notes linked to a trust deed. This deed transfers legal title to the real property to an impartial trustee, typically a title company, escrow company, or bank, which holds it as collateral for the promissory notes. The equitable title — the right to obtain full ownership — remains with the borrower, as does full use of and responsibility for the property.



This state of affairs continues throughout the repayment period of the loan. The trustee holds the legal title until the borrower pays the debt in full, at which point the title to the property transfers to the borrower. If the borrower defaults on the loan, the trustee takes full control of the property.


   Trust Deed vs. Mortgage  

Trust deeds and mortgages are both used in bank and private loans for creating liens on real estate, and both are typically recorded as debt in the county where the property is located. However, there are some differences.


  Number of Parties  

A mortgage involves two parties: a borrower (or mortgagor) and a lender (or mortgagee). When a borrower signs a mortgage, they pledge the property as security to the lender to ensure repayment.



In contrast, a trust deed involves three parties: a borrower (or trustor), a lender (or beneficiary), and the trustee. The trustee holds title to the lien for the lender's benefit; if the borrower defaults, the trustee will initiate and complete the foreclosure process at the lender's request.


  Type of Foreclosure  

In the event of default, a deed of trust will result in different foreclosure procedures than a mortgage. A defaulted mortgage will result in a judicial foreclosure, meaning that the lender will have to secure a court order. Trust deeds go through a non-judicial foreclosure, provided that they include a power-of-sale clause.



Judicial foreclosures are more expensive and time-consuming than non-judicial foreclosures. This means that in states that allow them, a deed of trust is preferable to a mortgage from the lender's point of view.






Contrary to popular usage, a mortgage is not technically a loan to buy a property; it's an agreement that pledges the property as collateral for the loan.


   What Is Included in a Trust Deed?  

A deed of trust will include the same type of information stated in a mortgage document, such as:



The identities of the borrower, lender, and trusteeA full description of the property to be placed in trustAny restrictions or requirements on the use of the property while it is in trustThe terms of the loan, including principal, monthly payments, and interest rateThe terms of any late fees and penalties in the event of repayment



In addition, a trust deed will also include a power of sale clause that gives the trustee the right to sell the property if the borrower defaults.


   Foreclosures and Trust Deeds  

Mortgages and trust deeds have different foreclosure processes. A judicial foreclosure is a court-supervised process enforced when the lender files a lawsuit against the borrower for defaulting on a mortgage. The process is time-consuming and expensive.



Also, if the foreclosed-property auction doesn't bring in enough money to pay off the promissory note, the lender may file a deficiency judgment against the borrower, suing for the balance. However, even after the property is sold, the borrower has the right of redemption: they may repay the lender within a set amount of time and acquire the property title.



In contrast, a trust deed lets the lender commence a faster and less-expensive non-judicial foreclosure, bypassing the court system and adhering to the procedures outlined in the trust deed and state law. If the borrower does not make the loan current, the property is put up for auction through a trustee's sale.



The title transfers from the trustee to the new owner through the trustee's deed after the sale. When there are no bidders at the trustee sale, the property reverts to the lender through a trustee's deed. Once the property is sold, the borrower has no right of redemption.



Furthermore, a trustee has the responsibility of paying the proceeds from the sale to the borrower and lender after the sale is finalized. The trustee will pay the lender the amount left over on the debt and pay the borrower anything that surpasses that amount, thereby allowing the lender to purchase the property.


   Pros and Cons of Investing in Trust Deeds  

Investors who are searching for juicy yields sometimes turn to the real estate sector—in particular, trust deeds.



In trust deed investing, the investor lends money to a developer working on a real estate project. The investor's name goes on the deed of trust as the lender. The investor collects interest on his loan; when the project is finished his principal is returned to him in full. A trust deed broker usually facilitates the deal.





Pros

High-yielding income stream
Portfolio diversification



Cons

Illiquidity
No capital appreciation






What sort of developer enters this arrangement? Banks are often reluctant to lend to certain types of developments, such as mid-size commercial projects—too small for the big lenders, too big for the small ones—or developers with poor track records or too many loans. Cautious lenders may also move too slowly for developers up against a tight deadline for commencing or completing a project.



Developers like these are often in a bit of a crunch. For these reasons, trust deed investors may often expect high-interest rates on their money. They can reap the benefits of diversifying into a different asset class, without having to be experts in real-estate construction or management. This is a form of passive investment.



Trust deed investing has certain risks and disadvantages. Unlike stocks, real estate investments are not liquid, meaning investors cannot retrieve their money on demand. Also, investors can expect only the interest the loan generates; any additional capital appreciation is unlikely.



Invested parties may exploit any legal discrepancies in the trust deed, causing costly legal entanglements that may endanger the investment. The typical investor with little experience may have difficulty, as it takes specific expertise to find credible and trustworthy developers, projects, and brokers.


   Real-World Example of a Trust Deed  

A short form deed of trust document used in Austin County, Texas, covers the requirements for most lenders. The form begins with a definition of terms and spaces for the borrower, lender, and trustee to fill in their names. The amount being borrowed and the address of the property are also required.



After this section, the document goes on to specify the transfer of rights in the property and uniform covenants including:



Details about payment of principal and interestEscrow fundsLiensProperty insurance and structure maintenanceStructure occupancy—stipulating the borrower must take up residency within 60 days



The form also includes nonuniform covenants, which specify default or breach of any of the agreement terms. And it specifies that the loan the document deals with is not a home equity loan—that is, something the borrower will receive cash from—but one for purchasing the property.



The deed of trust ends with a space for the borrower's signature, which must be done in the presence of a notary and two witnesses, who also sign.




What Is Assignment in a Deed of Trust?
In real estate law, "assignment" is simply the transfer of a deed of trust from one party to another. This usually happens when the beneficiary of a trust deed sells their loan to another lender.




What Is Reconveyance in a Deed of Trust?
In real estate law, reconveyance means the transfer of a property from a lender or trustee to a borrower. This usually happens at the end of a mortgage or other loan, when the borrower has satisfied the terms of their debt.




Who Can Be a Trustee in a Deed of Trust?
Some states have laws limiting who can act as a trustee in a deed of trust. In these states, the trustee must be a bank, credit union, thrift, title insurance company, attorney, or other company specifically authorized to hold a trust. In other states, anyone can act as a trustee.


   The Bottom Line  

Trust deeds are an alternative to mortgages in certain states. Instead of an agreement directly between a lender and a borrower, a trust deed places the title of a property in the hands of a third party, or trustee. Only after the borrower has satisfied the terms of their debt to the lender will the property be fully transferred to the borrower.
What Is a Trust Fund?  

A trust fund is an estate planning tool that is a legal entity that holds property or assets for a person or organization. Trust funds can hold a variety of assets, such as money, real property, stocks, bonds, a business, or a combination of many different types of properties or assets.



Three parties are required in order to establish a trust fund: the grantor, the beneficiary, and the trustee. Trust funds are managed by the trustee who must act for the benefit of the grantor and beneficiary.



Trust funds can take many forms and can be established under different stipulations. They offer certain tax benefits as well as financial protections and support for those involved.





Key Takeaways

A trust fund is designed to hold and manage assets on someone else's behalf, with the help of a neutral third party.Trust funds include a grantor, beneficiary, and trustee.The grantor of a trust fund can set terms for the way assets are to be held, gathered, or distributed.The trustee manages the fund's assets and executes its directives, while the beneficiary receives the assets or other benefits from the fund.Trust funds can be revocable and irrevocable, and there are several variations that exist for specific purposes.

   How Trust Funds Work  

Estate planning is a process that involves determining how an individual's assets and other financial affairs will be managed and how any property they have is distributed after they die. This includes any bank accounts, investments, personal property, real estate, life insurance, artwork, and debt. While wills are the most common estate planning tools, trust funds are also popular legal entities.



The following three parties are involved in establishing a trust fund:



The grantor, who sets it up and populates it with their assets
The beneficiary(s) or the person (people) for whom the assets are managed
The trustee, who is a neutral third party (an individual, a trust bank, or another professional fiduciary) charged with managing the assets involved



The grantor generally creates an arrangement that, for a variety of reasons, is carried out after they are no longer mentally competent or alive. As the appointed fiduciary, the trustee is responsible for carrying out the interests of the grantor. This usually includes allocating living expenses or even educational expenses, such as private school or college expenses, while they are alive. Or they can pay out a lump sum directly to the beneficiary.



Trust funds provide certain benefits and protections for those who create them and to their beneficiaries. For instance:



Some types can keep assets held away from any creditors in the event they decide to pursue the grantor for unpaid debts.
They avoid the need to go through probate, which is the process of analyzing and distributing assets after someone dies without leaving any instructions behind.
Some trust funds can reduce the amount of estate and inheritance taxes owed after the grantor dies after which the assets are distributed to the beneficiary(s).






An estate tax is levied on the value of an estate after the grantor dies while inheritance taxes are applied to the total amount a beneficiary inherits from an estate.


   Special Considerations  

Wealth and family arrangements can grow quite complicated when millions (or even billions) of dollars are at stake for multiple generations of a family or other entity. As such, a trust fund can contain a surprisingly complex array of options and specifications to suit the needs of a grantor. 



But contrary to what most people believe, trust funds aren't just for the ultra-rich. In fact, they can be useful for just about anyone regardless of their financial situation. Discuss your needs with a financial professional to find out what kind of fund is well-suited for you and your personal needs.


   Revocable Trust Funds vs. Irrevocable Trust Funds  

Trust funds fall into two different categories: Revocable and irrevocable trust funds. The following are brief descriptions of the two.


  Revocable Trust Fund  

A revocable trust fund gives a grantor better control over assets during the grantor’s lifetime. Once assets are placed into it, they can be transferred to any number of designated beneficiaries after the grantor's death. Also called a living trust fund, it can be used to transfer assets to children or grandchildren.



The primary benefit is that the assets avoid probate, which leads to the quick distribution of assets to the listed beneficiaries. Living trust funds are not made public, meaning an estate is distributed with a high level of privacy. 



Changes can be made while the grantor is alive and it can also be entirely revoked prior to the grantor's death.


  Irrevocable Trust Fund  

An irrevocable trust fund is very difficult to change or revoke. Because of this arrangement, there can be considerable tax benefits for the grantor to effectively give away control of the assets to the trust fund. Irrevocable trust funds most often avoid probate.


   Types of Trust Funds  

Revocable and irrevocable trust arrangements can be further classified into several types of trust funds. These types often have different rules and stipulations depending on the assets involved and, more importantly, the beneficiary. A tax or a trust attorney may be your best resource for understanding the intricacies of each of these vehicles. Keep in mind that this isn't an exhaustive list.



Asset Protection: This fund protects a person's assets from their creditors' future claims.
Blind: This fund tries to remove any hint of conflict of interest. As such, the trust fund's grantor and beneficiary have no knowledge of the holdings or how they are managed. It does, however, give control to the trustee.
Charitable: A charitable trust fund benefits a particular charity or the general public. This includes a Charitable Remainder Annuity Trust (CRAT) that pays a fixed amount each year. A Charitable Remainder Unitrust passes assets to a specified charity once the fund expires, and gives the donor a charitable deduction as well as a fixed percentage of income to the beneficiary during the life of the trust fund.
Generation-Skipping:  This one contains tax benefits when the beneficiary is one of the grantor’s grandchildren, or anyone at least 37½ years younger than the grantor.
Grantor Retained Annuity: Establishing this type of fund allows the grantor to transfer any appreciation of assets to any beneficiaries to minimize estate taxes.
Individual Retirement Account: Trustees control IRA distributions rather than the beneficiaries.
Land: This allows for the management of property, such as land, a home, or another type of real estate.
Marital This is funded at one spouse's death and is eligible for the unlimited marital deduction.
Medicaid: Designed to allow individuals to set aside assets as gifts to their beneficiaries, this allows the grantor to qualify for long-term care under Medicaid.
Qualified Personal Residence: An individual can move their personal residence from their estate to this type of fund in order to reduce the amount of gift tax incurred.
Qualified Terminable Interest Property: This one benefits a surviving spouse but allows the grantor to make decisions after the surviving spouse’s passing. 
Special Needs: People who receive government benefits are the beneficiaries so as not to disqualify the beneficiary from such government benefits.
Spendthrift: Beneficiaries don't have direct access to the named assets, which means they can't sell, spend, or give away the assets without specific stipulations.
Testamentary: This fund leaves assets to a beneficiary with specific instructions following the grantor’s passing. 




What Is a Trust Fund Baby?
A trust fund baby is someone whose parents set up a trust fund in their name. The term is a popular cultural reference that is often used negatively. When people use the expression, there's an implication that beneficiaries are born with silver spoons in their mouths, are overly privileged, and don't have to work to live.It's true that trust funds can provide beneficiaries with security. But in reality, many so-called trust fund babies don't live luxuriously or in high society.




How Do Trust Funds Work?
Trust funds are legal entities that provide financial, tax, and legal protections for individuals. They require a grantor, who sets it up, one or more beneficiaries, who receive the assets when the grantor dies, and the trustee, who manages it and distributes the assets at a later date.Trust funds are designed to carry out the wishes of the grantor. This means that the trustee is in charge of managing the assets while they are still alive. After their passing, the trustee can pass on the assets to the beneficiary(s) as per the grantor's instructions, whether that's through a regular income stream or a lump sum payment.




How Do I Start a Trust Fund?
In order to set up a trust fund, you'll need to figure out which one is best suited for you, so make sure you figure out the exact purpose of the fund. Then, decide how you'll fund it.

What Is a Trust Indenture?  

A trust indenture is an agreement in a bond contract made between a bond issuer and a trustee that represents the bondholder's interests by highlighting the rules and responsibilities that each party must adhere to. It may also indicate where the income stream for the bond is derived from.





key takeaways

A trust indenture is legal and binding bond contract made between a bond issuer and a trustee to protect the bondholder's interests.A trust indenture describes the bond's characteristics and the terms of its callability. It also delineates the amount of additional debt the issuer can assume, and the circumstances and procedures in case of issuer default.Most corporate bond issues over $5 million are required to include a trust indenture, and to file a copy of it with the SEC.


   How a Trust Indenture Works  

Bonds are issued to lenders or investors to raise money for a corporation or governmental body. To issue a bond, the issuer hires a third-party trustee, usually a bank or trust company, to represent investors who buy the bond. The agreement entered into by the issuer, and the trustee is referred to as the trust indenture.



A trust indenture is a legal and binding contract that is created to protect the interests of bondholders. The trustee’s name and contact information is included in the document, which highlights the terms and conditions that the issuer, lender, and trustee must adhere to during the life of the bond. The section on the trustee's role is important, as it gives a clear indication of how unforeseen incidents will be dealt with. For example, if a conflict of interest comes up involving the trustee's role as a fiduciary, in certain trust indentures, the issue must be resolved within 90 days. Otherwise, a new trustee will be hired.



A trust indenture also includes the characteristics of the bond, such as maturity date, face value, coupon rate, payment schedule, and purpose of the bond issue. One section of the trust indenture dictates the circumstances and processes surrounding a default. The indenture establishes a collective action mechanism under which creditors or bondholders can collect in a fair, orderly manner if default by the issuer takes place. A bondholder should be aware of and understand the proper sequence of events, allowing them to take the proper course of action should such a situation occur.


   Special Provisions of a Trust Indenture  

Protective or restrictive covenants are highlighted in a trust indenture. For example, a trust indenture may indicate whether an issued bond is callable. If the issuer can “call” the bond, the indenture will include call protection for the bondholder, which is the period during which the issuer cannot repurchase the bonds from the market. After the call protection period, the indenture may list the first call dates and any subsequent call dates that the issuer may exercise its right to call. The call premium, that is, the price that will be paid if the issuer repurchases the bond is also indicated on the trust indenture.



Almost all indentures include subordination clauses that limit the amount of additional debt that the issuer can incur, and that dictate that all subsequent debts are subordinated to prior debts. Without such restrictions, an issuer would theroretically be allowed to issue an unlimited amount of debt, increasing bondholders' exposure to default risk.


   Which Bonds Have Trust Indentures?  

Trust indentures may not be included in every bond contract, given thatsome government bonds disclose similar information (the duties andrights of the issuer and bondholders) in a document called the bond resolution.






Many of the current rules regarding trust indentures were established by the Trust Indenture Act (TIA), a piece of legislation passed in 1939 to protect bondholders and investors.



However, most corporate offerings must include a trust indenture. A copy of it must be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for corporate bonds with aggregate principal issues of at least $5 million. Corporate issues for less than $5 million, municipal bonds, and bonds issued by the government are not required to file trust indentures with the SEC. Of course, these exempted entities may choose to create a trust indenture to reassure prospective bond buyers, if not to adhere to any federal law.
What Were Trust Preferred Securities (TruPS)?  

Trust preferred securities (TruPS) were hybrid securities issued by large banks and bank holding companies (BHCs) included in regulatory tier 1 capital and whose dividend payments were tax deductible for the issuer.



The bank would open a trust funded with debt; then, the bank would carve up shares of the trust and sold them to investors in the form of preferred stock. The resulting stock was called a trust preferred security or TruPS.



First issued in 1996, TruPS became the subject of increased regulatory scrutiny following the 2008-09 financial crisis. As a result of the Dodd-Frank reforms and the Volcker Rule, most of these were phased out at year-end 2015. 





Key Takeaways

Trust preferred securities were a type of bank-issued security with characteristics of both debt and stock.They have largely been phased out by legal and regulatory action following the 2008-09 financial crisis.Issued by banks or bank holding companies by issuing debt, TruPS are shares of preferred stock of a trust.The trust preferred security usually offers a higher periodic payment than preferred stock and can have a maturity of up to 30 years.A disadvantage of TruPS for the issuer is the cost, as investors demand higher returns for investments with provisions like deferral of interest payments or early redemption.


   Understanding Trust Preferred Securities (TruPS)  

The trust preferred security has characteristics of both stock and debt. While the trust is funded with debt, the shares issued are considered to be preferred stock and even pay dividends like preferred stock. However, since the trust holds the bank's debt as the funding vehicle, the payments the investors receive are actually interest payments and are taxed as such by the IRS.



The trust preferred security usually offers a higher periodic payment than a share of preferred stock and can have a maturity of up to 30 years due to the long maturity timeline of the debt used to fund the trust. The payments to stockholders can be on a fixed schedule or variable. In addition, some of the provisions in trust preferred securities can allow for the deferral of interest payments for up to five years. The TruPS matures at face value at the end of the term, but there is the potential for early redemption if the issuer so chooses.



Trust preferred securities have been created by companies for their favorable accounting treatments and flexibility. Specifically, these securities are taxed like debt obligations by the Internal Revenue Service while maintaining the appearance of equities in a company's accounting statements, according to GAAP procedures. The issuing bank pays tax-deductible interest payments into the trust, which is then distributed to the trust's shareholders.






It is an important distinction that, when buying a trust preferred security, the investor is buying a portion of the trust and its underlying holdings, not a piece of ownership in the bank itself.


   Special Considerations  

The Dodd-Frank financial reform act, passed in 2010, included a section that called for the phase-out of Tier 1 capital treatment of trust preferred securities issued by institutions with over $15 billion in assets by 2013. Tier 1 capital treatment means that banks can use the money invested in their trust preferred securities to count towards their Tier 1 capital ratio, which is the money banks keep on hand to cover losses sustained due to bad debt.



Phasing out or excluding trust preferred securities in the Tier 1 capital ratio increases funding requirements for banks and, in some cases, reducing the number of incentives for banks to issue trust preferred securities. The so-called “Collins Amendment” was proposed in the U.S. Senate to eliminate trust preferred securities as Tier 1 regulatory capital altogether.  



Finally, the costs are among the disadvantages for companies issuing trust preferred securities because the trusts sometimes have features like deferral of interest payments and early redemption of shares. These nuances make them less attractive to investors and, therefore, the rates on trust preferred securities are typically higher than those offered on other types of debt, simply investors demand a greater rate of return. The costs of investment banking fees for underwriting the securities can be hefty as well.
What Is Trust Property?  

Trust property refers to assets that have been placed into a fiduciary relationship between a trustor and trustee for a designated beneficiary. Trust property may include any type of asset, including cash, securities, real estate, or life insurance policies. Trust property is also referred to as "trust assets" or "trust corpus."





Key Takeaways

Trust property refers to the assets placed into a trust, which are controlled by the trustee on behalf of the trustor's beneficiaries.Trust property removes tax liability on the assets from the trustor to the trust itself, in some cases.Estate planning allows for trust property to pass directly to the designated beneficiaries upon the trustor's death without probate.


   Understanding Trust Property  

Trust property is typically tied into an estate planning strategy used to facilitate the transfer of assets upon death and to reduce tax liability. Some trusts can also protect assets in the event of a bankruptcy or lawsuit. 



The trustee is required to manage the trust property in accordance with the trustor's wishes and in the beneficiary's best interests. A trustee can be an individual or a financial institution such as a bank. A trustor sometimes called a "settlor" or "grantor" can also serve as a trustee managing assets for the benefit of another individual such as a son or daughter. 



Regardless of the role a trustee plays, the individual or organization must abide by specific rules and laws that govern the functioning of whichever type of trust is established. Once property has been transferred to a trust, the trust itself becomes the rightful owner of the assets. In an irrevocable trust, the assets can no longer be controlled or claimed by the previous owner.


   Types of Trusts   

There are several different types of trusts individuals can establish. But they typically fall under two categories, which are revocable trusts and irrevocable trusts.


  Revocable Trust  

In a revocable arrangement, the trustor maintains legal ownership and control of trust assets. For this reason, the trustor would be responsible for paying taxes on the income those assets generate and the trust may also be subject to estate taxes should its value breach the tax-exempt threshold at the time of the grantor's death. 


  Irrevocable Trust  

With an irrevocable trust, the trustor passes legal ownership of the trust assets to a trustee. However, this means those assets leave a person's property effectively lowering the taxable portion of an individual's estate. The trustor also relinquishes certain rights to mend the trust agreement. For example, a trustor usually can't change beneficiaries of an irrevocable trust after they have been established. This is not the case with a revocable trust. 






A trustor may be referred to as grantor or donor in certain situations.


  Payable on Death (POD) Trust  

Trusts can be created during an individual's lifetime, or they can be established following the grantor's death. This situation applies to Payable on Death (POD) trusts, which transfer assets to a beneficiary following the death of the trustor. Generally speaking, this type of trust and similar ones are called testamentary trusts because property is actually transferred following the trustor's death. Assets in these trusts flow directly to the intended beneficiaries following the trustor's death, which means they avoid the often long and expensive process of probate. Probate is the legal process of validating and distributing assets outlined in a will. These trusts can also be outlined in a person's will. 


  Living Trust  

Assets within living trusts can be transferred during the trustor's lifetime. For example, several individuals open accounts in trust with banks for the benefit of their children or to help fund their college expenses. A trustee carefully manages the assets held in the account to achieve this goal, but the children don't have complete access to the funds or the freedom to spend income from the fund as they please. An example of this type of arrangement is a unified gift to minors act (UGMA) account. In some cases, beneficiaries such as children would have access to the trust's assets and the income they generate only after reaching a certain age.
What Is a Trust Receipt?  

A trust receipt is a notice of the release of merchandise to a buyer from a bank, with the bank retaining the ownership title of the released assets. In an arrangement involving a trust receipt, the bank remains the owner of the merchandise, but the buyer is allowed to hold the merchandise in trust for the bank, for manufacturing or sales purposes.





Key Takeaways

A trust receipt is a notice of the release of merchandise to a buyer from a bank, but the bank retains title to these goods.Typically companies involved in these arrangements are equipment dealers, automotive dealers, or companies involved in expensive durable goods.The bank remains the owner of the merchandise, but the buyer is allowed to hold the merchandise in trust for the bank, for manufacturing or sales purposes.This arrangement often falls under a letter of credit financing. The trust receipt serves as a promissory note to the bank that the loan amount will be repaid upon sale of the goods.


   How Trust Receipts Work  

A trust receipt is a financial document attended to by a bank and a business that has received delivery of goods but cannot pay for the purchase until after the inventory is sold. In most cases, the company's cash flow and working capital may be tied up in other projects and business operations.



In the normal course of running a trade business, companies purchase goods for their inventories from vendors or wholesalers to resell to consumers or to manufacture goods. These goods may either be purchased locally or imported from other companies. When these companies receive the merchandise, they are also billed by the seller or exporter for the goods purchased. In the event that the firm does not have the required cash on hand to settle the bill, it may obtain financing from a bank via a trust receipt.



The trust receipt serves as a promissory note to the bank that the loan amount will be repaid upon sale of the goods. The bank pays the exporter on its end or issues the seller (or seller’s bank) a letter of credit guaranteeing payment for the merchandise. The lender, however, retains the title to the merchandise as security. The customer or borrower is required to keep the goods separate from its other inventory and, in effect, holds and sells the goods as a trustee for the bank.



Although the bank has a security interest in the goods under the standard terms of a trust receipt, the customer takes possession of the goods and may do what they want with them as long as they do not violate the terms of their contract with the bank. If the customer decides to terminate the bank’s security interest and tie it to the inventory, they may tender the amount advanced on the goods, gaining total ownership of the goods.


   Example of a Trust Receipt  

Under a typical trust receipt transaction, the business has little to none of its own assets invested in the particular goods financed. The bank bears the majority of the credit risk prevalent in the transaction. The business keeps any profits made from the resale of the goods but also bears the business risk.



If the goods get damaged, lost, or deteriorate in quality or value, the loss is solely the burden of the business and it remains liable for repaying the full loan amount to the bank. In addition, any business expense (such as manufacturing costs, freight, custom dues, storage, etc.) is the responsibility of the business, not the lending institution.


   Special Considerations  

Extending short-term financing through a trust receipt requires the customer or borrower to be in good standing with the bank. The bank and the customer also have to agree to the terms of the trust receipt, including such conditions as the maturity date, interest charge, and financing amount.



Maturity dates under trust receipts are short-term and range from 30 to 180 days. At the time of maturity, the customer must repay the loan to the lender with interest stipulated under the terms of the trust receipt. The bank must be repaid at the time of maturity or after the sale of the goods, whichever comes earlier. If after the maturity date, no payment has been received by the bank or the business defaults in paying its advances, the bank could repossess and dispose of the merchandise.




What Is a Trust Receipt Transaction?
When a company does not have sufficient capital to purchase merchandise, a bank may lend the company the resources to the company, but retain ownership rights, through a trust receipt transaction. Under the terms of a trust receipt agreement, the company agrees to repay the bank once the merchandise has been sold.




What Is the Difference Between a Letter of Credit and a Trust Receipt?
Commonly used in the trade industry, a letter of credit is issued from a bank to that guarantees the payment will be fulfilled and paid to the seller by the buyer. By contrast, a trust receipt is when the bank lends merchandise or goods to a business, but retains ownership of the goods. When the goods have been sold, and payment is made to the bank, the business then becomes owner of the goods.




What Happens If a Trust Receipt Is Violated?
A trust receipt becomes violated when the borrower fails to return the goods that were lent to them, or if they fail to return the sale of proceeds for the goods as stipulated under the terms of the agreement.
What Is a Trustee?  

A trustee is a person or firm that holds and administers property or assets for the benefit of a third party. A trustee may be appointed for various purposes, such as in the case of bankruptcy, certain types of retirement plans or pensions, or to manage assets for someone.



Trustees are required to make decisions in the beneficiary's best interests and have a fiduciary responsibility to them, meaning they act in the best interests of the beneficiaries to manage their assets.





Key Takeaways

A trustee is a person or firm that holds and administers property or assets for the benefit of a third party.A trustee may be appointed for various purposes, such as in the case of bankruptcy, for a charity, or for a trust fund.A trustee's has a fiduciary responsibility to the trust beneficiaries and must make decisions in their best interests.


   How a Trustee Works  

A trustee is any person or organization that holds the legal title of an asset or group of assets for another person, called the grantor. A trustee is granted this legal title through a trust in which the they hold title to the assets held in trust for the benefit of others. The people or entities who benefit from the trust are called beneficiaries.



A trust is a legal entity in which a person or party who owns assets (also called a trustor) gives another party (the trustee) title to those assets or property for the benefit of a third party. For example, a trust might be created to provide legal protection for the trustor's assets and ensure they are appropriately distributed. The trustee is charged with ensuring that the trustor's wishes are fulfilled.



A trustee is thus responsible for properly managing all property and other assets placed in the trust for the beneficiaries. A trustee's specific duties are unique to the trust agreement and are dictated by the type of assets held in the trust. For instance, if a trust holds various rental properties intended to be used for income, it will be the trustee's duty to ensure those those properties are managed, maintained, occupied, and generating income.



Trustees are also required to financially manage and oversee accounts within a trust when it is made up of other investments, such as equities in a brokerage account.






Trustees have a fiduciary duty to the trust's beneficiaries, which means they are required to put aside personal interests, beliefs, and biases to do what's best for the trust.


   Responsibilities of a Trustee  

All trustees have general guidelines and responsibilities, regardless of the specifics in the trust agreement. Trustees generally assume the following duties:



Act as a fiduciary: The role of the trustee is to ensure the trust is administered in accordance with the grantor's wishes.
Ensure the safety of the assets: Accounting for the funds and assets within the trust and understanding who the beneficiaries are and what their rights are. Trustees also ensure trust assets are kept separate from other assets.
Administer the trust: Keeping records of all transactions and distributing assets as required
File reports: Reporting to state and federal regulators as required and keeping the beneficiaries updated
Make decisions: A trustee will be required to make decisions about the assets from time to time as circumstances change. The decisions must align with the grantor's wishes.
Invest: Any investable assets must be invested, allocated, or adjusted as needed in accordance with the wishes of the grantor.
Communicate with beneficiaries: Trustees should initiate communication with the beneficiaries, not wait for contact. Emails, phone calls, or other methods can be used to check in. Beneficiaries should clearly understand the grantor's wishes for the trust, and the trustee should be prepared to answer questions.


   Types of Trustees  

A trustee can be someone you know, but it might be best to find someone with experience. They should understand the trust being set up and know what their responsibilities are. For example, if the trust includes growing assets for your family's future generations, you'd want to appoint someone who understands how to grow wealth.



There are generally three types of trustees:



Individual: These trustees are friends or family members the grantor trusts to administer the funds assets.Independent: These are businesses not part of a financial institution specializing in trust fund management. You'll find investment advisors, accountants, and administrators at these private businesses. Many have names like XYZ Trust Company or ABC Wealth and Trust.Institutional: Many large financial institutions have trust fund professionals that administer, invest, and manage trusts for their clients.


   Trustee vs. Executor  

A trustee administers and manages a trust fund. An executor manages and administers the estate of someone who has died and left assets to heirs through a will. An individual can name one person for each role or could appoint one to perform both roles.



Like a trustee, an executor can be a trust company, a bank, or a trusted friend or family member. The executor must distribute assets in accordance with the will left by the deceased.






Trustees and executors must both follow the laws in their state when performing their duties.


   Who to Choose As a Trustee  

Choosing a trustee might be one of the most challenging tasks when creating a trust. It's tough to know which person or entity you can trust to administer your assets the way you want them to. Here are some considerations for choosing a trustee:



Wealth Management/Trust Company: A wealth management and trust company has finance professionals, attorneys, and accountants and will administer a trust to the letter. Your trust can be set up to pay any fees they may charge, but you'll be able to rest knowing your assets are in the hands of someone who will act in the trust's best interests.Friends or family: You can choose a trusted friend or family member, but you'll need to ensure they are up to the task of administering your trust. Additionally, they'll need an iron will to withstand the drama and resentment that can arise when a family member is in charge of large sums of money and won't give any out on demand. This person must also be willing and able to continue the task as long as the trust exists. Lastly, you'll need to consider and appoint an alternate in case something happens to the primary trustee. This ensures your trust is administered by someone you choose rather than having the courts choose for you.Trust Attorney/Lawyer: A trust attorney can also be an excellent choice. They'll be very familiar with trust laws in your state and be a reliable trustee. However, if one of your intentions as the grantor is to grow wealth within the trust, a lawyer may not be an investment professional or understand how to manage wealth.




What Is the Role of a Trustee?
A trustee administers a trust based on the instructions left by the grantor. This can include communicating with beneficiaries, allocating funds to investments, distributing payments according to instructions, and much more.




What Does It Mean If Someone Is a Trustee?
A trustee has been given the responsibility of ensuring a grantor's assets are used the way they intended them to be.




What Are the 3 Duties of a Trustee?
A trustee must administer the trust per the grantor's instructions, be loyal to the beneficiaries, and deal with beneficiaries impartially.


   The Bottom Line  

A trustee is someone who has been granted a fiduciary responsibility to care for the assets placed in a trust. There are many reasons for placing assets into a trust, from ensuring you have income in your later years to growing wealth for your family and having it distributed as income after you pass.



All states have laws governing trusts and how they must be administered, so when choosing a trustee, it's essential for the person you choose to understand trusts and be up to the task. If you don't know someone capable of being a trustee, you can find wealth management companies, banks, trust companies, and attorneys specializing in administering trusts.
What Is the Truth in Lending Act (TILA)?  

The Truth in Lending Act (TILA) is a federal law enacted in 1968 to help protect consumers in their dealings with lenders and creditors. The TILA has been implemented by the Federal Reserve Board through a series of regulations.



Some of the most important aspects of the TILA concern the information that must be disclosed to a borrower before extending credit, such as the annual percentage rate (APR), the term of the loan, and the total costs to the borrower. This information must be conspicuous on documents presented to the borrower before signing and in some cases on the borrower’s periodic billing statements.





Key Takeaways


The Truth in Lending Act (TILA) protects consumers in their dealings with lenders and creditors.
The regulations found in the TILA apply to most kinds of consumer credit, from mortgages to credit cards.
Lenders are required to clearly disclose information and certain details about their financial products and services to consumers by law.
Regulation Z prohibits creditors from compensating loan originators for anything other than the credit extended and for steering clients to unfavorable options for the sake of higher compensation.
Consumers are able to make better-informed decisions and, within limits, terminate unfavorable agreements, as a result of TILA regulations.



   How the Truth in Lending Act (TILA) Works  

As its name clearly states, the TILA is all about "truth in lending". It was implemented by the Federal Reserve Board’s Regulation Z (12 CFR Part 226) and has been amended and expanded many times in the decades since. The provisions of the act apply to most types of consumer credit, including closed-end credit, such as car loans and home mortgages, and open-end credit, such as a credit card or home equity line of credit.



The rules are designed to make it easier for consumers to comparison shop when they want to borrow money or take out a credit card and safeguard them from misleading or unfair practices on the part of lenders. Some states have their own variations of a TILA, but the chief feature remains the proper disclosure of key information to protect the consumer, as well as the lender, in credit transactions.






The Truth in Lending Act (TILA) gives borrowers the right to back out of certain kinds of loans within a three-day window.


   Examples of the TILA’s Provisions  

The TILA mandates the kind of information lenders must disclose regarding their loans or other services. For example, when would-be borrowers request an application for an adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM), they must be provided with information on how their loan payments could rise in the future under different interest-rate scenarios.



The act also outlaws numerous practices. For example, loan officers and mortgage brokers are prohibited from steering consumers into a loan that will mean more compensation for them, unless the loan is actually in the consumer’s best interests. Credit card issuers are prohibited from charging unreasonable penalty fees when consumers are late with their payments.



Additionally, the TILA provides borrowers with a right of rescission for certain types of loans. That gives them a three-day cooling-off period during which they can reconsider their decision and call off the loan without losing money. The right of rescission protects not just borrowers who may simply have changed their minds but also those who were subjected to high-pressure sales tactics by the lender.



In most instances the TILA does not govern the interest rates a lender may charge, nor does it tell lenders to whom they can or can’t extend credit, as long as they are not violating the laws against discrimination. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 transferred the rule-making authority under the TILA from the Federal Reserve Board to the newly created Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), as of July 2011.






For civil TILA violations, the statute of limitations is one year, whereas for criminal violations is three years.


   Regulation Z and Mortgages  

For closed-end consumer loans, Regulation Z prohibits creditors from issuing compensation to loan originators or mortgagees when such compensation is based on any term other than the credit amount. Therefore, creditors cannot base compensation on whether a term or a condition is present, increased, decreased, or eliminated.



Regulation Z also prohibits loan originators and mortgagees from steering a customer to a certain loan when that loan offers greater compensation to the originator or mortgagee but offers no additional benefit to the customer. For example, if a mortgage broker suggests that a customer choose an inferior loan because it offers better compensation, it is considered steering and is prohibited.



In instances when the consumer compensates the loan originator directly, no other party who knows or should know about that compensation may compensate the loan originator for the same transaction. The regulation also requires creditors who compensate loan originators to keep records for at least two years.



Regulation Z provides a safe harbor when the loan originator, acting in good faith, provides loan options for each type of loan the consumer is interested in. The options, however, must satisfy certain criteria. The options presented must include a loan with the lowest interest rate, a loan with the lowest origination fees, and a loan with the lowest rate for loans with certain provisions, such as loans with no negative amortization or prepayment penalties. In addition, the loan originator must procure offers from lenders with whom they regularly work.


   Benefits of the Truth in Lending Act  

The Truth in Lending Act (TILA) helps consumers shop for and make educated decisions about credit, such as auto loans, mortgages, and credit cards. TILA requires that issuers of credit provide the costs of borrowing in a clear and obvious manner. Without this requirement, some lenders may hide or not disclose terms and rates, or they may present them in a way that is difficult to understand.



Before TILA, some lenders would engage in deceitful and predatory tactics to lure customers into one-sided agreements. After the Truth in Lending Act was established, lenders were prohibited from making certain changes to the terms and conditions of a credit agreement once executed and from preying on vulnerable populations.



TILA also grants consumers the right to rescind a contract subject to TILA's rules within three days. If the terms of the agreement are not satisfactory or in the consumer's best interest, they may cancel and receive a full refund.




What Does the Truth in Lending Act Do?
The Truth in Lending Act (TILA) helps protect consumers from unfair credit practices by requiring creditors and lenders to pre-disclose to borrowers certain terms, limitations, and provisions—such as the APR, duration of the loan, and the total costs—of a credit agreement or loan.




Who Does the Truth in Lending Act Apply to?
The Truth in Lending Act applies to most types of consumer credit, such as auto loans, mortgages, and credit cards. It does not, however, apply to all credit transactions. For example, TILA does not apply to credit issued to businesses (including agricultural businesses), entities, public utilities, home fuel budget plans, and certain student loan programs.




What Is a Real-Life Example of the Truth in Lending Act?
A real-life example of the Truth in Lending Act includes credit card offers from banks, such as Chase. Chase offers borrowers the opportunity to apply for the airline United Gateway Credit Card on its website. Presented are the pricing and terms, APR (16.49%-23.49% based on creditworthiness), and an annual fee ($0+/-). Required by TILA, the card's pricing and terms disclosure detail the APR for different types of transactions, such as balance transfers and cash advances. It also lists fees of interest to consumers.




What Is a Truth in Lending Agreement?
A Truth in Lending agreement is a written disclosure or set of disclosures provided to the borrower before credit or a loan is issued. It outlines the terms and conditions of the credit, the annual percentage rate (APR), and financing details.




What Is a TILA Volation?
Some examples of TILA violations include a creditor failing to accurately disclose the APR and finance charge, the misapplication of the daily interest factor, and the application of penalty fees exceeding TILA limits. A creditor is also in violation if they do not allow the borrower to rescind the contract within the prescribed limit.


   The Bottom Line  

The Truth in Lending Act (TILA) was signed into law in 1968 as a means to protect consumers from unfair and predatory lending practices. It requires lenders and creditors to supply borrowers with clear and visible key information about the credit extended. TILA prohibits creditors and loan originators from acting in a self-seeking manner, especially when to the detriment of the client. To protect consumers against unfair lending practices, consumers are granted the opportunity to rescind their agreement within a specific time for certain loan transactions. The Truth in Lending Act not only serves to protect consumers but also lenders and creditors who act in good faith.
What Is TSA PreCheck?  

TSA PreCheck is a U.S. government program that allows travelers deemed low-risk by the Transportation Security Administration (TSA), a U.S. Department of Homeland Security agency, to pass through an expedited security screening process at certain U.S. airports. In March 2021 alone, 98% of TSA PreCheck passengers took less than five minutes to pass through security. As of 2021, there are more than 10 million travelers enrolled in the PreCheck program.



Qualifying travelers often have their own special lines at the security checkpoint. They don’t have to remove their belts, shoes, or lightweight jackets. They may also leave a laptop in its case and a 3-1-1 compliant bag (which can contain items with small quantities of liquids and gels, such as a travel-size bottle of mouthwash) in their carry-on luggage, instead of removing it, as regular passengers have to do.





Key Takeaways

TSA PreCheck is a U.S. government program that allows air travelers deemed low-risk to enjoy an expedited security screening process at U.S. airports.TSA PreCheck passengers have shorter lines at airport security; have to remove less clothing; are subject to less-rigorous scans, and other conveniences.You can start the TSA PreCheck application online, but an in-person appointment for fingerprinting and background check is also required.TSA PreCheck status costs $78 and is good for five years.The program began in 2013 and has over 10 million active enrollees as of 2021.


   How TSA PreCheck Works  

The TSA PreCheck program began in Dec. 2013, and is intended to speed up the passage of verified travelers through security checkpoints, which often become crowded as passengers gather to board their flights. Typically, passengers must remove articles of clothing and personal items that could be used to contain hazardous materials.



Shoes, for example, were previously used in attempts to smuggle and detonate explosives on an airplane. Electronic equipment, such as laptops, are also usually subject to scrutiny at checkpoints because of attempts to hide materials inside by removing components.



TSA PreCheck verifies which passengers are present the lowest risk to flight security, so these passengers can pass through security checkpoints without the need to remove shoes, belts, or jackets from their person or laptops and liquids from their bags.


   Applying for TSA PreCheck  

Some 200 airports and 79 airlines offer TSA PreCheck service. You can begin the application process online via the TSA's website. However, you will have to enroll in person, via a visit to one of the more than 380 application centers, where you will be fingerprinted and asked for a valid proof of identity and U.S. citizenship documents. Travelers who are foreign citizens must meet certain residency requirements in order to qualify for the program.



The online application takes less than five minutes, on average, and the in-person appointment takes about 10 minutes.



Once approved for TSA PreCheck status, you will receive a Known Traveler Number (KTN). Use that number any time you book a flight, and you will automatically have your TSA Pre status applied to your boarding pass—it looks like this: TSA Pre✓.



And you can then start using those faster lanes at participating airports reserved for TSA pre-passengers.





$78

The cost of becoming a traveler with TSA PreCheck status. Though the fee is non-refundable, your membership lasts for five years, and is then renewable.


   Cost Coverage With Credit Cards  

Many credit cards provide access to TSA PreCheck as a membership benefit. Some offer periodic statement credits for TSA PreCheck, while others allow their members to pay for the program with their loyalty points. According to the TSA, these cards include:



Bank of America: Premium Rewards credit cardCapital One: Spark Miles Card, Venture Card, and Venture X CardCertain American Express Credit CardsChase Sapphire Reserve CardCiti:  AAdvantage Executive World Elite MasterCard, Prestige CardCommerce Bank® World Elite MastercardDelta SkyMiles Platinum American Express Card, Reserve American Express CardExpedia® Rewards Voyager Card from CitiHSBC: Elite World Elite Mastercard, Premier World MastercardMarriott: Bonvoy, Bonvoy Brilliant American Express CardMasterCard Black Card, MasterCard Gold CardTruist: Business Travel Rewards credit card, Enjoy Beyond credit card, Enjoy Travel credit cardUBS Visa Infinite Credit CardUS Bank: Altitude Reserve Visa Infinite Card, FlexPerks Gold American Express Card


   Other Traveler Programs  

TSA PreCheck only applies to air travel. The Department of Homeland Security operates other federal programs such as Global Entry, NEXUS, and SENTRI for verifying the identities of trusted travelers, and speeding their path through security.



The NEXUS program covers pre-screened travelers who are traveling between Canada and the U.S. by plane, car, or boat. It costs $50.
The SENTRI program governs travel on land into the U.S. from Mexico by air or land. It costs $122.50.
Global Entry lets trusted travelers who are traveling internationally by plane, ship, or auto quickly move through customs and border protection. It costs $100.



For U.S. citizens, membership in these programs membership includes TSA PreCheck status as well.



There are also private programs that can speed up your trip. One of them is Clear, a security technology program that uses biometric data to help identify passengers. Clear is already used in around 50 airports, as well as other locations such as stadiums.





200+

TSA PreCheck is available at over 200 U.S. airports, and over 85 different carriers.


   TSA PreCheck vs. Global Entry vs. Clear  

TSA PreCheck is one of several programs offering a smoother airport experience. It allows trusted U.S. citizens and permanent residents to skip the lines at U.S. airport security. It costs $78 for a five-year membership.



However, TSA PreCheck is only available for flights leaving the U.S. Global Entry is a similar program for international travel, allowing trusted passengers to quickly move through customs and border checkpoints. It costs $100 for five years.



Clear is a private program for identification technology. Rather than have airport officials manually compare passengers to their identification documents, it uses biometric data—such as fingerprints and iris scans—to quickly verify passenger identities, allowing them to move quickly through airport or stadium security. This is more expensive than PreCheck or Global Entry: Clear costs $189, and only lasts for one year.




What Are the Requirements for TSA PreCheck?
The TSA PreCheck Application Program is only open to U.S. citizens, U.S. nationals, and lawful permanent residents. Applicants may be ineligible due to incomplete or false application information, violations of transportation security regulations, or disqualifying criminal offenses.Applicants must fill out an online application and schedule an in-person interview at a regional TSA office for screening. A non-refundable processing fee is also required.




What Are the Benefits of TSA PreCheck?
Travelers who have TSA PreCheck status can enjoy faster-moving dedicated security lines at airports and do not have to remove their shoes, belts, or light jackets. Gels and small liquids may often remain in carry-ons as well as laptops.




How Can I Apply for TSA PreCheck?
First, submit a short online application via the TSA's PreCheck website, then schedule an in-person interview at an enrollment center. Enrollment centers can be found by searching by zip code or address.




Can My Children Join Me on the PreCheck Line?
Yes, children 12 and under can join a parent or legal guardian with TSA PreCheck in the dedicated lanes if traveling together, even if they do not have their own known traveler number.




Is TSA PreCheck a Security Vulnerability?
The TSA argues that TSA PreCheck is safe and all enrollees are fully-vetted and undergo recurrent criminal history checks. Critics have argued that the vetting process is flawed and that those with bad intent can falsify statements made during in-person interviews. Still, there have not been any known security incidents related to PreCheck since its inception in 2013.


   The Bottom Line  

Since 2013, the TSA PreCheck program has allowed enrollees to speed through airport security via dedicated lanes that have less stringent screening criteria. The program is available to all U.S. citizens and legal residents who do not have a criminal history. To enroll, there is an online application and in-person interview. The application costs $78 and enrollment lasts five years, after which time it can be renewed for additional 5-year periods.
What Is a Turnaround?  

When a company that has experienced a period of poor performance moves into a period of a financial recovery, it's called a turnaround. A turnaround may also refer to the recovery of a nation or region's economy after a period of recession or stagnation. Similarly, it can refer to the recovery of an individual whose personal financial situation improves after some time.





Key Takeaways

A turnaround is the financial recovery of a poorly performing company, economy, or individual.Turnarounds are important as they mark a period of improvement while bringing stability to an entity's future. To create a turnaround, an entity must acknowledge problems, consider changes, and develop and implement a problem-solving strategy.


   How to Affect a Turnaround  

Turnarounds are important because they mark an upward shift or improvement for an entity after it experiences a significant period of negativity. The turnaround is akin to a restructuring process where the entity converts the period of loss into one of profitability and success while stabilizing its future. In investing, the term can mean the amount of elapsed time between the placing and fulfilling of an order.



Turnarounds may happen on many levels from the individual to a country's economy or even be a global event. The term indicates a phase when an entity begins to experience steady and positive financial or performance recovery after a time of decline.



In most cases, the first step in moving into a turnaround phase is to acknowledge the problems creating a downturn. In the case of a business, they may examine changes in management or problem identification and solving strategies. In dire situations, the best action may be to liquidate the company.


   Special Considerations  

There are specific features that will usually identify an entity in need of a turnaround. For a business, these may include declines in the price of its stock, the need to layoff employees, and revenues that do not cover requirements to pay creditors.



Changes in a firm's competitive advantage and outdated products or service may also be indicative of a business that needs to investigate turnaround strategies. Also, bad management of resources such as labor and capital may put pressure on the company. 



A stock speculator may profit from a turnaround if they accurately anticipate the improvement of a poorly performing company.


  Catalysts for a Turnaround  

Seldom do turnarounds happen in isolation but instead are the result of internal and external forces. Internally, more attention may be paid to the problems in processes, spending, management, and other factors that created a situation of decline.



Externally, the business may find new regulations that have provided them with a lower cost of production materials that can lead to higher profits. A turnaround management team will review the primary causes of the company’s failure and devise a strategic plan that may include restructuring or repositioning the business.


   Example of a Turnaround  

The U.S. economy experienced a recession in 2009 after the subprime mortgage crisis led to the collapse of the U.S. housing bubble. The crisis led to the collapse of some of the country's—and the world's—biggest banks. The economy began experiencing a turnaround about a year later after the federal government responded with a series of bailouts and a stimulus package.



Declining sales leading up to the financial crisis followed by a tightened lending environment for auto sales were two factors that significantly slowed revenue and earnings for U.S. automakers. In the late 2000s, the auto industry suffered troubled times.



In 2009, General Motors (GM) declared bankruptcy as a result of the crisis, and its stock was delisted from trading.﻿﻿ Bailout funds and its bankruptcy helped the company restore its manufacturing production and sales. In 2010, after a complete reorganization, GM’s stock began trading again with increased production and sales.﻿﻿
What Is a Turnkey Asset Management Program (TAMP)?  

A turnkey asset management program offers a fee-account technology platform that financial advisers, broker-dealers, insurance companies, banks, law firms, and CPA firms can use to oversee their clients’ investment accounts.



Turnkey asset management programs are designed to help financial professionals save time and allow them to focus on providing clients with service in their areas of expertise, which may not include asset management tasks like investment research and portfolio allocation. In other words, TAMPs let financial professionals and firms delegate asset management and research responsibilities to another party that specializes in those areas.





Key Takeaways

Turnkey asset management programs are fee-based platforms for asset managers, broker-dealers, CPAs, and other financial professionals.TAMPs can offer technology, back-office support, and tasks like investment research and asset allocation.Envestnet, SEI, AssetMark, Brinker Capital, and Orion Portfolio Solutions are examples of TAMP providers.Turnkey asset management programs can help firms save time and allow them to focus more of their energy on finding new clients and servicing existing ones.By working with a third party, the user of a turnkey asset management program is giving up some control of some of the decision-making process, while also paying a fee for the service.


   Understanding Turnkey Asset Management Programs (TAMPs)  

Delegating the role of asset manager to a TAMP can help financial professionals and firms to increase profitability by freeing up more time for tasks like attracting new clients and meeting with clients in person. These programs can also save their clients money because developing a proprietary asset management system can be expensive, especially if the company does not already have one in place. TAMPs also handle account administration, billing, and reporting.



Using TAMPs also helps wealth advisers limit their risk of being sued for poor investment performance. By outsourcing investment selection and management, firms can transfer part of that risk to the TAMP. Major turnkey asset management program providers include Envestnet, SEI, AssetMark Investment Services, Brinker Capital, and Orion Portfolio Solutions.


   Types of Turnkey Asset Management Programs (TAMPs)  

Mutual fund wraps, exchange traded fund wraps, separately managed accounts, unified managed accounts, and unified managed households are five types of turnkey asset management programs.


  1. Mutual Fund Wrap Accounts  

A mutual fund wrap account is a TAMP that offers many mutual funds with the fees encompassing "wrapping around" all of the investor's mutual fund trading, rather than having to pay individual fees for each mutual fund, thereby reducing overall fees.


  2. Exchange Traded Fund Wrap Accounts  

Exchange traded fund (ETF) wrap accounts work in the same manner as mutual fund wrap accounts but investment choices are limited only to ETFs as opposed to mutual funds.


  3. Separately Managed Accounts (SMAs)  

Separately managed accounts (SMA) are geared to high-level investors—those with a significant amount of capital available for investing. SMAs operate similarly to mutual funds except where a mutual fund is owned by pooled investors, a separately managed account is owned only by one investor.


  4. Unified Managed Accounts (UMAs)  

Unified managed accounts hold a variety of different investments that are allocated to their own bucket. One bucket would have stocks, for example, while another bucket would have bonds, and another would have derivatives. UMAs aggregate the entirety of an investor's assets but allow them to be managed separately.


  5. Unified Managed Household (UMH)  

As the name implies, a UMH is designed to handle the investments of multiple individuals of one household. This would include parents and children and possibly grandparents if they are in the same household.


   Special Considerations  

TAMPs are available in both off-the-shelf and customized varieties. They are often privately labeled, meaning that it is not apparent to clients that a third party is handling their investments. In addition, these programs serve all types of investors, from mass-market, lower net worth clients to ultra-high-net-worth individuals.



TAMPs provide base technology and additional “back office” support, such as setting up automated alerts, asset tracking and reporting, and other dashboard features. The service might also include supplying proposals, wealth management tools, compliance services, investment policy statements, and might also conduct a risk analysis.






TAMPs typically charge between 0.45% and 2.5% for their services.



These benefits can greatly improve an investment advisory firm, but they come with costs, and managers need to determine whether that additional cost is worth what they get in return, which includes time saved to be able to generate more business.


   Advantages and Disadvantages of TAMPs  

TAMPs provide a significant advantage to advisors as they allow for the outsourcing of a variety of functions, such as reporting, that frees up a significant amount of time for an advisor that they can use to gain more clients or spend more time focusing on their client's investments, which benefits the client in the end.



TAMPs can also be cost-effective. By outsourcing functions to a TAMP, an advisor will avoid the cost of having to set up such functions in-house, which can include hiring more employees, providing more benefits, and so on. In the end, this could reduce their overhead; savings that they can technically pass onto their clients.



As an investor, it's important to understand your fee structure. If your advisor uses a TAMP, check to see if the fees they pay are passed onto you or not. If so, that could be a disadvantage, making your investments more costly.



When an advisor uses a TAMP, the advisor has less control of the investment strategy. It's important to check if the TAMPs investment strategy mirrors that of your risk tolerance and investment goals.


   Turnkey Asset Management Programs (TAMPs) FAQs  
  What Are the Largest TAMPs?  

The largest TAMPs are Mount Yale Capital Group, Adhesion Wealth, Matson Money, Sawtooth Solutions, Orion Portfolio, Brinker Capital, Buckingham Strategic Partners, AssetMark, Independent Advisor Solution by SEI, and Envestnet.


  How Do You Pick A TAMP?  

Choosing the right TAMP as an advisor is based on a lot of factors. Consider how the TAMP aligns with your investment strategy, the type of relationship the TAMP will have with your custodian, the fees the TAMP charges, if the TAMP works on your internal platform, what additional services does the TAMP provide, what is their support management like, and do they offer additional technology.


  When Did Turnkey Asset Management Programs Start?  

Turnkey asset management programs started in the early 1980s.


   The Bottom Line  

Turnkey asset management programs (TAMPs) are investment solutions that financial institutions can use to help manage their client's investment accounts. TAMPs are fee-based services and can provide investment advisors with a handful of services to help them better their services. In choosing a TAMP, an advisor should consider the costs, investment strategies, and other services the TAMP provides to determine whether it is the right solution for them and for their clients.
What Is a Turnkey Business?  

A turnkey business is a business that is ready to use, existing in a condition that allows for immediate operation.



The term "turnkey" is based on the concept of only needing to turn the key to unlock the doors to begin operations. To be fully considered a turnkey solution, the business must function correctly and at full capacity from the moment when it is initially received.


   How Turnkey Businesses Work  

A turnkey business is an arrangement where the provider assumes responsibility for all required setup and ultimately provides the business to the new operator only upon completion of the aforementioned requirements. A turnkey business often already has a proven, successful business model and merely requires investment capital and labor.






The term refers to a corporate buyer just having to "turn" a "key" to commence business activity.



A turnkey business is thus a business that is ready to use, existing in a condition that allows for immediate operation. The term "turnkey" is based on the concept of only needing to turn the key to unlock the doors to begin operations. To be fully considered turnkey, the business must function correctly and at full capacity from when it is initially received. The turnkey cost of such a business may involve franchising fees, rent, insurance, inventory, and so on.





Key Takeaways

A turnkey business is a for-profit operation that is ready to use as-is the moment it is purchased by a new owner or proprietor.The term "turnkey" is based on the concept of only needing to turn the key to unlock the doors to begin operations, or to put the key in the ignition to drive the vehicle.Turnkey businesses include franchises, multi-level marketing schemes, and certain real estate investments, among others.


   Turnkey Businesses and Franchises  

Often used in franchising, a firm's high-level management plans and executes all business strategies to ensure that individuals can buy a franchise or business and start operating immediately. Most franchises are built within a specific pre-existing framework, with predetermined supply lines for the goods required to begin operations. Franchises may not have to participate in advertising decisions, as those may be governed by a larger corporate body.



The advantage of purchasing a franchise is that the business model is generally considered to be proven, resulting in a lower overall failure rate. Some corporate entities ensure that no other franchise is set up within the territory of an existing franchise, limiting internal competition.



The disadvantage of a franchise is that the nature of the operations may be highly restrictive. A franchisee may be subject to contractual obligations, such as items that can or cannot be offered, or where supplies may be purchased.


  Direct Sales and Multi-Level Marketing  

Direct sales and multi-level marketing (MLM) businesses, such as Mary Kay, can also be seen as turnkey businesses based on how little it takes to have them up and running. Often, a person only needs to sign up for the particular service as a consultant and pay fees for the inventory required to perform the work.



A consultant is not an employee of the company; instead, the consultant functions as an independent entity. Profits are made based on the difference between the supply costs and the price at which the items are ultimately sold.


  Other Turnkey Businesses  

Aside from franchises, any existing business that's already up and running successfully or a new business whose doors are ready to be opened could be considered a turnkey business. In these cases, if the business has a proven track record, the risk may be lower compared to starting a new business from scratch, and it may also provide more control over business decisions than a franchise model.



However, it may be challenging to get an accurate valuation before the business is purchased, as well as information about why the business is for sale. There are no preset methods for increasing the likelihood of success in cases where the current performance of the business is lacking in some way.


  Turnkey Properties  

A turnkey property is a fully renovated home or apartment building that an investor can purchase and immediately rent out. Turnkey properties are typically purchased from companies that specialize in the restoration of older properties. Those same firms may also offer property management services to buyers, minimizing the amount of time and effort they have to put into the rental.



This investment approach is especially appealing to individuals who desire exposure to the real estate market but who do not have the time or ability/interest to renovate a home or handle maintenance issues. In most cases, the investor will hire a separate company to manage the property.
What Is a Turnkey Property?  

A turnkey property is a fully renovated home or apartment building that an investor can purchase and immediately rent out. A turnkey home is often a property purchased from a company that specializes in the restoration of older properties. Those same firms may also offer property management services to buyers, minimizing the amount of time and effort they have to put into the rental.


   How a Turnkey Property Works  

Turnkey properties grew in popularity following the housing market decline of 2007- 2008 when it became cheaper to buy homes than rent them in most parts of the United States. In fact, nationwide, buying is 30% cheaper than renting, and in many low-cost-of-living regions, it’s even cheaper than that. In markets where real estate is particularly expensive, such as New York, investors will often seek to create revenue streams by buying rental properties in parts of the country where property is cheaper, and hiring property managers to take care of the rentals for them, leaving them to do little more than collect profits from afar.





Key Takeaways

Turnkey properties have often been renovated and repaired.Turnkey homes have become popular investments.New buyers usually rent out the properties to generate revenue.



This investment approach is especially appealing to individuals who desire exposure to the real estate market but who do not have the time or ability/interest to renovate a home or handle maintenance issues. In most cases, the investor will hire a separate company to manage the property. Often, there will already be a tenant in the property when it changes hands, simplifying matters for the investor even further.



The term turnkey property is not used solely by investors, however. In marketing literature, realty companies sometimes use the phrase to describe any renovated, move-in ready home that is up for sale. While some homebuyers relish the thought of renovating a property themselves, those with busy lifestyles, or who lack home improvement skills, may prefer a turnkey property that needs no work.


   How a Turnkey Property Is Used to Generate Revenue  

The purchase of turnkey property is expected to allow the new buyer to make it available for tenants immediately. By acquiring real estate that requires little to no refurbishment, the intent is to quickly generate revenue through renting the property as quickly as possible. The extent of the work necessary to bring a residence to turnkey status can include replacement of electrical fixtures, repairs to plumbing, fresh paint for the interior, and fixes to the flooring where necessary. The shorter the turnaround to rent the property, the faster the new buyer may start seeing a return on their investment.



The effectiveness and worth of fully renovating a home or other dwelling may be questioned if the goal is to put the property up for sale rather than for rent. The expenses that may be put toward repairs and, say, fresh paint might not be a selling point as prospective buyers could want to make alterations to the property. That could include tearing out or doing away with the very refurbishment done by the current owner. Also, the money spent making those repairs will likely increase the asking price of the seller. In some instances, particularly for selling a residence, it may be more efficient to see that repairs are done that bring the building up to code, but little more.
What is a Turnkey Solution?  

A turnkey solution is a type of system built end-to-end for a customer that can be easily implemented into a current business process. It is immediately ready to use upon implementation and is designed to fulfill a certain process such as manufacturing (in part or whole), billing, website design, training, or content management.



A turnkey solution system is different than a custom-built or designed system. When a company or business isn't looking for multiple bells and whistles, a turnkey solution may be an affordable and simple option.



In a turnkey solution, a corporate buyer just has to "turn" a "key" to commence a business activity in the newly built structure. "Solution" evolved in the turnkey concept as economies became more service-based.





Key Takeaways

Turnkey is a word that can be used to describe a solution, a business, or a property.A turnkey solution is the opposite of a custom-built solution. Turnkey solutions are created to be implemented into a current business process without disruption. Turnkey solutions can save a company time and money when implemented with success. 



A possible drawback of this method, as opposed to designing a process in-house or a custom-built system, is that specifications that are important to a particular company may not be sufficiently integrated into the solution. In-house or custom-built versus turnkey decisions take the complexity of a business process into consideration.






With rapid advances in technology software and hardware, turnkey solutions are popular for businesses that desire speed to market.


   Other Types of Turnkey Terms  

Traditionally, turnkey, as a term, is commonly applied to construction projects, such as warehouses, other purpose-built buildings, or houses. The idea is that the building contractor finishes a product that the buyer can utilize immediately.



A turnkey property is usually a newly renovated and updated apartment building or home that is move-in ready for buyers or renters. Real estate companies, property sellers and buyers, and real estate investors often describe new buildings or homes as "turnkey" ready.



A turnkey business may refer to a business that can be purchased without having to make any changes to the business model or products sold. For example, a franchise like Taco Bell is a type of turnkey business.


   Pros and Cons of Turnkey Solutions  

A turnkey solution may be the most affordable way to construct something end-to-end that is beneficial to multiple users. However, turnkey solutions may not take into account the individual needs of a company. A turnkey solution for content management software offered by a third-party company may be cheaper to purchase, but it may not cover all the needs of the purchaser.


   Example of a Turnkey Solution  

A company looking to implement an online billing feature on its website can use third-party providers to process each transaction and handle all the technical issues surrounding this process. The use of a turnkey solution, in this case, allows the company to avoid the headaches of programming the tool in-house and the approvals associated with developing a billing system from scratch.
What Is Turnover?  

Turnover is an accounting concept that calculates how quickly a business conducts its operations. Most often, turnover is used to understand how quickly a company collects cash from accounts receivable or how fast the company sells its inventory.



Common forms of turnover include accounts receivable turnover, inventory turnover, portfolio turnover, and working capital turnover. Companies can better assess the efficiency of their operations through looking at a range of these ratios, often with the goal of maximizing turnover.



In the investment industry, turnover is defined as the percentage of a portfolio that is sold in a particular month or year. A quick turnover rate generates more commissions for trades placed by a broker.



Overall turnover is a synonym for a company’s total revenues. It is commonly used in Europe and Asia. 





Key Takeaways

Turnover is an accounting concept that calculates how quickly a business conducts its operations.The most common measures of corporate turnover look at ratios involving accounts receivable and inventories. These are called accounts receivable turnover and inventory turnover.Accounts receivable turnover shows how quickly payments are being collected compared with credit sales during a certain time period, such as a month or a year.Inventory turnover is calculated by taking the cost of goods sold (COGS) divided by average inventory, showing how fast a company sells its inventory in a given time period.In the investment industry, turnover is defined as the percentage of a portfolio that is sold in a particular month or year.

   Understanding Turnover  

Two of the largest assets owned by a business are accounts receivable and inventory. Both of these accounts require a large cash investment, and it is important to measure how quickly a business collects cash.



Turnover ratios calculate how quickly a business collects cash from its accounts receivable and inventory investments. These ratios are used by fundamental analysts and investors to determine if a company is deemed a good investment.


   What Is Accounts Receivable Turnover?  

Accounts receivable represents the total dollar amount of unpaid customer invoices at any point in time. Assuming that credit sales are sales not immediately paid in cash, the accounts receivable turnover formula is credit sales divided by average accounts receivable. The average accounts receivable is simply the average of the beginning and ending accounts receivable balances for a particular time period, such as a month or year.



The accounts receivable turnover formula tells you how quickly you are collecting payments, compared with your credit sales. For example, if credit sales for the month total $300,000 and the account receivable balance is $50,000, then the turnover rate is six. The goal is to maximize sales, minimize the receivable balance, and generate a large turnover rate.



Similarly, accounts payable turnover (sales divided by average payables) is a short-term liquidity measure that measures the rate at which a company pays back its suppliers and vendors.


   What Is Inventory Turnover?  

The inventory turnover formula, which is stated as the cost of goods sold (COGS) divided by average inventory, is similar to the accounts receivable formula.



When you sell inventory, the balance is moved to the cost of sales, which is an expense account. The goal as a business owner is to maximize the amount of inventory sold while minimizing the inventory that is kept on hand. As an example, if the cost of sales for the month totals $400,000 and you carry $100,000 in inventory, the turnover rate is four, which indicates that a company sells its entire inventory four times every year.



The inventory turnover, also known as sales turnover, helps investors determine the level of risk that they will face if providing operating capital to a company. For example, a company with a $5 million inventory that takes seven months to sell will be considered less profitable than a company with a $2 million inventory that is sold within two months.






The reciprocal of the inventory turnover ratio (1/inventory turnover) is the days sales of inventory (DSI). This tells you how many days it takes, on average, to completely sell and replace a company’s inventory.


   What Is Portfolio Turnover?  

Turnover is a term that is also used for investments. Assume that a mutual fund has $100 million in assets under management, and the portfolio manager sells $20 million in securities during the year. The rate of turnover is $20 million divided by $100 million, or 20%. A 20% portfolio turnover ratio could be interpreted to mean that the value of the trades represented one-fifth of the assets in the fund.



Portfolios that are actively managed should have a higher rate of turnover, while a passively managed portfolio may have fewer trades during the year. The actively managed portfolio should generate more trading costs, which reduces the rate of return on the portfolio. Investment funds with excessive turnover are often considered to be low quality.




Why can mutual funds with high turnover rates be detrimental?
Funds with high turnover ratios might incur greater transaction costs (such as trading fees and commissions) and generate short-term capital gains, which are taxable at an investor’s ordinary income rate.




What is asset turnover?
The asset turnover ratio is a measure of how well a company generates revenue from its assets during the year.Asset Turnover=Total SalesBeginning Assets + Ending Assets2where:Total Sales=Annual sales totalBeginning Assets=Assets at start of yearEnding Assets=Assets at end of year\begin{aligned} &\text{Asset Turnover} = \frac{ \text{Total Sales} }{ \frac { \text{Beginning Assets}\ +\ \text{Ending Assets} }{ 2 } } \\ &\textbf{where:}\\ &\text{Total Sales} = \text{Annual sales total} \\ &\text{Beginning Assets} = \text{Assets at start of year} \\ &\text{Ending Assets} = \text{Assets at end of year} \\ \end{aligned}​Asset Turnover=2Beginning Assets + Ending Assets​Total Sales​where:Total Sales=Annual sales totalBeginning Assets=Assets at start of yearEnding Assets=Assets at end of year​Investors use the asset turnover ratio to compare similar companies in the same sector or group.




What is working capital turnover?
Working capital turnover measures how effective a business is at generating sales for every dollar of working capital put to use. Working capital represents the difference between a company’s current assets and current liabilities.




What is an example of turnover?
Consider the following inventory turnover example: A company has $100,000 in sales in one month and average inventory of $10,000. The $100,000 in sales is divided by the average inventory of $10,000 to arrive at a turnover of 10. Here, the company turns over its inventory 10 times per month.




What is the difference between turnover and profit?
Profit refers to a company’s total revenues minus its expenses. By contrast, turnover can refer to how quickly a company either has sold its inventory or is collecting payments compared with sales over a specific time period. Generally speaking, turnover looks at the speed and efficiency of a company’s operations.
What Is Turnover Ratio?  

A turnover ratio or turnover rate in investing is the percentage of a mutual fund or other portfolio holdings that have been replaced in the course of one year.



Some funds hold their equity positions for less than 12 months, meaning their turnover ratios exceed 100%. That doesn't necessarily mean that every holding has been replaced. The ratio reflects the proportion of stocks that have changed in one year.





Key Takeaways


The turnover ratio varies by the type of mutual fund, its investment objective, and the portfolio manager's investing style.
The turnover ratio or turnover rate is the percentage of a mutual fund or other portfolio's holdings that have been replaced in a given year.
Funds with high turnover ratios can incur greater costs in trading fees and commissions and may generate short-term capital gains, which are taxable at an investor's ordinary-income rate.



   Understanding Turnover Ratio  

The turnover ratio varies by the type of mutual fund, its investment objective, and the portfolio manager's investing style.



For example, a stock market index fund will have a low turnover rate since it duplicates a particular index and replaces holdings only when the index changes. An actively traded mutual fund may have a high turnover rate, depending on how aggressively its manager buys and sells holdings in search of better returns.



Actively managed mutual funds with a low turnover ratio reflect a buy-and-hold investment strategy. Funds with high turnover ratios indicate an attempt to profit by a market-timing approach.



An aggressive small-cap growth stock fund will generally experience higher turnover than a large-cap value stock fund.





The Different Meanings of "Turnover Ratio"

In the mutual fund industry, turnover ratio is the percentage of the fund's holdings that have been replaced in the course of one year.In business, turnover ratio is a measurement of efficiency, indicating the length of time it takes a business to sell the goods that it has spent money up front to acquire.In a company or industry, turnover ratio is the percentage of employees who leave within a year.


   The Significance of Turnover Ratio  

As a technical indicator, the turnover ratio itself has no intrinsic value. A high turnover ratio is not necessarily bad, nor is a low turnover ratio necessarily good. But investors should be aware of the consequences of turnover frequency.



High turnover often results in increased costs for the fund due to the payment of spreads and commissions when buying and selling stocks. These increased costs are passed on to the investors, and are reflected in the fund's return overall.



Also, the more portfolio turnover in a fund, the more likely it is generate short-term capital gains. These are profits on assets held for less than one year and are taxable at an investor's ordinary-income rate, which is often higher than the capital gains rate.


  How to Read Turnover Ratio  

A mutual fund's turnover ratio shouldn't be the sole basis of a decision to invest or devest in it. However, it can be useful to see how a particular fund's turnover ratio compares with others of the same type of investment approach.



The average turnover ratio for managed mutual funds is 75–115%. So, a conservative-minded equity investor might target funds with turnover ratios under 50%.



If a fund's turnover ratio is significantly out of line with that of comparable funds, it might be something to note.



Say that most funds in a particular sector have turnover ratios around 5%, but one fund posts 25% turnover in one year. In this instance, the investor might want to know why. Did a new portfolio manager come in and decide to wipe the slate clean? Was there a change in the fund's objective?



Or, say that most funds in another sector have 75% turnover ratios, but there is one with a ratio of 35%. Is management there asleep at the wheel?



Turnover ratio alone shouldn't be a deciding factor, but an abnormally high or low ratio among comparable funds is a reason to look harder at the fund's performance over time to see just how successful its strategy has been.


   Formula and Calculation of Turnover Ratio  

The turnover ratio will be listed in the company's prospectus for the mutual fund. It would be difficult for an investor to work it out, since it would require knowing the sales price of every transaction made during the year and the average monthly net value of the fund over 12 months.



The formula is as follows:



Total dollar value of all new portfolio assets (or value of portfolio assets sold, if that is the smaller), divided by monthly average net assets of the fund in dollars, times 100.


   Examples of Turnover Ratio  

The BNY Mellon Appreciation Fund from Fidelity (DGAGX) has a strong buy-and-hold strategy in mostly blue-chip companies with total market capitalizations of over $5 billion at the time of purchase. Those companies show sustained profitability, strong balance sheets, global expansion, and above-average earnings growth, in keeping with the fund's objective of capital preservation. As of year-end 2022, the fund's turnover ratio was a bit over 9.%.



Fidelity's Rydex S&P Small-Cap 600 Pure Growth Fund (RYSGX) invests in the common stock of companies within the capitalization range of the underlying S&P Small-Cap 600 Index and derivative instruments. At least 80% of the fund’s net assets are invested in fast-growing companies or firms in up-and-coming industries, and it seeks to match the index's performance on a daily basis. At the end of March 2022, the Rydex fund had an average turnover ratio of 707%.




What Is a Turnover Ratio in a Business?
Turnover ratio has a variety of meanings outside of the investing world.A turnover ratio in business is a measurement of the firm's efficiency.It is calculated by dividing annual income by annual liability. It can be applied to the cost of inventory or any other business cost.Unlike in investing, a high turnover ratio in business is almost always a good sign. It may show, for example, that the business is selling its stock out as quickly as it can get it in.




What Is a Turnover Ratio in a Company?
Perhaps the most common use of a turnover ratio is to measure the proportion of a company's employees who are replaced during a year.A low employee turnover rate indicates that people seldom leave the company. A high turnover rate means they're fleeing in large numbers.There's no good or bad turnover rate. Some industries have high turnover rates by their nature. Information technology has a high turnover ratio because its employees are in high demand elsewhere. The retail and hospitality industries have high turnover ratios because their jobs are ill-paid and tough to do.




How Do I Check the Turnover Ratio for My Mutual Fund?
You should find turnover ratio (or turnover rate) in the issuing company's latest financial statement on the mutual fund.For example, Vanguard lists the turnover rate for its Vanguard Health Care Fund Investor Shares as 14.9% as of Feb. 28, 2023. It is an item in its "Fundamental" list for the fund.


   The Bottom Line  

Turnover ratio alone won't help you determine whether a mutual fund is the right choice for you. It simply tells you what percentage of stocks and other assets in the fund have been replaced in the course of the year.



It could be relevant to your research into mutual funds, however. If comparable mutual funds have higher or lower turnover ratios than the fund you're looking at, it's a signal to look further into the fund's performance. You may find that it's achieving better returns over time due to all of that activity, or lack of activity. If it's not, you might look at rival funds for a better choice.
What Is a Tweezer?  

A tweezer is a technical analysis pattern, commonly involving two candlesticks, that can signify either a market top or bottom.





Key Takeaways

A tweezer is a technical analysis pattern, commonly involving two candlesticks, that can signify either a market top or bottom.Tweezer bottoms are considered to be short-term bullish reversal patterns, whereas tweezer tops are thought to be bearish reversals.Tweezers were made mainstream in Steve Nison's popular candlestick charting book Japanese Candlestick Charting Techniques.


   Understanding Tweezers  

Tweezer patterns are reversal patterns and occur when two or more candlesticks touch the same bottom for a tweezer bottom pattern, or when two or more candlesticks touch the same top for a tweezer top pattern.



Tweezer bottoms are considered to be short-term bullish reversal patterns, whereas tweezer tops are thought to be bearish reversals. Essentially, with both formations, either buyers or sellers were not able to push the top or bottom any further. Both types of patterns require close observation and research to be interpreted and used correctly.



A bearish tweezer top occurs during an uptrend when bulls push prices higher, often ending the day near the highs (generally considered a strong bullish signal). Then, on the following (second) day, traders reverse their market sentiment. The market opens, does not breach the prior day's highs, and heads straight down, often eliminating most of the prior period's gains.On the flip side, a bullish tweezer bottom is realized during a downtrend when bears continue to drive prices lower, closing the day near lows (usually a strong bearish trend). Again, Day 2 is a reversal, as prices open, do not breach the prior day's lows, and head sharply higher. A bullish advance on Day 2 can quickly eliminate losses from the previous trading day.






A tweezers top is identified by two candles with similar highs occurring back to back. A tweezers bottom would see two candles instead with similar back-to-back lows.


   Special Considerations  

As an investment strategy, tweezers offer traders a level of precision when seeking to take advantage of market trends. While tweezers can take on a variety of appearances, they all have a couple of traits in common: Sometimes appearing at market turning points, these candlestick patterns can be used for analysis purposes—to simply indicate the possibility of a reversal—or they can be used within a broader context of market analysis to provide trade signals for trend traders.



Tweezers were made mainstream in Steve Nison's popular candlestick charting book Japanese Candlestick Charting Techniques. Candlestick methods are characterized by the body of a candle which is created by the difference between the open and close, while the thin "shadows" on either end of the candle mark the high and low over that period. Typically, a dark, or red, candle indicates the close was below the open, while a white or green candle highlights the price closing higher than it opened.



As with any other trading tool or indicator, tweezers should be used in conjunction with other indicators or market signals.

What Is the 28/36 Rule?  

The 28/36 rule refers to a common-sense approach used to calculate the amount of debt an individual or household should assume. A household should spend a maximum of 28% of its gross monthly income on total housing expenses according to this rule, and no more than 36% on total debt service. This includes housing and other debt such as car loans and credit cards.



Lenders often use this rule to assess whether to extend credit to borrowers.





Key Takeaways

The 28/36 rule helps determine how much debt a household can safely take on based on their income, other debts, and lifestyle.Some consumers may use the 28/36 rule when planning their monthly budgets.Following the 28/36 rule can help to improve your chances of credit approval even if a consumer isn't immediately applying for credit.Many underwriters vary their parameters around the 28/36 rule, with some requiring lower percentages and some requiring higher percentages.


   Understanding the 28/36 Rule  

Lenders use varying criteria to determine whether to approve credit applications. One of the main considerations is an individual's credit score. Lenders usually require that a credit score must fall within a certain range, but a credit score is not the only consideration. Lenders also consider a borrower’s income and debt-to-income (DTI) ratio.



Another factor is the 28/36 rule, which is an important calculation that determines a consumer's financial status. It helps determine how much debt a consumer can safely assume based on their income, other debts, and financial needs. The premise is that debt loads over the 28/36 parameters are likely difficult for an individual or household to sustain. They may eventually lead to default.



This rule is a guide that lenders use to structure underwriting requirements. Some lenders may vary these parameters based on a borrower’s credit score, potentially allowing high credit score borrowers to have slightly higher DTI ratios.






Most traditional mortgage lenders require a maximum household expense-to-income ratio of 28% and a maximum total debt-to-income ratio of 36% for loan approval.



Lenders that use the 28/36 rule in their credit assessments may include questions about housing expenses and comprehensive debt accounts in their credit applications.


   Special Considerations  

The 28/36 rule is a standard that most lenders use before advancing any credit, so consumers should be aware of the rule before they apply for any type of loan. Lenders pull credit checks for every application they receive. These hard inquiries show up on a consumer's credit report. Having multiple inquiries over a short period can affect a consumer's credit score and may hinder their chance of getting credit in the future.


   Example of the 28/36 Rule  

Let's say an individual or family brings home a monthly income of $5,000. They could budget up to $1,400 for a monthly mortgage payment and housing expenses if they want to adhere to the 28/36 rule. But it would leave an additional $800 for making other types of loan repayments if they confined their housing expenses to just $1,000 or 20%,




What Is Gross Income?
Your gross income is your income from all sources before any taxes, retirement contributions, or employee benefits have been withheld or deducted. The balance after these deductions is referred to as your "net" income. This is the amount you receive in your paychecks. The 28/36 rule is based on your gross monthly income.




What Is Included in Housing Expenses?
Lenders will typically include in your monthly mortgage payment, property taxes, homeowners insurance premiums, and homeowners association fees, if any, in your housing expenses. Some lenders may include your utilities, too, but this would generally be categorized as contributing to your total debts.




How Is My Debt-to-Income Ratio Calculated?
Your debt-to-income ratio is calculated by dividing all your monthly debt payments by your gross monthly income. Your debt payments include your mortgage, any auto loan(s) and payments toward credit cards, personal loans, student loans, and home equity loans.


   The Bottom Line  

Each lender establishes its own parameters for housing debt and total debt as a part of its underwriting process. This process is what ultimately determines if you'll qualify for a loan. Household expense payments (primarily rent or mortgage payments) can be no more than 28% of your gross income, and your total debt payments cannot exceed 36% of your income to meet the 28/36 rule.



You might be granted some leeway if you have a very good to excellent credit score, so consider working to improve your score if your 28/36 calculation is borderline.
What Is Two and Twenty?  

Two and twenty (or "2 and 20") is a fee arrangement that is standard in the hedge fund industry and is also common in venture capital and private equity. Hedge fund management companies typically charge clients both a management and a performance fee. "Two" means 2% of assets under management (AUM), and refers to the annual management fee charged by the hedge fund for managing assets. "Twenty" refers to the standard performance or incentive fee of 20% of profits made by the fund above a certain predefined benchmark. While this lucrative fee arrangement has resulted in many hedge fund managers becoming extremely wealthy, in recent years the fee structure has come under fire from investors and politicians for varying reasons.





Key Takeaways

Two refers to the standard management fee of 2% of assets annually, while 20 means the incentive fee of 20% of profits above a certain threshold known as the hurdle rate. This lucrative fee arrangement has resulted in many hedge fund managers becoming multi-millionaires or even billionaires, but has come under close scrutiny from investors and politicians in recent years. A high watermark may be applicable to the performance fee; it specifies that the fund manager will only be paid a percentage of profits if the fund's net value exceeds its previous highest value. 






   How Two and Twenty Works  

The 2% management fee is paid to hedge fund managers regardless of the fund’s performance. A hedge fund manager with $1 billion AUM earns $20 million in management fees annually even if the fund performs poorly. The 20% performance fee is charged if the fund achieves a level of performance that exceeds a certain base threshold known as the hurdle rate. The hurdle rate could either be a preset percentage, or may be based on a benchmark such as the return on an equity or bond index.



Some hedge funds also have to contend with a high watermark that is applicable to their performance fee. A high watermark policy specifies that the fund manager will only be paid a percentage of the profits if the fund's net value exceeds its previous highest value. This precludes the fund manager from being paid large sums for poor performance and ensures that any losses must be made up before performance fees are paid out.

The giant hedge funds founded by these fund titans grew so large that they generated hundreds of millions in management fees alone. Their successful strategies over many years - if not decades - have also earned these funds billions in performance fees. While the steep fees charged by star hedge fund managers may be justified by their sustained outperformance, the billion-dollar question is whether the majority of fund managers generate sufficient returns to justify their Two and Twenty fee model.


   Is Two and Twenty Justified?  

Jim Simons, the highest-paid hedge fund manager in recent years, founded Renaissance Technologies in 1982. An award-winning mathematician (and former NSA code breaker), Simons established Renaissance as a quant fund that employs sophisticated quantitative models and techniques in its trading strategies. One of the world’s most successful hedge funds, Renaissance is best known for the tremendous returns generated by its flagship Medallion fund. Simons launched Medallion in 1988 and over the next 30 years, it generated an average annual return of about 40%, including an average return of 71.8% annually between 1994 and 2014. Those returns are after Renaissance's management fees of 5% and performance fees of 44%. Medallion has been closed to outside investors since 2005 and currently only manages money for Renaissance employees. Renaissance had $75 billion in AUM as of April 2020, so even though Simons stepped down as its head in 2010, those outsized fees should continue contributing to the growth in his net worth.



But such stellar performances tend to be the exception rather than the norm in the hedge fund industry. While hedge funds, by definition, are expected to make money in any market because of their ability to go long and short, their performance has lagged equity indices for years. In the ten years from 2009 to 2018, hedge funds had an average annualized return of 6.09 percent, according to data provider Hedge Fund Research (HFR), less than half of the S&P 500's 15.82% annual return over this period. In 2018, hedge funds returned -4.07% versus the S&P 500's total return (including dividends ) of -4.38%.






Based on data from HFR, an analysis by CNBC revealed that 2018 was the first time in a decade that hedge funds had outperformed the S&P 500, although only by a wafer-thin margin.



Warren Buffett, in his February 2017 letter to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders, estimated that the search by the financial "elite" - such as wealthy individuals, pension funds and college endowments, all of whom tend to be typical hedge fund investors - for superior investment advice has caused it to waste more than $100 billion in aggregate over the past decade.﻿﻿


   Two and Twenty Updated  

Chronic underperformance and high fees are causing investors to bail out of hedge funds, with a net $94.3 billion withdrawn since the beginning of 2016. Strong performances by most markets enabled hedge fund industry assets to increase by $78.8 billion in the first quarter of 2019 to $3.18 trillion globally, about 2% below the record level of $3.24 in the third quarter of 2018, according to HFR.



The proliferation of hedge funds, with more than 11,000 estimated to be in operation today compared with fewer than 1,000 funds 30 years ago, has also resulted in some downward pressure on fees. The average fund currently charges a management fee of 1.5% and 17% performance fee, compared with 1.6% and 20% 10 years ago.



Hedge fund managers are also coming under pressure from politicians who want to reclassify performance fees as ordinary income for tax purposes, rather than capital gains. While the 2% management fee charged by hedge fees is treated as ordinary income, the 20% fee is treated as capital gains because the returns are typically not paid out but are treated as if they were reinvested with the fund investors' monies. This "carried interest" in the fund enables high-income managers in hedge funds, venture capital and private equity to have this income stream taxed at the capital gains rate of 23.8%, instead of the top ordinary rate of 37%. In March 2019, Congressional Democrats reintroduced legislation to end the much-reviled "carried interest" tax break.﻿﻿


   An Example of Two and Twenty   

Assume hypothetical hedge fund Peak-to-Trough Investments (PTI) had $1 billion in AUM at the beginning of Year 1, and is closed to investors. The fund's AUM grows to $1.15 billion at the end of Year 1, but by the end of Year 2, AUM falls to $920 million, before rebounding to $1.25 billion by the end of Year 3. If the fund charges the standard "Two and Twenty", the total annual fees made by the fund at the end of each year can be calculated as follows -



Year 1:



Fund AUM at beginning of Year 1 = $1,000M



Fund AUM at end of Year 1 = $1,150M



Management fee = 2% of year-end AUM = $23M



Performance fee = 20% of fund growth = $150M x 20% = $30M



Total fund fees = $23M +$30M = $53M



Year 2:



Fund AUM at beginning of Year 2 = $1,150M



Fund AUM at end of Year 2 = $920M



Management fee = 2% of year-end AUM = $18.4M



Performance fee = Not payable as high watermark of $1,150M has not been exceeded



Total fund fees = $18.4M



Year 3:



Fund AUM at beginning of Year 3 = $920M



Fund AUM at end of Year 3 = $1,250M



Management fee = 2% of year-end AUM = $25M



Performance fee = 20% of fund growth above high watermark = $100M x 20% = $20M



Total fund fees = $25M +$20M = $45M
What Is Two-Bin Inventory Control?  

Two-bin inventory control is a system used to determine when items or materials used in production should be replenished. When items in the first bin have been depleted, an order is placed to refill or replace them. The second bin is then supposed to have enough items to last until the order for the first bin arrives. In short, the first bin has a minimum of working stock, and the second bin keeps reserve stock or remaining material.



The two-bin inventory control method is also sometimes referred to as kanban, which is strongly associated with the just-in-time (JIT) method of a manufacturing process.





Key Takeaways

Two-bin inventory control is a system used to determine when items or materials used in production should be replenished.When items in the first bin have been depleted, an order is placed to replace them. During the wait, items from the second bin are used.Two-bin inventory control is almost always used for small or low-value items that can be easily purchased and stored in bulk.Bin cards and store ledger cards are used to record the inventory.The two-bin inventory control system ensures that companies reduce inventory risks and always have the right level of stock to meet demand.


   How Two-Bin Inventory Control Works  

Effectively managing stock levels is one of the biggest challenges that companies face. Not having enough inventory can result in missing out on sales opportunities and losing out to competitors. Holding too much stock, on the other hand, increases the possibility of damage, spoilage, theft, and falling victim to shifts in demand. It also means higher storage costs and delays recouping money from purchased goods to reinvest in the business.



The two-bin inventory control system is a basic technique used to ensure that companies reduce these risks and always have, more or less, the right level of stock to meet demand without overdoing it.



In its simplest form, the process can be broken down like this:



The first bin is placed on top or in front of the second bin.A reorder card is placed on the bottom of both bins.Stock is taken from the more accessible first bin.When the first bin is empty it is replaced with the second bin.The reorder card is used to restock the first bin.When the ordered stock arrives it is placed in the empty bin and the process repeats itself.



This system is broadly employed across different industries that involve manufacturing operations and is also effective for hospital inventory control. 


   Special Considerations  

Two-bin inventory control is almost always used for small or low-value items that can be easily purchased and stored in bulk. In contrast, higher-value items are subject to the perpetual inventory system. 



Moreover, depending on historical patterns of variance in the depletion rate of the working stock (bin no. 1), the amount ordered for the reserve stock (bin no. 2) can be adjusted.



It is essential that the new order placed after the first bin is emptied arrives before the second bin is empty, otherwise, the process does not work as intended. The inventory approach used for both bins is first in, first out (FIFO), given that the inventory placed in the first bin is also the inventory that is first sold.



In general, the following calculation is used to determine how much inventory to keep in the reserve stock bin:



(Daily usage rate * lead time) + safety stock


   Example of Two-Bin Inventory Control  

Company A is a small manufacturer that goes through various types of nuts and bolts to piece together its products. Fasteners are among the many items it orders from outside suppliers. It uses roughly 800 of them per week, or 160 per day, with a lead time—the period between the beginning and completion of a production process—of three days.



According to the first calculation above, company A’s reserve bin should stock at least 480 fasteners. However, management is also aware that usage levels can sometimes fluctuate by as much as 15%, so as a precautionary measure chooses to add some more fasteners to its reserve storage bin. This safety stock could come in handy if demand picks up and production rates increase, as they have in the past.
What Is a Two-Tailed Test?  

A two-tailed test, in statistics, is a method in which the critical area of a distribution is two-sided and tests whether a sample is greater than or less than a certain range of values. It is used in null-hypothesis testing and testing for statistical significance. If the sample being tested falls into either of the critical areas, the alternative hypothesis is accepted instead of the null hypothesis.





Key Takeaways

In statistics, a two-tailed test is a method in which the critical area of a distribution is two-sided and tests whether a sample is greater or less than a range of values.It is used in null-hypothesis testing and testing for statistical significance.If the sample being tested falls into either of the critical areas, the alternative hypothesis is accepted instead of the null hypothesis.By convention two-tailed tests are used to determine significance at the 5% level, meaning each side of the distribution is cut at 2.5%.


   Understanding a Two-Tailed Test  

A basic concept of inferential statistics is hypothesis testing, which determines whether a claim is true or not given a population parameter. A hypothesis test that is designed to show whether the mean of a sample is significantly greater than and significantly less than the mean of a population is referred to as a two-tailed test. The two-tailed test gets its name from testing the area under both tails of a normal distribution, although the test can be used in other non-normal distributions.



A two-tailed test is designed to examine both sides of a specified data range as designated by the probability distribution involved. The probability distribution should represent the likelihood of a specified outcome based on predetermined standards. This requires the setting of a limit designating the highest (or upper) and lowest (or lower) accepted variable values included within the range. Any data point that exists above the upper limit or below the lower limit is considered out of the acceptance range and in an area referred to as the rejection range.



There is no inherent standard about the number of data points that must exist within the acceptance range. In instances where precision is required, such as in the creation of pharmaceutical drugs, a rejection rate of 0.001% or less may be instituted. In instances where precision is less critical, such as the number of food items in a product bag, a rejection rate of 5% may be appropriate.


   Special Considerations  

A two-tailed test can also be used practically during certain production activities in a firm, such as with the production and packaging of candy at a particular facility. If the production facility designates 50 candies per bag as its goal, with an acceptable distribution of 45 to 55 candies, any bag found with an amount below 45 or above 55 is considered within the rejection range.



To confirm the packaging mechanisms are properly calibrated to meet the expected output, random sampling may be taken to confirm accuracy. A simple random sample takes a small, random portion of the entire population to represent the entire data set, where each member has an equal probability of being chosen.



For the packaging mechanisms to be considered accurate, an average of 50 candies per bag with an appropriate distribution is desired. Additionally, the number of bags that fall within the rejection range needs to fall within the probability distribution limit considered acceptable as an error rate. Here, the null hypothesis would be that the mean is 50 while the alternate hypothesis would be that it is not 50.



If, after conducting the two-tailed test, the z-score falls in the rejection region, meaning that the deviation is too far from the desired mean, then adjustments to the facility or associated equipment may be required to correct the error. Regular use of two-tailed testing methods can help ensure production stays within limits over the long term.






Be careful to note if a statistical test is one- or two-tailed as this will greatly influence a model's interpretation.


   Two-Tailed vs. One-Tailed Test  

When a hypothesis test is set up to show that the sample mean would be higher or lower than the population mean, this is referred to as a one-tailed test. The one-tailed test gets its name from testing the area under one of the tails (sides) of a normal distribution. When using a one-tailed test, an analyst is testing for the possibility of the relationship in one direction of interest, and completely disregarding the possibility of a relationship in another direction.



If the sample being tested falls into the one-sided critical area, the alternative hypothesis will be accepted instead of the null hypothesis. A one-tailed test is also known as a directional hypothesis or directional test.



A two-tailed test, on the other hand, is designed to examine both sides of a specified data range to test whether a sample is greater than or less than the range of values.


   Example of a Two-Tailed Test  

As a hypothetical example, imagine that a new stockbroker, named XYZ, claims that their brokerage fees are lower than that of your current stockbroker, ABC) Data available from an independent research firm indicates that the mean and standard deviation of all ABC broker clients are $18 and $6, respectively.



A sample of 100 clients of ABC is taken, and brokerage charges are calculated with the new rates of XYZ broker. If the mean of the sample is $18.75 and the sample standard deviation is $6, can any inference be made about the difference in the average brokerage bill between ABC and XYZ broker?



H0: Null Hypothesis: mean = 18H1: Alternative Hypothesis: mean <> 18 (This is what we want to prove.)Rejection region: Z <= - Z2.5 and Z>=Z2.5 (assuming 5% significance level, split 2.5 each on either side).Z = (sample mean – mean) / (std-dev / sqrt (no. of samples)) = (18.75 – 18) / (6/(sqrt(100)) = 1.25



This calculated Z value falls between the two limits defined by: - Z2.5 = -1.96 and Z2.5 = 1.96.

This concludes that there is insufficient evidence to infer that there is any difference between the rates of your existing broker and the new broker. Therefore, the null hypothesis cannot be rejected. Alternatively, the p-value = P(Z< -1.25)+P(Z >1.25) = 2 * 0.1056 = 0.2112 = 21.12%, which is greater than 0.05 or 5%, leads to the same conclusion.




How Is a Two-Tailed Test Designed?
A two-tailed test is designed to determine whether a claim is true or not given a population parameter. It examines both sides of a specified data range as designated by the probability distribution involved. As such, the probability distribution should represent the likelihood of a specified outcome based on predetermined standards.




What Is the Difference Between a Two-Tailed and One-Tailed Test?
A two-tailed hypothesis test is designed to show whether the sample mean is significantly greater than and significantly less than the mean of a population. The two-tailed test gets its name from testing the area under both tails (sides) of a normal distribution. A one-tailed hypothesis test, on the other hand, is set up to show that the sample mean would be higher or lower than the population mean.




What Is a Z-score?
A Z-score numerically describes a value's relationship to the mean of a group of values and is measured in terms of the number of standard deviations from the mean. If a Z-score is 0, it indicates that the data point's score is identical to the mean score whereas Z-scores of 1.0 and -1.0 would indicate values one standard deviation above or below the mean. In most large data sets, 99% of values have a Z-score between -3 and 3, meaning they lie within three standard deviations above and below the mean.
What Is a Two-Way ANOVA?  

ANOVA stands for analysis of variance and tests for differences in the effects of independent variables on a dependent variable. A two-way ANOVA test is a statistical test used to determine the effect of two nominal predictor variables on a continuous outcome variable.



A two-way ANOVA tests the effect of two independent variables on a dependent variable. A two-way ANOVA test analyzes the effect of the independent variables on the expected outcome along with their relationship to the outcome itself. Random factors would be considered to have no statistical influence on a data set, while systematic factors would be considered to have statistical significance.



By using ANOVA, a researcher is able to determine whether the variability of the outcomes is due to chance or to the factors in the analysis. ANOVA has many applications in finance, economics, science, medicine, and social science.





Key Takeaways

A two-way ANOVA is an extension of the one-way ANOVA (analysis of variances) that reveals the results of two independent variables on a dependent variable.A two-way ANOVA test is a statistical technique that analyzes the effect of the independent variables on the expected outcome along with their relationship to the outcome itself.ANOVA has many applications in finance, economics, science, medicine, and social science.


   Understanding Two-Way ANOVA  

An ANOVA test is the first step in identifying factors that influence a given outcome. Once an ANOVA test is performed, a tester may be able to perform further analysis on the systematic factors that are statistically contributing to the data set's variability.



A two-way ANOVA test reveals the results of two independent variables on a dependent variable. ANOVA test results can then be used in an F-test, a statistical test used to determine whether two populations with normal distributions share variances or a standard deviation, on the significance of the regression formula overall.



Analysis of variances is helpful for testing the effects of variables on one another. It is similar to multiple two-sample t-tests. However, it results in fewer type 1 errors and is appropriate for a range of issues. An ANOVA test groups differences by comparing the means of each group and includes spreading out the variance across diverse sources. It is employed with subjects, test groups, between groups and within groups.


   One-Way ANOVA vs. Two-Way ANOVA  

There are two main types of analysis of variance: one-way (or unidirectional) and two-way (bidirectional). One-way or two-way refers to the number of independent variables in your analysis of variance test. A one-way ANOVA evaluates the impact of a sole factor on a sole response variable. It determines whether the observed differences between the means of independent (unrelated) groups are explainable by chance alone, or whether there are any statistically significant differences between groups.



A two-way ANOVA is an extension of the one-way ANOVA. With a one-way, you have one independent variable affecting a dependent variable. With a two-way ANOVA, there are two independents. For example, a two-way ANOVA allows a company to compare worker productivity based on two independent variables, such as department and gender. It is utilized to observe the interaction between the two factors. It tests the effect of two factors at the same time.



A three-way ANOVA, also known as three-factor ANOVA, is a statistical means of determining the effect of three factors on an outcome.

What Is a Type I Error?  

The term type I error is a statistical concept that refers to the incorrect rejection of an accurate null hypothesis. Put simply, a type I error is a false positive result. Making a type I error often can't be avoided because of the degree of uncertainty involved. A null hypothesis is established during hypothesis testing before a test begins. In some cases, a type I error assumes there's no cause-and-effect relationship between the tested item and the stimuli to trigger an outcome to the test.





Key Takeaways

A type I error occurs during hypothesis testing when a null hypothesis is rejected, even though it is accurate and should not be rejected.Hypothesis testing is a testing process that uses sample data. The null hypothesis assumes no cause-and-effect relationship between the tested item and the stimuli applied during the test.A type I error is a false positive leading to an incorrect rejection of the null hypothesis.A false positive can occur If something other than the stimuli causes the outcome of the test.


   How a Type I Error Works  

Hypothesis testing is a testing process that uses sample data. The test is designed to provide evidence that the hypothesis or conjecture is supported by the data being tested. A null hypothesis is a belief that there is no statistical significance or effect between the two data sets, variables, or populations being considered in the hypothesis. A researcher would generally try to disprove the null hypothesis.



For example, let's say the null hypothesis states that an investment strategy doesn't perform any better than a market index like the S&P 500. The researcher would take samples of data and test the historical performance of the investment strategy to determine if the strategy performed at a higher level than the S&P. If the test results show that the strategy performed at a higher rate than the index, the null hypothesis is rejected.



This condition is denoted as n=0. If the result seems to indicate that the stimuli applied to the test subject caused a reaction when the test is conducted, the null hypothesis stating that the stimuli do not affect the test subject then needs to be rejected.






A null hypothesis should ideally never be rejected if it's found to be true. It should always be rejected if it's found to be false. However, there are situations when errors can occur.


   False Positive Type I Error  

A type I error is also called a false positive result. This result leads to an incorrect rejection of the null hypothesis. It rejects an idea that shouldn't have been rejected in the first place. Rejecting the null hypothesis under the assumption that there is no relationship between the test subject, the stimuli, and the outcome may sometimes be incorrect. If something other than the stimuli causes the outcome of the test, it can cause a false positive result.


   Examples of Type I Errors  

Let's look at a couple of hypothetical examples to show how type I errors occur.


  Criminal Trials  

Type I errors commonly occur in criminal trials, where juries are required to come up with a verdict of either innocent or guilty. In this case, the null hypothesis is that the person is innocent, while the alternative is guilty. A jury may come up with a type I error if the members find that the person is found guilty and is sent to jail, despite actually being innocent.


  Medical Testing  

In medical testing, a type I error would cause the appearance that a treatment for a disease has the effect of reducing the severity of the disease when, in fact, it does not. When a new medicine is being tested, the null hypothesis will be that the medicine does not affect the progression of the disease. Let's say a lab is researching a new cancer drug. Their null hypothesis might be that the drug does not affect the growth rate of cancer cells.



After applying the drug to the cancer cells, the cancer cells stop growing. This would cause the researchers to reject their null hypothesis that the drug would have no effect. If the drug caused the growth stoppage, the conclusion to reject the null, in this case, would be correct. However, if something else during the test caused the growth stoppage instead of the administered drug, this would be an example of an incorrect rejection of the null hypothesis (i.e., a type I error).




How Does a Type I Error Occur?
A type I error occurs when the null hypothesis, which is the belief that there is no statistical significance or effect between the data sets considered in the hypothesis, is mistakenly rejected. The type I error should never be rejected even though it's accurate. It is also known as a false positive result.




What Is the Difference Between a Type I and Type II Error?
Type I and type II errors occur during statistical hypothesis testing. While the type I error (a false positive) rejects a null hypothesis when it is, in fact, correct, the type II error (a false negative) fails to reject a false null hypothesis. For example, a type I error would convict someone of a crime when they are actually innocent. A type II error would acquit a guilty individual when they are guilty of a crime.




What Is a Null Hypothesis?
A null hypothesis occurs in statistical hypothesis testing. It states that no relationship exists between two data sets or populations. When a null hypothesis is accurate and rejected, the result is a false positive or a type I error. When it is false and fails to be rejected, a false negative occurs. This is also referred to as a type II error.




What's the Difference Between a Type I Error and a False Positive?
A type I error is often called a false positive. This occurs when the null hypothesis is rejected even though it's correct. The rejection takes place because of the assumption that there is no relationship between the data sets and the stimuli. As such, the outcome is assumed to be incorrect.


   The Bottom Line  

Hypothesis testing is a form of testing that uses data sets to either accept or determine a specific outcome using a null hypothesis. Although we often don't realize it, we use hypothesis testing in our everyday lives. This comes in many areas, such as making investment decisions or deciding the fate of a person in a criminal trial. Sometimes, the result may be a type I error. This false positive is the incorrect rejection of the null hypothesis even when it is true.
What Is a Type II Error?  

A type II error is a statistical term used within the context of hypothesis testing that describes the error that occurs when one fails to reject a null hypothesis that is actually false. A type II error produces a false negative, also known as an error of omission. For example, a test for a disease may report a negative result when the patient is infected. This is a type II error because we accept the conclusion of the test as negative, even though it is incorrect.



A Type II error can be contrasted with a type I error is the rejection of a true null hypothesis, whereas a type II error describes the error that occurs when one fails to reject a null hypothesis that is actually false. The error rejects the alternative hypothesis, even though it does not occur due to chance.





Key Takeaways

A type II error is defined as the probability of incorrectly failing to reject the null hypothesis, when in fact it is not applicable to the entire population.A type II error is essentially a false negative.A type II error can be reduced by making more stringent criteria for rejecting a null hypothesis, although this increases the chances of a false positive.The sample size, the true population size, and the pre-set alpha level influence the magnitude of risk of an error.Analysts need to weigh the likelihood and impact of type II errors with type I errors.


   Understanding a Type II Error  

A type II error, also known as an error of the second kind or a beta error, confirms an idea that should have been rejected, such as, for instance, claiming that two observances are the same, despite them being different. A type II error does not reject the null hypothesis, even though the alternative hypothesis is the true state of nature. In other words, a false finding is accepted as true.



A type II error can be reduced by making more stringent criteria for rejecting a null hypothesis (H0). For example, if an analyst is considering anything that falls within the +/- bounds of a 95% confidence interval as statistically insignificant (a negative result), then by decreasing that tolerance to +/- 90%, and subsequently narrowing the bounds, you will get fewer negative results, and thus reduce the chances of a false negative.



Taking these steps, however, tends to increase the chances of encountering a type I error—a false-positive result. When conducting a hypothesis test, the probability or risk of making a type I error or type II error should be considered.






The steps taken to reduce the chances of encountering a type II error tend to increase the probability of a type I error.


   Type I Errors vs. Type II Errors  

The difference between a type II error and a type I error is that a type I error rejects the null hypothesis when it is true (i.e., a false positive). The probability of committing a type I error is equal to the level of significance that was set for the hypothesis test. Therefore, if the level of significance is 0.05, there is a 5% chance a type I error may occur.



The probability of committing a type II error is equal to one minus the power of the test, also known as beta. The power of the test could be increased by increasing the sample size, which decreases the risk of committing a type II error.






Some statistical literature will include overall significance level and type II error risk as part of the report's analysis. For example, a 2021 meta-analysis of exosome in the treatment of spinal cord injury recorded an overall significance level of 0.05 and a type II error risk of 0.1.


   Example of a Type II Error  

Assume a biotechnology company wants to compare how effective two of its drugs are for treating diabetes. The null hypothesis states the two medications are equally effective. A null hypothesis, H0, is the claim that the company hopes to reject using the one-tailed test. The alternative hypothesis, Ha, states the two drugs are not equally effective. The alternative hypothesis, Ha, is the state of nature that is supported by rejecting the null hypothesis.



The biotech company implements a large clinical trial of 3,000 patients with diabetes to compare the treatments. The company randomly divides the 3,000 patients into two equally sized groups, giving one group one of the treatments and the other group the other treatment. It selects a significance level of 0.05, which indicates it is willing to accept a 5% chance it may reject the null hypothesis when it is true or a 5% chance of committing a type I error.



Assume the beta is calculated to be 0.025, or 2.5%. Therefore, the probability of committing a type II error is 97.5%. If the two medications are not equal, the null hypothesis should be rejected. However, if the biotech company does not reject the null hypothesis when the drugs are not equally effective, a type II error occurs.




What Is the Difference Between Type I and Type II Errors?
A type I error occurs if a null hypothesis is rejected that is actually true in the population. This type of error is representative of a false positive. Alternatively, a type II error occurs if a null hypothesis is not rejected that is actually false in the population. This type of error is representative of a false negative.




What Causes Type II Errors?
A type II error is commonly caused if the statistical power of a test is too low. The highest the statistical power, the greater the chance of avoiding an error. It's often recommended that the statistical power should be set to at least 80% prior to conducting any testing.




What Factors Influence the Magnitude of Risk for Type II Errors?
As the sample size of the research increases, the magnitude of risk for type II errors should decrease. As the true population effect size increases, the type II error should also decrease. Last, the pre-set alpha level set by the research influences the magnitude of risk. As the alpha level set decreases, the risk of a type II error increases.




How Can a Type II Error Be Minimized?
It is not possible to fully prevent committing a Type II error; but, the risk can be minimized by increasing the sample size. However, doing so will also increase the risk of committing a Type I error instead.


   The Bottom Line  

In statistics, a Type II error results in a false negative - meaning that there is a finding but it has been missed in the analysis (or that the null hypothesis is not rejected when it ought to have been). A Type II error can occur if there is not enough power in statistical tests, often resulting from sample sizes that are too small. Increasing the sample size can help reduce the chances of committing a Type II error. Type II errors can be contrasted with Type I errors, which are false positives.
What Is tZero (t0)?  

tZero (t0) is a distributed ledger platform and cryptocurrency launched by the Internet retail company Overstock. It was developed to give greater legitimacy and oversight to initial coin offerings (ICOs) and to allow companies to create and issue tokenized assets for investors.



Unlike other decentralized blockchain platforms, tZero has been designated an alternative trading system (ATS) and is regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and FINRA.





Key Takeaways

tZero (t0) is a blockchain-based asset exchange launched by Internet retailer Overstock, seeking to address the problem of regulatory compliance of ICOs.tZero allows companies to register and issue tokenized assets onto a distributed ledger known as a blockchain—the same technology that underlies Bitcoin.tZero itself was funded with help from an ICO.


   tZero History  

The creation of cryptocurrencies, trading platforms, and blockchain technologies has reached a fever pitch in years since Bitcoin’s launch in 2009. Cryptocurrencies have brought together technology enthusiasts, libertarians, speculators, and investors, with the pace of innovation far outstripping the speed at which regulators can adopt rules to ensure that consumers are protected.



New financial products called initial coin offerings, (ICOs), and new ways of managing investments with digital wallets have been utilized. These advancements are changing the way that people look at money.



In some cases, companies look to not only provide a cryptocurrency token, but also a platform that uses blockchain technology to handle transactions. tZero is such a company, offering both an alternative trading system (ATS) as well as tokens.



The platform is designed to allow buyers and sellers to trade through a dark pool, meaning that it acts as a matchmaker rather than a broker. Transactions are managed through a distributed ledger. tZero seeks to become the leading platform through which companies offer ICOs.


   Launched By Overstock  

tZero grew out of an earlier effort by Overstock.com, an online retailer, to develop a blockchain technology called Medici. Medici was designed to allow Overstock, as well as other businesses that license the technology, to be able to sell cryptocurrencies. This effort began in 2014. As of 2021, the venture capital firm Pelion Venture Partners manages Medici Ventures on behalf of Overstock.



Patrick Byrne, the founder of Overstock, is listed as one of tZero’s principals in its 2018 Notice of Exempt Offering of Securities (Form D) filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).



The company began selling Simple Agreements for Future Equity (SAFEs), a convertible financial instrument, to accredited investors in December 2017. SAFEs allow companies to raise capital outside of traditional debt and equity markets and provide investors with some features of convertible notes. It is most commonly used by cryptocurrency companies. According to its initial filing with the SEC, tZero expected to raise $250 million.


   Regulated by SEC  

For regulators, tZero represents one of the earliest attempts at managing cryptocurrencies and alternative trading systems. It wasn’t until 2017—eight years after the launch of Bitcoin—that the SEC issued a ruling on tokens. Regulatory uncertainty left crypto holders much less protected than securities investors, which has likely contributed both to price volatility and to the well-publicized hacks of various exchanges. Overstock.com shares rose more than 20% the day after FINRA approved tZERO's membership application in 2020.



Being regulated puts tZero at a substantial advantage when it comes to financial products based on cryptocurrencies, as it can provide services that other platforms may not be able to provide. Because it is required to comply with regulations, tZero can position itself as a provider of advice, clearing, and verification services to other companies looking to release tokens to raise funds.



While companies looking to raise funds through the sale of tokens could build their own platforms, and thus cut out the middleman, this would require substantial investment and expertise. Using a company like tZero may wind up being more cost-effective, and may result in tZero one day being considered akin to Nasdaq.
