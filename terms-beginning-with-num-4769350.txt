What Is the 0x Protocol?  

The 0x (zero x) protocol is a protocol that enables the peer-to-peer exchange of assets on the Ethereum blockchain. The 0x protocol was launched in 2017 by 0x Labs, an organization based in San Francisco focused on creating new markets in the 0x ecosystem.



The protocol itself is not, by definition, a decentralized exchange; it allows for the creation of decentralized exchanges that can be used in broad applications.





Key Takeaways

The 0x protocol is an open protocol that enables the peer-to-peer exchange of assets on the Ethereum blockchain.0x Labs, an organization focused on creating new markets in the 0x ecosystem, built the 0x protocol.Built on the foundation of Ethereum token standards, 0x protocol acts as the critical infrastructure layer for the growing number of financial applications implementing the blockchain technology stack.


   Understanding the 0x Protocol  

In the world of digital currencies, a protocol is a set of standard rules that can be used by a system (or by various transacting parties) to communicate with each other smoothly. The 0x protocol is essentially a standard messaging format that transacting entities can use to exchange digital assets or tokens.



The standard SWIFT messaging system used in the banking industry is similar to a protocol (except that it is used in a different context). Banks across the globe use the standard SWIFT messaging system to communicate about money transfers.



The system has a standard set of message fields defined for all users; their corresponding values are used in the SWIFT system to securely convey details between two parties, such as sender, recipient, amount, currency, source branch, and destination branch, among others.






SWIFT creates a standard and universally acceptable format which allows for smoother operations and higher efficiency.



Because each bank has adapted to the standard rules of the SWIFT messaging system, they can transact with each other directly. The situation would go awry if each bank followed its own distinct protocol because then they would have to adhere to a one-on-one communication channel with every other bank.


   Goals of 0x  

The goal of 0x Labs is to make the necessary infrastructure for the emerging cryptocurrency economy and enable markets to be created that couldn’t have existed before.



The 0x protocol attempts to work similarly to SWIFT, but in the context of operating decentralized exchanges for trading digital tokens and assets that run on the Ethereum blockchain. Built on the foundation of Ethereum token standards, 0x protocol acts as the key infrastructure layer for the burgeoning number of financial applications and instruments being created using blockchain technology and trading in digital forms.



With every passing day, tokens are becoming an increasing part of the world’s financial value. Consequently, the requirement to trade digital assets and tokens securely and efficiently is growing. With its clearly defined message formats and smart contracts, the 0x protocol attempts to answer this need.






The word "token" is often used interchangeably with "coin." However, a token is different from a coin because it represents an asset, whereas a coin is used as a means of exchange.



It is used in a wide array of markets, such as gaming and financing, that enables users to trade tokens and assets.



ZRX is 0x’s native governance and staking token. ZRX owners have a say in how the protocol evolves, and token holders can also stake their tokens to earn ETH (the Ethereum token ether) liquidity rewards.


   Special Considerations  

The 0x protocol’s message format is composed of a set of data fields that carry vital information, such as the digital asset or token to be traded, the price value of the transaction, the expiration time, and the defined identities of the transacting parties.



Smart contracts take care of the necessary business logic for generating, sending, receiving, and processing the data linked to the trading activity. It also allows room for essential upgrades, if any, in the future. The provisions for upgrades are required if any changes are necessary for adhering to the modified regulations or any modifications linked to the intrinsic working of the Ethereum blockchain network.



The system also uses relayers, which act as order aggregators and broadcast orders from designated market participants to the marketplace or exchange.




Can I Mine 0x?
0x is a protocol for the Ethereum blockchain. It facilitates peer-to-peer exchanges of assets built using Ethereum, so there is no token to mine.




What Is Zerox Coin?
Created by the company 0x (zero x), ZRX is a token built on the Ethereum blockchain to fuel cryptocurrency exchanges.




Is 0x a DEX?
It is similar to a decentralized exchange but has unique differences. One of the differences is that a DEX stores orders on its blockchain, while 0x does not.

What Is 1%/10 Net 30?  

The 1%/10 net 30 calculation is a way of providing cash discounts on purchases. It means that if the bill is paid within 10 days, there is a 1% discount. Otherwise, the total amount is due within 30 days.





Key Takeaways

A 1%/10 net 30 deal is when a 1% discount is offered for services or products as long as they are paid within 10 days of a 30-day payment agreement. The cost of credit is used as a percentage and occurs when the buyer does not take the reduced cost, thus paying the higher cost, reflecting the discount loss. A vendor may offer incentives to pay early to accelerate the inflow of cash, which is especially important for businesses with no revolving lines of credit.


   Understanding 1%/10 Net 30  

The 1%/10 net 30 calculation represents the credit terms and payment requirements outlined by a seller. The vendor may offer incentives to pay early to accelerate the inflow of cash. This is particularly important for cash-strapped businesses or companies with no revolving lines of credit. Companies with higher profit margins are more likely to offer cash discounts.



Although the numbers are always interchangeable across vendors, the standard structure for offering a payment discount is the same. The first number will always be the percentage discount. This figure will indicate the total percentage discount on the invoice prior to shipping or taxes that may be discounted upon early payment.


   Special Considerations  

Discount terms like 1%/10 net 30 are virtual short-term loans. This is because if the discount is not taken, the buyer must pay the higher price as opposed to paying a reduced cost. In effect, the difference between these two prices reflects the discount lost, which can be reported as a percentage. This percentage is called the cost of credit.



When the credit terms are 1%/10 net 30, the net result becomes, in essence, an interest charge of 18.2% upon the failure to take the discount.






Companies with higher profit margins are more likely to offer cash discounts.



The accounting entry for a cash discount taken may be performed in two ways. The gross method of purchase discounts assumes the discount will not be taken and will only input the discount upon actual receipt of payment within the discount period.



Therefore, the entire amount of receivable will be debited. When payment is received, the receivable will be credited in the amount of the payment and the difference will be a credit to discounts taken. The alternative method is called the net method. For a discount of 1%/10 net 30, it is assumed the 1% discount will be taken. This results in a receivable being debited for 99% of the total cost.


   Example of 1%/10 Net 30  

For example, if "$1000 - 1%/10 net 30" is written on a bill, the buyer can take a 1% discount ($1000 x 0.01 = $10) and make a payment of $990 within 10 days, or pay the entire $1000 within 30 days.






If the invoice is not paid within the discount period, no price reduction occurs, and the invoice must be paid within the stipulated number of days before late fees may be assessed.



The second number is always the number of days of the discount period. In the example above, the discount period is 10 days. Finally, the third number always reflects the invoice due date.
What Is a 10-K?  

A 10-K is a comprehensive report filed annually by a publicly-traded company about its financial performance and is required by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The report contains much more detail than a company's annual report, which is sent to its shareholders before an annual meeting to elect company directors.



Some of the information a company is required to document in the 10-K includes its history, organizational structure, financial statements, earnings per share, subsidiaries, executive compensation, and any other relevant data.



The SEC requires this report to keep investors aware of a company's financial condition and to allow them to have enough information before they buy or sell shares in the corporation, or before investing in the firm’s corporate bonds.





Key Takeaways

A 10-K is a comprehensive report filed annually by public companies about their financial performance.The report is required by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and is far more detailed than the annual report. Information in the 10-K includes corporate history, financial statements, earnings per share, and any other relevant data. The 10-K is a useful tool for investors to make important decisions about their investments.

   Understanding 10-Ks  

Because of the depth and nature of the information they contain, 10-Ks are fairly long and tend to be complicated. But investors need to understand that this is one of the most comprehensive and most important documents a public company can publish on a yearly basis. The more information they can gather from the 10-K, the more they can understand the company.



The government requires companies to publish 10-K forms so investors have fundamental information about companies so they can make informed investment decisions. This form gives a clearer picture of everything a company does and what kinds of risks it faces.






Investors in the know are aware that 10-Ks can also be retrieved by using the company search function through the SEC's EDGAR database.



The 10-K includes five distinct sections:



Business. This provides an overview of the company’s main operations, including its products and services (i.e., how it makes money).
Risk factors. These outline any and all risks the company faces or may face in the future. The risks are typically listed in order of importance.
Selected financial data. This section details specific financial information about the company over the last five years. This section presents more of a near-term view of the company’s recent performance.
Management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations. Also known as MD&A, this gives the company an opportunity to explain its business results from the previous fiscal year. This section is where the company can tell its story in its own words.
Financial statements and supplementary data. This includes the company’s audited financial statements including the income statement, balance sheets, and statement of cash flows. A letter from the company’s independent auditor certifying the scope of their review is also included in this section.



A 10-K filing also includes signed letters from the company’s chief executive officer and chief financial officer. In it, the executives swear under oath that the information included in the 10-K is accurate. These letters became a requirement after several high-profile cases involving accounting fraud following the dot-com bust.






   Where to Find a 10-K  

Notably, 10-K filings are public information and readily available through a number of sources. In fact, the vast majority of companies include them in the Investor Relations section of their website. The information included in a 10-K can be difficult to move through, but the more familiar investors become with the layout and the type of information included, it will likely become easier to identify the most important details.


   10-K Filing Deadlines  

Filing deadlines for the 10-K vary based on the size of the company. According to the SEC, companies with a public float—shares issued to the public that are available to trade—of $700 million or more must file their 10-K within 60 days after the end of their fiscal year. Companies with a float between $75 million and $700 million have 75 days, while companies with less than $75 million in their float have 90 days.


   Forms 10-Q and 8-K  

Along with the 10-K, the SEC requires that public companies regularly file forms 10-Q and 8-K.



Form 10-Q must be submitted to the SEC on a quarterly basis. This form is a comprehensive report of a company's performance and includes relevant information about its financial position. Unlike the 10-K, the information in the 10-Q is usually unaudited. The company is only required to file it three times a year as the 10-K is filed in the fourth quarter.



The form 8-K though is required by the SEC whenever companies announce major events of which shareholders must be made aware. These events may include (but aren't limited to) sales, acquisitions, delistings, departures, and elections of executives, as well as changes in a company's status or control, bankruptcies, information about operations, assets, and any other relevant news.
What Is a 10-K Wrap?  

A 10-K wrap is a summary report of a company's annual performance that bundles the 10-K report required by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) with additional commentary from the company, covering such things as the corporate vision, letter to shareholders, and business overview, among other topics.



The 10-K wrap is often released instead of a traditional annual report and generally contains fewer images and comments from management.





Key Takeaways

A 10-K wrap is part of a larger annual performance document required by the SEC.The "wrap" is a short commentary covering the more personal side of the business, and usually includes a letter to the shareholders and a corporate vision statement.The 10-K wrap report is shorter than a company's annual report.While a 10-K wrap (typically) has a lower-value production budget with limited graphics, its cover may be extremely polished by comparison.The basic sections of a 10-K wrap summarize the company's financial status, plus an overview of the company's financial plans for upcoming quarters.Usually, a 10-K wrap provides debt and spending level forecasts, as well.


   Understanding a 10-K Wrap  

Form 10-K is a detailed annual report that is required to be submitted to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The filing provides a comprehensive summary of a company’s performance for the year. It is more detailed than the annual report that is sent to shareholders during the annual meeting to elect directors. SEC filing 10-K outlines the company’s history, equity, subsidiaries, organizational structure, audited financial statements, and other relevant information.



The most significant difference between the traditional annual report and the 10-K wrap is how the information is presented and how much additional information is included above the required 10-K information.



The traditional annual report has a greater focus on comments from the company, and the document includes more images and graphs to communicate performance, as well as a list of corporate objectives of the company.



By contrast, the 10-K wrap is essentially the 10-K filed with the SEC and some additional editorial from the company—but not nearly as much as the annual report. It usually has a lower production cost because it is often printed on lower-quality paper.






 The 10-K wrap is typically made available in print and digital formats to maximize access for shareholders, investors, and analysts.


   Elements of a 10-K Wrap  

The basic elements of a 10-K wrap typically include a summary of the company's financial results for the previous year and an overview of its plans for upcoming quarters, including spending and debt level forecasts.



A 10-K plan can also include an elaborate cover design, with perhaps a theme that focuses on investors and analysts involved in the company's projects for the upcoming year.



Graphics in the 10-K wrap will usually provide a brief overview of the company's financials, including revenue, net profit, costs, income, and any highlights from the previous year. The graphics may also outline the company's geographical reach or other elements of growth.





2022 10-K Filing Deadlines

10-K: Due Monday, April 18, 2022, for the fiscal year ended on Jan. 31, 2022.10-Q: Due Tuesday, May 10, 2022, for the quarterly period ended on March 31, 2022.


   Special Considerations  

As the 10-K wrap has evolved, it has come to include more images and content, such as a shareholder letter and high-quality photographs. However, pictures will often be kept to a minimum.



The 10-K wrap document is usually no more than four pages long and could be even shorter, depending on what company executives want to see from the 10-K wrap report.
What Is SEC Form 10-Q?  

SEC Form 10-Q is a comprehensive report of financial performance that must be submitted quarterly by all public companies to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). In the 10-Q, firms are required to disclose relevant information regarding their finances as a result of their business operations. The 10-Q is generally an unaudited report.



A 10-Q must be filed for each of the first three quarters of the company's fiscal year.





Key Takeaways

SEC Form 10-Q is a comprehensive report of financial performance submitted quarterly by all public companies to the Securities and Exchange Commission.Form 10-Q contains financial statements, management discussion and analysis, disclosures, and internal controls for the previous quarter.Companies must file their 10-Qs 40 or 45 days after the end of their quarters, depending on the size of their public float.A snapshot of the company's financial position, Form 10-Q provides investors with information they can compare to previous periods and use to evaluate the outlook for the stock's performance.Form 10-Q is not an audited statement, unlike the annual Form 10-K companies are also required to file.


   Understanding SEC Form 10-Q  

Federal securities laws mandate that publicly traded companies provide certain information to shareholders and the general public. These disclosures may occur periodically or as specific events occur. A company utilizes Form 10-Q—one of many required by the SEC—upon the completion of each quarter to release unaudited financial statements and give an overview of the company’s financial situation.



The exact filing dates depend on the organization’s fiscal year, but it is necessary to file three 10-Q reports each year. A 10-Q for the final quarter of the year is not required: After the fourth quarter, a company files Form 10-K, an annual report, instead. This report, unlike the 10-Q, is audited and tends to contain more details.






A company's form 10-Q is public information. Anyone who wishes to examine a company's quarterly report can go to the SEC's EDGAR database. You can search by company name, ticker symbol, or SEC Central Index Key (CIK). Many companies also post their 10-Qs on their websites, in an "Investor Relations" section.


   SEC Form 10-Q Filing Deadlines  

The deadline for filing a 10-Q varies and depends on the number of outstanding shares a company has. A company filing a 10-Q is classified in one of three categories. Its category is determined by its public float—that is, the portion of outstanding stock that is in the hands of the public, and not held by officers, owners, or the government. Essentially, the float is comprised of all of a company’s freely traded common stock shares.



The largest companies are classified as large accelerated filers. To meet this requirement, the organization must have at least $700 million in public float. If the company meets this requirement, it has 40 days after the close of the quarter to file its 10-Q.



Accelerated filers are companies with at least $75 million in public float but less than $700 million. Accelerated filers also have 40 days to file the 10-Q (they have a little more time to file the 10-K).



Finally, non-accelerated filers are companies with less than $75 million of public float. These companies have 45 days from the end of the quarter to file the 10-Q.

   Failure to Meet Form 10-Q Filing Deadline  

When a company fails to file a 10-Q by the filing deadline, it must use a non-timely (NT) filing. An NT filing must explain why the deadline has not been achieved, and it gives the company an additional five days to file. Companies are required to submit an NT 10-Q to request the extension and explain the delay.



As long as a company has a reasonable explanation, the SEC allows late filings within a specified time period. Common reasons why companies are not able to file on time include mergers and acquisitions (M&A), corporate litigation, an ongoing review by corporate auditors, or lingering effects from a bankruptcy.



A 10-Q filing is considered timely if it is filed within this extension. Failure to comply with this extended deadline results in consequences, including the potential loss of the SEC registration, removal from stock exchanges, and legal ramifications.


   Components of SEC Form 10-Q  

There are two parts to a 10-Q filing. The first part contains relevant financial information covering the period. This includes condensed financial statements, management discussion, and analysis on the financial condition of the entity, disclosures regarding market risk, and internal controls.



The second part contains all other pertinent information. This includes legal proceedings, unregistered sales of equity securities, the use of proceeds from the sale of unregistered sales of equity, and defaults upon senior securities. The company discloses any other information—including the use of exhibits—in this section.


   Importance of SEC Form 10-Q  

The 10-Q provides a window into the financial health of the company. Investors can use the form to get a sense of its quarterly earnings and other elements of its operations, and to compare them to previous quarters—thus tracking its performance.






Form 10-Q, and the requirement for filing it, was established by the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934. The aim was to promote transparency in public companies' operations, by providing investors with the financial position of companies on an ongoing basis.



Some areas of interest to investors that are commonly visible in the 10-Q include changes to working capital and/or accounts receivables, factors affecting a company's inventory, share buybacks, and even any legal risks that a company faces.



You can use a close competitor's 10-Q to compare that to a company in which you are invested, or considering to invest in, to see how it's performing. This will give you an idea of whether it's a strong choice, where its weaknesses are, and how it could stand to improve.


   Other Important SEC Filings  

The 10-Q is one of many reports public companies are required to file with the SEC. Other important and mandated filings include:



Form 10-K: The 10-K must be filed once per year and includes the final quarter of the company's performance (replacing a fourth-quarter 10-Q). This report serves as a summary of the year, often containing more detailed information than an annual report, and must be filed within 90 days of the end of a company's fiscal year. The 10-K generally includes a summary of the company's operations, management's financial outlook, financial statements, and any legal or administrative issues involving the company.



Form 8-K: This report is filed if there are any changes or developments to a business that didn't make the 10-Q or 10-K reports. This is considered an unscheduled document and may contain information such as press releases. If a company disposes of or acquires assets, has announcements of executive hiring or departures, or goes into receivership, this information is filed with an 8-K.



Annual report: A company's annual report is filed every year, and contains a wealth of company news including—but not limited to—general information about the company, a letter to shareholders from the CEO, financial statements, and an auditors report. This report is submitted a few months after the end of a company's fiscal year. The report is available through a company's website or investor relations team, and can also be obtained from the SEC.


   Form 10-Q FAQs  
  What Is a 10-Q Filing?  

A 10-Q filing is a report that all public companies must submit to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) after the end of each of their first three fiscal quarters (hence the "Q"). The filing is submitted by filling out a Form 10-Q.


  What Is the Difference Between a 10-K and a 10-Q?  

The main difference between Forms 10-K and 10-Q lies in the frequency and the amount of info they contain. Form 10-K is an annual report, filed at the end of a company's fiscal year. Filed just once, it summarizes all the data for the year, including the fourth quarter. In contrast, Form 10-Q is filed three times a year, at the end of a company's fiscal quarter. It details financial info for that quarter.



Also, Form 10-K is an audited report. Form 10-Q generally is not.


  Are Public Companies Required to File Form 10-Q?  

Yes, all U. S. public companies issuing common shares of stock that trade on exchanges are required to file Form 10-Q. The date by which they have to file varies on the number of shares, expressed in terms of dollar worth, they have outstanding.


  Must Review Reports Accompany Financial Statements in a 10-Q?  

10-Qs generally are not audited or accompanied by accountants' reports. SEC regulations prohibit companies from making materially false or misleading statements, or omitting material information to make disclosures not misleading. The SEC staff reviews 10-Qs and may provide comments to a company where disclosures appear to be inconsistent with the disclosure requirements or deficient in explanation or clarity.
What Is a 10-Year Treasury Note?  

The 10-year Treasury note is a debt obligation issued by the United States government with a maturity of 10 years upon initial issuance. A 10-year Treasury note pays interest at a fixed rate once every six months and pays the face value to the holder at maturity. The U.S. government partially funds itself by issuing 10-year Treasury notes.


   Understanding 10-Year Treasury Notes  

The U.S. government issues three different types of debt securities to fund its obligations: Treasury bills, Treasury notes, and Treasury bonds. Bills, bonds, and notes are distinguished by their length of maturity.



Treasury bills (T-bills) have the shortest maturities, with durations only up to a year. The Treasury offers T-bills with maturities of four, eight, 13, 26, and 52 weeks. Treasury notes have maturities ranging from a year to 10 years, while bonds are Treasury securities with maturities longer than 10 years.



Treasury notes and bonds pay interest at a fixed rate every six months to maturity, and are then redeemed at par value, meaning the Treasury repays the principal it borrowed.



In contrast, T-bills are issued at discounts to par and pay no coupon payments. The interest earned on T-bills is the difference between the face value repaid at maturity and the purchase price paid.






   The 10-Year Note Yield as a Benchmark  

The 10-year T-note is the most widely tracked government debt instrument in finance. Its yield is often used as a benchmark for other interest rates, like those on mortgages and corporate debt, though commercial interest rates do not track the 10-year yield exactly.



Below is a chart of the 10-year Treasury yield from March 2019 to March 2020. Over that span, the yield steadily declined with expectations that the Federal Reserve would maintain low interest rates or cut them further. In late February 2020, the decline in yield accelerated amid growing concerns about the economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. As the Fed ordered an emergency rate cut of 50 basis points in early March, the decline of the 10-year yield accelerated even further, with the yield dropping to 0.32%, a record low, before rebounding.

   The Advantages of Investing in Treasury Notes  

Fixed-income securities offer important portfolio diversification benefits, because their returns are not correlated with the performance of stocks.



Government debt and the 10-year Treasury note in particular is considered a relatively safe investment, so its price often (but not always) moves inversely to the trend of the major stock-market indices. In a recession, central banks tend to lower interest rates, which lowers the coupon rate on new Treasuries and, subsequently, makes older Treasury securities with higher coupon rates more desirable.



Another advantage of investing in 10-year Treasury notes and other federal government securities is that the coupon payments are exempt from state and local income taxes. However, they are still taxable at the federal level. The U.S. Treasury sells 10-year notes and those with shorter maturities, as well as T-bills and bonds, directly through the TreasuryDirect website via competitive or noncompetitive bidding, with a minimum purchase of $100 and in $100 increments. Treasury securities can also be purchased through a bank or broker.



Investors can choose to hold Treasury notes until maturity or sell them early in the secondary market. There is no minimum holding term. Although the Treasury issues new T-notes of shorter maturities every month, new 10-year notes are issued only in February, May, August, and November. In other months, the Treasury sells additional 10-year notes from the most recent issue in what is known as a re-opening. Re-opened notes have the same maturity date and coupon interest rate as the original issue, but a different issue date and a purchase price reflecting subsequent change in market interest rates.



All T-notes are issued electronically, meaning investors cannot obtain paper certificates. Series I Savings Bonds are the only Treasury securities currently issued in paper form, and they can only be bought in paper form with the proceeds of a tax refund.
What Is a 100% Equities Strategy?  

A 100% equities strategy is a strategy commonly adopted by pooled funds, such as a mutual fund, that allocates all investable cash solely to stocks. Only equity securities are considered for investment, whether they be listed stocks, over-the-counter stocks, or private equity shares.





Key Takeaways

A 100% equities strategy involves only long positions in stocks.Such a strategy is common among mutual funds that allocate all investable cash solely to stocks, forgoing higher-risk instruments such as derivatives or riskier strategies such as short selling.With 100% equity strategies, a portfolio's style can be further subdivided into capital appreciation, aggressive growth, growth, value, capitalization, and income, among others.


   Understanding a 100% Equities Strategy  

100% equities strategies represent portfolios that only select investments from the equities (i.e., stocks) universe. 100% equity strategies are predominant in the market and encompass a large majority of offerings.






Generally, very few funds would be able to deploy all available capital to equity market investments without holding some cash and cash equivalents for transactions and operating activities.



In practice, many 100% equity strategies will have an investment objective or mandate to invest at least 80% in equities. The 80% threshold is a formality used in regulatory or registration documentation for the majority of equity funds in the marketplace, with many funds deploying anywhere from 90% to 100% to equities.



100% equity means that there will be no bonds or other asset classes. Furthermore, it implies that the portfolio would not make use of related products like equity derivatives, or employ riskier strategies such as short selling or buying on margin. Instead, 100% equities implies a more focused, traditional approach to equity investment.


   Special Considerations  

Equities are generally considered a riskier asset class over alternatives such as bonds, money market funds, and cash.



A well-diversified portfolio of all stocks can protect against individual company risk, or even sector risk, but market risks will still persist that can affect the equities asset class. Thus, both systemic and idiosyncratic risks are important considerations for aggressive equity investors. As a result, most financial advice recommends a portfolio that includes both equity and fixed-income (bond) components.


   100% Equities Strategy Types  

In the 100% equity strategy category, an investor will find a wide range of sub-classes to choose from, including those that focus on one (or a combination of) labels like capital appreciation, aggressive growth, growth, value, and income. Outlined below are some of the characteristics investors can expect from some of the most prominent 100% equity strategies.


  Growth  

Growth investing is a style used by many aggressive equity investors who are comfortable with higher-risk investments and seek to take advantage of growing companies. The Russell 3000 Growth Index is a broad market index that helps to represent the growth category.



Growth companies offer emerging technologies, new innovations, or a significant sector advantage that gives them above average expectations for revenue and earnings growth.


  Value  

Value stocks are often known as long term core holdings for an investor’s portfolio. These equity funds will rely on fundamental analysis to identify stocks that are undervalued in comparison to their fundamental value.



Investment metrics for value investing often include price-to-earnings, price-to-book, and free cash flow.


  Income  

Income investing is also a top category for core long-term holdings in a portfolio. Income funds will invest in equities with a focus on current income. Income from equity investments is primarily focused on mature companies paying steady dividend rates.



In the income category, real estate investment trusts and master limited partnerships are two publicly traded stock categories with unique incorporation structures that require them to pay high levels of income to equity investors.


  Market Capitalization  

Capitalization is a popular investing strategy for all equity portfolios. Generally, capitalization is broken down by large cap, mid cap, and small cap.



Large-cap companies can offer the lowest volatility as they have established businesses and steady earnings that pay dividends. Small-cap companies, on the other hand, are usually considered to have the highest risk since they are typically in the early stages of their development.
What Is Form 1040: U.S. Individual Tax Return?  

Form 1040 is the standard Internal Revenue Service (IRS) form that individual taxpayers use to file their annual income tax returns. The form contains sections that require taxpayers to disclose their taxable income for the year to determine whether additional taxes are owed or whether the filer will receive a tax refund.





Key Takeaways

Form 1040 is what individual taxpayers use to file their taxes with the IRS.The form determines if additional taxes are due or if the filer will receive a tax refund.Taxpayers must include personal information on Form 1040, such as name, address, Social Security number, and the number of dependents.A filer also needs to report wages, salary, taxable interest, capital gains, pensions, Social Security benefits, and other types of income.Taxpayers may need to file supplemental tax 1040 forms depending on their situation.


   Understanding Form 1040  

Form 1040 needs to be filed with the IRS by April 15 in most years. Everyone who earns income over a certain threshold must file an income tax return with the IRS. Keep in mind that businesses have different forms to report their profits.



Form 1040 is available on the IRS website and has two pages that must be filled out. Form 1040 can be mailed in or e-filed. Tax filers are asked for their filing status along with their personal information, such as their name, address, Social Security number (some information on one's spouse may also be needed), and the number of dependents. The form also asks about full-year health coverage and whether the taxpayer wishes to contribute $3 to presidential campaign funds.















Form 1040 (Page 1).



The 1040 income section asks the filer to report wages, salary, taxable interest, capital gains, pensions, Social Security benefits, and other types of income. The new tax legislation eliminated many deductions, including for unreimbursed employee expenses, tax-preparation fees, and moving for a job (except for military on active duty).















Form 1040 (Page 2).



The form uses what the IRS terms a building block approach and allows taxpayers to add only the schedules they need to their tax returns. Some individuals may need to file one or more of six new supplemental schedules with their 1040 in addition to long-standing schedules for items like business income or loss. This depends on whether they're claiming tax credits or owe additional taxes. Many individual taxpayers, however, only need to file a 1040 and no schedules.


   Types of Form 1040  

Taxpayers in certain situations may need to file a different variant of the 1040 form instead of the standard version. Below are the options.


  Form 1040-NR  

A number of nonresident aliens or their representatives need to file this form, including:



Those who are engaged in trade or business in the United States
Representatives of a deceased person who would have had to file a Form 1040-NR
Those who represent an estate or trust that had to file a 1040-NR






Form 1040-NR replaced Form 1040NR-EZ.



The IRS also produces the 1040-SS and 1040-PR. The 1040-SS is for residents of American Samoa, the CNMI, Guam, Puerto Rico, or the U.S. Virgin Islands who have net self-employment income and do not have to file Form 1040 with the U.S. Form 1040-PR is the Spanish-language equivalent of Form 1040-SS.


  Form 1040-ES  

This form is used to determine and pay estimated quarterly taxes. The estimated tax applies to income that isn’t subject to withholding, which includes earnings from self-employment, interest, dividends, and rents. This may also include unemployment compensation, pension income, and the taxable portion of Social Security benefits.


  Form 1040-V  

This is a statement accompanying a taxpayer's payment for any balance on the "Amount you owe" line of the 1040 or 1040-NR.


  Form 1040-X  

If a filer makes a mistake or forgets to include information on any 1040 form, Form 1040-X is used for making changes to previously filed 1040s.


  Form 1040-SR  

The IRS introduced a new 1040 form for seniors in 2019, Form 1040-SR. Changes include a larger font, no shading (shaded sections can be hard to read), and a standard deduction chart that includes the extra standard deduction for seniors. Seniors who fill out their taxes online won't notice the difference, but those who do it on paper should benefit.


   Standard Deductions on Form 1040  

The 1040 income section asks taxpayers for their filing status. This filing determines the taxpayer's standard deduction. The table below highlights the deductions for the 2022 and 2023 tax years. Keep in mind that you file 2022 taxes in 2023 and 2023 taxes in 2024.

Sources: IRS Provides Tax Inflation Adjustments for Tax Year 2022 (IRS) and IRS Provides Tax Inflation Adjustments For Tax Year 2023 (IRS)



An additional deduction may be taken by those who are age 65 or older or blind. Just like the standard deduction, these figures are adjusted annually for inflation.



Single and not widowed: $1,750 (for 2022) and $1850 (for 2023)Married filing jointly: $1,400 (2022) and $1,500 (2023) for each spouse who is 65 or older or blind






The standard deduction cannot be taken by an estate or trust, an individual who is filing a short return due to a change in accounting periods, an individual who was a nonresident alien part of the tax year, or a married individual whose spouse is filing separately and itemizing.


   Additional Schedules  

As noted above, Form 1040 uses a variety of additional schedules to help taxpayers report their tax obligations. The following schedules are used to compile financial information away from Form 1040 to later use Form 1040 as the primary source of reporting.


  Schedule 1  

Schedule 1 is used to report additional income or adjustments to income. This may include alimony, disposition proceeds from the sale of a business, educator expenses, health savings account (HSA) contributions, or unemployment compensation.



It's important to note that:



Other Income from Schedule 1: This is reported on Line 8 of Form 1040Adjustments to Income from Schedule 1: This is reported on Line 10 of Form 1040


  Schedule 2  

Schedule 2 is used to report additional taxes. One part of Schedule 2 reports alternative minimum tax and repayment of excess premium tax credits for insurance bought through health insurance marketplaces.



Another part of Schedule 2 is used to report self-employment taxes, Medicare taxes, taxes on individual retirement accounts (IRAs), household employment taxes, and other taxes. These two parts from Schedule 2 are reported on Line 17 and line 23 on Form 1040.


  Schedule 3  

Schedule 3 is used to report additional tax credits and payments. These credits include dependent care expense credits, residential energy credits, excess social security taxes previously remit, and excess Federal income taxes previously remit.



Nonrefundable credits from Schedule 3 are reported on Line 20 of Form 1040, while refundable credits from Schedule 3 are reported on Line 31 of Form 1040.


  Schedule A (Itemized Deductions)  

Schedule A is used to figure out a taxpayer's itemized deduction. A taxpayer's federal income liability is most often minimized when choosing the larger of their standard deduction or itemized deduction.



The itemized deduction calculation includes medical expenses, dental expenses, certain taxes, certain interest assessments, theft losses, and other expenses. Any input from Schedule A is entered into Line 12a on Form 1040.


  Schedule B (Interest and Ordinary Dividends  

Schedule B is used for taxpayers who received greater than $1,500 of taxable interest or ordinary dividends. It is also used to report interest from a seller-financed mortgage, accrued interest from a bond, interest or ordinary dividends as a nominee, and other similar types of interest. Input from Schedule B is entered into Line 2b and Line 3b on Form 1040.


  Schedule C (Net Profit From Business)  

Schedule C is used to report business income or loss. An activity qualifies as a business if the taxpayer is engaged in the activity for the primary purpose of producing income or profit. The activity is also considered a business as long as the taxpayer is involved in the activity with regularity and continuity. Profit from Schedule C is entered on Schedule 1, Line 3. It is also used on Schedule SE.






If your business was a sole proprietorship or qualified join venture and you meet other criteria, you can report your business operations using Schedule C-EZ, a simplified schedule compared to Schedule C.


  Schedule D (Capital Gains and Losses)  

Schedule D is used to report taxable income from the sale or exchange of a capital asset. This gain may have arisen from an exchange or an involuntary conversion. Schedule D is also used to report capital gain distributions not otherwise reported on Form 1040 as well as nonbusiness bad debts. Input from Schedule D is entered on Form 1040, Line 7.


  Schedule E (Supplemental Income and Loss)  

Schedule E is used to report various types of additional income or losses. This supplemental financial activity ranges from real estate rental income, royalties, partnerships, estates, trusts, and residual interests in real estate mortgage investment conduits. Supplemental income figures from Schedule E are reported on Form 1040 on Line 5.


  Schedule EIC (Earned Income Credit)  

Schedule EIC is quite different from other tax schedules. The earned income credit is calculated separately from this schedule. However, Schedule EIC is used to substantiate the qualification of your qualifying children by remitting to the IRS your child's name, Social Security number, birth year, relationship to you, and residency status. Information from Schedule EIC is not directly input into Form 1040.






The Earned Income Credit is maximized if a taxpayer has at least three children. Therefore, Schedule EIC only asks for information on three children; additional forms for additional children beyond three is not required.


  Other Schedules  

Other notable supplementary schedules to Form 1040 include:



Schedule F is used to report profits or losses from farming operations
Schedule H is used to report household employment taxes if you paid cash wages to household employees and those wages were subject to various Federal taxes
Schedule J is used to report farming or fishing trade income by averaging taxable income over the previous three years
Schedule R is used to report a credit for the elderly or disabled
Schedule SE is used to report the tax due on net earnings from self-employment
Schedule 8812 is used to report potentially refundable credits for qualifying children (or other dependents)


   Who Needs to File Form 1040  

If a United States citizen wants to or needs to file a Federal income tax return, they need to file Form 1040 or a variation of Form 1040 mentioned above. There are three general conditions to consider regarding whether an individual needs to file.



First, the IRS requires individuals with certain levels of gross income to file taxes. This threshold varies based on the individual's filing status and age. The table below lists the income limits for individuals under 65 years old. Keep in mind that older taxpayers tend to have higher thresholds, and the threshold changes if neither, one, or both individuals in a marriage are 65 or older.

Individuals with the gross income amounts below are required to file 2022 federal income taxes.



Source: Chart A - For Most People Who Must File (IRS)



Children and dependents may not be required to file if they can be claimed as a dependent. If the dependent's unearned income is greater than $1,100, earned income was greater than $12,550, or gross income meets certain thresholds, the dependent must file their own Form 1040. These rules are slightly different for single dependents as opposed to dependents who are married.



Finally, there are some specific situations that require an individual to file Form 1040. Regardless of their income or dependency status, some of those situations include but are not limited to:



You owe additional special taxes such as alternative minimum taxYou receive HSA or other health account distributionsYou had net earnings from self-employment of at least $400You met the income threshold limits for wages earned from a church




What Is Form 1040 Used for?
Form 1040 is the primary tax form used by U.S. taxpayers to file their annual income tax returns. Taxpayers input their personal information and tax information onto the form, then submit the form to the IRS for review.




Is Form 1040 the Same As a W-2?
Form 1040 is different than a W-2. A W-2 is a wage and tax statement an employee receives from a company they worked for during the tax year. The information listed on the W-2 is used to fill out Form 1040.




Where Can I Find Form 1040?
Form 1040 is not a tax statement or form that gets distributed to taxpayers. Unlike a W-2 or 1099 statement that is mailed by an employer or party you've contracted with, Form 1040 is available for download on the IRS website. In addition, free IRS filing platforms such as Free File Fillable Forms will provide digital copies. Last, some public courthouses or Federal buildings in your community may offer paper copies available for pick-up.




What Is the Difference Between a 1040 and 1099?
Form 1040 and Form 1099 are different components to an individual's tax return. There are many different types of Form 1099, but Form 1099 is most commonly given to independent contractors to remit tax information relating to payments they received during the tax year. This information is used to complete Form 1040, as the financial records listed on Form 1099 are input into Form 1040.


   The Bottom Line  

Form 1040 is the central part of tax filing for United States citizens. It is the tax form that all taxpayer financial statements eventually feed into and supporting tax schedules branch out of. Regardless of an individual's filing status or income, taxpayers who file taxes will complete some version of Form 1040.
What Was Form 1040-A: U.S. Individual Tax Return?  

Form 1040-A of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) was a simplified version of Form 1040 used by U.S. taxpayers to file an annual income tax return. To have been eligible to use Form 1040-A, an individual needed to meet certain requirements such as not itemizing deductions, not owning a business, and having a taxable income of less than $100,000. Unofficially known as the "short form," Form 1040-A was eliminated for the 2018 tax year in favor of the redesigned Form 1040 that debuted that year.





Key Takeaways

Form 1040-A was a simplified version of Form 1040 used for filing individual income tax. Filers using 1040-A were required to have less than $100,000 in taxable income and not have exercised any incentive stock options during the year.The IRS eliminated Form 1040-A for the 2018 tax year in favor of the redesigned Form 1040.Another variant of Form 1040 was Form 1040-EZ, which was even simpler than Form 1040-A and was also eliminated starting with the 2018 tax filing.


   Who Had to File Form 1040-A: U.S. Individual Tax Return?  

Most U.S. taxpayers use IRS Form 1040 to file their income tax returns. Form 1040 is a detailed form that offers taxpayers with complex investments, itemized deductions, multiple tax credits, and more than $100,000 in annual income more opportunities to lower their tax liability. Because additional paperwork is usually required with Form 1040, individuals with simpler tax situations previously had the option to use Form 1040-A instead.﻿﻿



Form 1040-A was a simplified version of Form 1040. The two-page form allowed taxpayers to report ordinary income, some deductions, and credits. Individuals who fell under any of the five status options—single, head of household, married filing separately, married filing jointly, or widowed—could file their tax returns using the 1040-A. Though Form 1040-A was available to taxpayers of any age and filing status, not everyone qualified to use this form.﻿﻿



Tax filers who used 1040-A must have earned less than $100,000 taxable income and not have exercised any incentive stock options (ISO) during the tax year. The income reported must have been earned as a wage, salary, tip, capital gain, dividend, interest income, unemployment compensation, pension, annuity, taxable Social Security and railroad retirement benefit, taxable scholarship or grant, and Alaska Permanent Fund dividend. Any other form of income, such as business income, needed to be reported on the more complex Form 1040.﻿﻿


   How Did Form 1040-A Work?  

Form 1040-A also gave taxpayers the opportunity to claim several tax deductions to reduce their taxable income. However, the only deductions they could claim included student loan interest, post-secondary tuition and fees, classroom expenses, and individual retirement account (IRA) contributions. Taxpayers using Form 1040-A could not claim itemized deductions. This limitation meant that if an individual qualified for other deductions from sources such as charitable donations or mortgage interest, and the total itemized deductible amount was more than the standard deductions, it would not have been advantageous for them to use 1040-A.



Form 1040-A also could be used to claim tax credits. Tax credits reduce the bottom line or total tax bill of a taxpayer. The credits that could be claimed using this form were the American Opportunity Tax Credit (AOTC), Earned Income Credit (EITC), child tax and additional child tax credit, child and dependent care credit, credits for the elderly or disabled, and retirement savings contribution credit.


   Form 1040-A vs. Form 1040-EZ  

Another variant of Form 1040 was Form 1040-EZ, which was even simpler and easier to fill out than Form 1040-A and was also eliminated starting with the 2018 tax filing. But with Form 1040-EZ, the individual had to file as either a single taxpayer or as married filing jointly; they could not claim deductions and could only claim the EIC.﻿﻿



Although Form 1040-A was slightly more complex than Form 1040-EZ, it was still relatively simple compared to 1040. Once their financial situation became complicated with dependents, special deductions, and credits—such as those associated with post-secondary education tuition—most taxpayers needed to switch from filing with the 1040-EZ to the 1040-A.



The redesigned Form 1040 that debuted with the 2018 tax year is designed to be much simpler to use than its predecessor. For this reason, the IRS eliminated both Form 1040-A and Form 1040-EZ.﻿﻿
What Was Form 1040EZ: Income Tax Return for Single and Joint Filers With No Dependents?  

IRS Form 1040EZ: Income Tax Return for Single and Joint Filers with No Dependents was the shortened version of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Form 1040. This form was for taxpayers with basic tax situations and offered a fast and easy way to file income taxes. 



The form was discontinued as of the 2018 tax year in favor of the redesigned Form 1040.





Key Takeaways

Form 1040EZ was a shortened version of Form 1040 for taxpayers with basic tax situations.The form was discontinued as of the 2018 tax year and replaced with the redesigned Form 1040.Form 1040EZ could only be used by people below age 65 with no dependents earning less than $100,000 per year.1040EZ was about one-fifth as long as the full 1040 form, with fewer deductions and tax credits.Anyone who hasn't filed taxes for 2017 or earlier can still use the 1040EZ form for that year.


   Eligibility for Form 1040EZ  

To use the form, a taxpayer had to have taxable income of less than $100,000, less than $1,500 of interest income, and claim no dependents. Other requirements for filing the Form 1040EZ included:



The taxpayer and their spouse, if married filing jointly, had to be under age 65 at the end of the relevant filing period.They could not be blind as of the end of the relevant filing period.The filer could take no deductions for student loan interest, educator expenses, tuition and fees, or itemized deductions.If the filer received interest income, they could not have been required to file Schedule B, didn’t have amounts in boxes 11, 12, or 13 of Form 1099-INT or boxes 6 and 10 of Form 1099-OID, and didn’t earn any interest as a nominee.Tax credits for retirement savings, health coverage, and education were not allowed.The tax filer could not have received any advance earned income credit (EIC), although they would have been allowed to claim the EIC when filing Form 1040EZ.The filer could not be a debtor in any Chapter 11 bankruptcy case that was filed after October 16, 2005.The filer, their spouse, if married filing jointly, or any of their dependents for which they claimed the personal exemption didn’t receive any advance payments of the premium tax credit offered for health coverage plans sold on the Marketplace.The filer doesn’t owe any household employee taxes on wages paid to household employees.






Anyone who hasn't filed a tax return using Form 1040EZ for tax years 2017 and earlier can still do so by going to the IRS website.



For most individuals, the 1040EZ was the first tax form they ever completed. Consider a typical high-school student employed part-time. Provided they met the income qualifications, the 1040EZ will likely be the most straightforward and appropriate form to file. 


   Limitations of Form 1040EZ  

Form 1040EZ was ultimately scrapped due to the limitations of the form. The IRS opted for the building block approach of allowing taxpayers to more easily add allowances or credits as applicable to their return. In addition, Form 1040EZ had several other drawbacks.



First, the form could only be used by those below a certain amount of income and types of income. Anyone who had income from sources other than wages, salaries, tips, taxable scholarships, or fellowship grants could not use Form 1040EZ. This precluded any taxpayer who received foreign income (or filed using a foreign address) from using the form. In addition, any taxpayer hoping to claim a dependent could also not use Form 1040EZ.



Because of the simplistic nature of Form 1040EZ, taxpayers were not allowed to itemize their deductions nor were they able to take other types of deductions such as student loan interest deduction or deductions for IRA contributions. The form also failed to allow taxpayers to report their health coverage; those who use Form 1040EZ were required to separately report their health coverage status.


   Form 1040EZ vs. Form 1040  

Form 1040EZ had only a few credits or deductions available to taxpayers. Filers were able to include an earned income credit (EIC) and elect nontaxable combat pay.



For most tax years, Form 1040 had 80% more lines than form 1040EZ. One significant difference was that Form 1040 had fields to include information about dependents, while 1040EZ did not allow individuals to claim dependents. Similar to the standard form, the EZ version had sections to record wages, salaries and tips, and taxable interest under $1,500. The filer was also able to include unemployment compensation payments.





1982

The first year that Form 1040EZ was introduced.



Form 1040EZ allowed filers to claim income from wages, tips, salaries, taxable grants or scholarships, the Alaska Permanent Fund, and unemployment compensation. Form 1040, though, had at least 16 income categories.



Categories available on the standard form included dividend payments, retirement account distributions, and farm and rental income. Form 1040 also allowed the entry of Social Security benefits, alimony, and other forms of income. This form also had a long list of deductions, ranging from education costs to healthcare savings plan contributions.




Is the 1040EZ Tax Form Still In Use?
The 1040EZ tax form was eliminated in 2018, and replaced with the redesigned Form 1040.




Is There a Form 1040EZ for 2022 or 2023?
No. The IRS no longer publishes Form 1040EZ, although it can still be used for tax years 2017 and earlier.




What Was the 1040EZ Tax Form Used for?
Form 1040EZ was used for taxpayers who fell into very basic income categories. For most years that 1040EZ was published, it could only be used by taxpayers below age 65, with no dependents and very little interest income. This form also had fewer tax credits and deductions than the full-length 1040 form, meaning that it was generally less appropriate for taxpayers with a higher income.




What Is the Difference Between IRS Forms 1040, 1040A and 1040EZ?
Form 1040A was a simplified tax form for taxpayers with an income below $100,000 who did not exercise any incentive stock options throughout the year. All three were eliminated in the 2018 tax year, and replaced with a redesigned Form 1040.


   The Bottom Line  

The IRS previously allowed for taxpayers to select a specific Form 1040 to use based on the complexity of their tax return. The simplest form for the most straight-forward returns could use Form 1040EZ. However, the form was discontinued in 2018, and all taxpayers must use Form 1040 as part of their annual filing.
What Is SEC Release IA-1092?  

SEC Release IA-1092 is a release from the Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) that provides uniform interpretations of how state and federal adviser laws apply to those that provide financial services.



SEC Release IA-1092 builds on the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 or the Advisers Act that Congress enacted to protect persons who rely on investment advisers for advice on purchasing and selling securities.





Key Takeaways

SEC Release IA-1092 clarifies how state and federal securities laws apply to investment advisers and financial planners.This memo, which was issued in 1987, expands on the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.IA-1092 defines the roles and duties of investment advisers and pension consultants, in particular.


   Understanding SEC Release IA-1092  

SEC Release IA-1092 is the result of a 1987 collaboration between the Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) on the federal side and the North American Securities Administrators Association (NASAA) on the state side.



These organizations issued IA-1092 in 1987 as a memo in response to the proliferation of financial planning and investment advice professionals in the 1980s. The act reaffirmed the definition of an investment adviser (IA) as described in SEC Release IA-770 and added some refinements:



First, pension consultants and advisers to athletes and entertainers were included as providers of investment advice.
Second, in some cases, firms that recommend investment advisers also had to register themselves.
Even if an IA did not render investment advice as their principal business activity, simply doing so with some regularity in many cases was enough to require registration.
If a registered representative of a broker-dealer set up a separate business entity to provide financial planning or investment advice for a fee, they were not allowed to rely on the broker-dealer (BD) exemption from registration. (This became known as a statutory investment adviser.)
Compensation did not have to be monetary to fall under the definition. Simply the receipt of products, services, or even discounts was also considered compensation.



With regard to sports or entertainment agents, those individuals that negotiated contracts but did not render investment advice were excluded from the definition of an investment adviser.


   SEC Release IA-1092 and the Investment Advisers Act of 1940  

The Investment Advisers Act of 1940 defines an investment adviser as any person who, either directly or indirectly through writings, engages in the business of advising others on the value or profitability of securities and receives compensation for this.



Guidelines for the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 can be found in Title 15 section 80b-1 of the United States Code, which notes that investment advisers are of national concern, due to:



Their advice, counsel, publications, writings, analyses, and reports being in line with interstate commerce.
Their work customarily relating to the purchase and sale of securities that trade on national securities exchanges and in interstate over-the-counter (OTC) markets.
Their connection with securities issued by companies engaged in interstate commerce.
The volume of transactions often materially affecting interstate commerce, national securities exchanges, other securities markets, the national banking system, and even the economy as a whole.
What Is the 11th District Cost of Funds Index?  

The 11th District Cost of Funds Index (COFI) is a monthly weighted average of the interest rates paid on checking and savings accounts offered by financial institutions operating in Arizona, California, and Nevada. It is one of many indices used by mortgage lenders to adjust the interest rate on adjustable rate mortgages (ARM) and was launched in 1981. With an ARM mortgage, the interest rate on a mortgage moves up and down along with some standard interest rate chosen by the lender, and COFI is one of the most popular indices in the western states.



Published on the last day of each month, the COFI represents the cost of funds for western savings institutions that are members of Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco, a self-regulatory agency, and satisfy the Bank's criteria for inclusion in the index.


   Understanding the 11th District COFI  

The 11th District Cost of Funds Index (COFI) is computed using several different factors, with interest paid on savings accounts comprising the largest weighting in the average. As a result, the index tends to have low volatility and follow market interest rate changes somewhat slowly; it is generally regarded as a two-month lagging indicator of market interest rates. The interest rate on a mortgage will not match the COFI, rather the ARM rate is typically 2% to 3% higher than COFI, depending on the borrower's credit history, the size and terms of the loan, the ability of the borrower to negotiate with the bank and many other factors.



Because it is computed using data from three western states, the COFI is primarily used in the western U.S., while the 1-year Treasury index is the measure of choice in the eastern region. On April 30, the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco announced the COFI for March 2018 of 0.814%, slightly lower than February.
What Is a 125% Loan?  

A 125% loan is a type of leveraged loan, typically a mortgage used to refinance a home, which allows a homeowner to borrow an amount equal to 125% of their property’s appraised value.



For example, if a home is worth $300,000, then a 125% loan would give the borrower access to $375,000 in funds.





Key Takeaways

A 125% loan is a mortgage equal to 1.25 times the value of the property securing the loan.Popular in the 1990s, 125%, and similar loans became increasingly risky and unmanageable during the 2007–08 housing bubble.Due to the risk involved for the lender, 125% loans carry significantly higher interest rates than traditional mortgages.Today, 125% loans are less common but are still available from some lenders.


   How a 125% Loan Works  

In financing terminology, a 125% loan has a loan-to-value (LTV) ratio of 125%. The LTV ratio, which compares the size of a loan relative to the appraised value of the property that serves as security, is used by lenders to judge a loan’s default risk. A 125% loan is considered riskier than one with an LTV ratio of less than 100%. In fact, with conventional mortgages, the loan size does not typically exceed 80% of a property’s value.



Therefore, according to the risk-based pricing method used by lenders, a loan with an LTV ratio of 125% will carry a higher interest rate than one with a lower LTV ratio—as much as double, in some instances.


   Using a 125% Loan for Refinancing  

Homeowners who take out a 125% loan usually do so when refinancing their homes to gain access to more cash than they would have available from their home equity. Their motive might be to use the loan to pay off other debts that carry even higher interest rates, such as credit cards.



But because 125% loans have high interest rates and may also have additional fees, anyone who is considering one should plan to shop around for the best terms they can get.



If your goal is to obtain cash to pay off other debt, and you are unable to qualify for a 125% loan (or you decide that you simply don’t want one), then you might still consider a home equity loan. You won’t get as much cash out of it, but the interest rate is likely to be considerably lower, and you can use it to pay off at least a portion of your high-interest debt. Another option would be to do a cash-out refinance.


   Advantages and Disadvantages of 125% Loans  

The advantage of a 125% loan is that it can allow a homeowner, especially one who has not accumulated too much home equity or whose property has actually declined in value, to obtain more cash than they otherwise could.



The disadvantage—to borrower and lender alike—is the added risk compared with a smaller loan. The borrower will be on the hook for more debt, and the lender will face added risk in case of a default. If the borrower does default, the lender can foreclose on the property and sell it, but the lender is very unlikely to get all of its money back.


   History of 125% Loans  

The 125% loans first became popular during the 1990s, in some cases geared toward low-risk borrowers with high credit scores who wanted to borrow more than their available home equity. Along with other factors, 125% loans played a role in the 2007–08 housing crisis. The crash of real estate markets around the country, kicked off by the subprime mortgage meltdown, left many people “underwater”—that is, they owed more money on their mortgage than their home was actually worth.



As home values dropped, some homeowners who wanted to refinance found that they no longer had enough equity in their homes to qualify for a new loan. Moreover, they could not recoup their losses even if they managed to sell the home.



The now-expired federal Home Affordable Refinance Program (HARP) was introduced in March 2009 as a way to offer relief. It allowed homeowners whose homes were underwater, but who were otherwise in good standing and current with their mortgages, to apply for refinancing. Through HARP, homeowners who owed up to 125% of the value of their homes could refinance at lower rates to help them pay off their debts and get on sounder financial footing.



Originally, homeowners who owed more than that percentage could not apply. But eventually, even the 125% LTV ceiling was removed, allowing still more homeowners to apply for HARP loans. After being extended several times, HARP ended in December 2018.




What Does 125% Financing Mean?
Typically, when refinancing a home, a homeowner can take out a 125% loan, meaning that they can borrow an amount equal to 125% of the home's appraised value. This type of financing comes into play when the house is worth less than what is owed on it.




Can You Get a 90% LTV?
A 90% LTV means a 90% loan-to-value ratio. This is a comparison between your mortgage and the value of your home. So for example, a $300,000 home and a $270,000 mortgage, would have a 90% loan-to-value ratio. To achieve this, you would need a downpayment of 10% of the home's value: $30,000. In the U.S., most homes require a 20% downpayment. In this example, that would result in an LTV of 80%.




Can I Take Equity Out of My House Without Refinancing?
Yes, you can take equity out of your house without refinancing. Ways to do this include home equity loans, home equity lines of credit, and home equity investments.
What Is a 12B-1 Fee?  

A 12b-1 fee is an annual marketing or distribution fee on a mutual fund. The 12b-1 fee is considered to be an operational expense and, as such, is included in a fund's expense ratio. It is generally between 0.25% and 0.75% (the maximum allowed) of a fund's net assets. The fee gets its name from a section of the Investment Company Act of 1940.


   Understanding 12B-1 Fees  

Back in the early days of the mutual fund business, the 12b-1 fee was thought to help investors. It was believed that by marketing a mutual fund, its assets would increase and management could lower expenses because of economies of scale. This has yet to be proven. With mutual fund assets passing the $10 trillion mark and growing steadily, critics of this fee are seriously questioning the justification for using it. Today, the 12b-1 fee is mainly used to reward intermediaries for selling a fund's shares. As a commission paid to salespersons, it is currently believed to do nothing to enhance the performance of a fund.



In 2015, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) began examining the use of 12b-1 fees to determine if the rules for charging these fees are being adhered to and the presence of such fees is being properly disclosed.


   12b-1 Fee Broken Down  

The 12b-1 fee can be broken down into two distinct charges: the distribution and marketing fee and the service fee. Total 12b-1 fees charged by a fund are limited to 1% annually. The distribution and marketing piece of the fee is capped at 0.75% annually, while the service fee portion of the fee can be up to 0.25%.


   Use of 12b-1 in Broker-Sold Shares  

Class B and class C shares of broker-sold funds typically have 12b-1 fees, but they may also be charged on no-load mutual fund shares and class A broker-sold shares.



Class A shares, which usually charge a front-end load but no back-end load, may come with a reduced 12b-1 expense but normally don't come with the maximum 1% fee. Class B shares, which typically carry no front-end but charge a back-end load that decreases as time passes, often come with a 12b-1 fee. Class C shares usually have the greatest likelihood of carrying the maximum 1% 12b-1 fee. The presence of a 12b-1 fee frequently pushes the overall expense ratio on a fund to above 2%.



The Calamos Growth Fund is an example of a fund that carries a smaller 0.25% 12b-1 fee on its class A shares and charges the maximum 1% 12b-1 fee on its class C shares.


   What 12b-1 Fees Are Used For  

The distribution fee covers marketing and paying brokers who sell shares. They also go toward advertising the fund and mailing fund literature and prospectuses to clients. Shareholder service fees, another form, specifically pay for the fund to hire people to answer investor inquiries and distribute information when necessary, though these fees may be required without the adoption of a 12b-1 plan. Another category of fees that can be charged is known as "other expenses." Other expenses can include costs associated with legal, accounting, and administrative services. They may also pay for transfer agent and custodial fees.
What Is a 12b-1 Fund?  

A 12b-1 fund is a mutual fund that charges its holders a 12b-1 fee. A 12b-1 fee pays for a mutual fund’s distribution and marketing costs. It is often used as a commission to brokers for selling the fund.



12b-1 funds take a portion of investment assets held and use them to pay expensive fees and distribution costs. These costs are included in the fund's expense ratio and are described in the prospectus. 12b-1 fees are sometimes called a “level load.”





Key Takeaways

A 12b-1 fund carries a 12b-1 fee, which covers a fund's sales and distribution costs.This fee is a percentage of the fund's market value, as opposed to funds that charge a load or sales fee.12b-1 fees include the cost of marketing and selling fund shares, paying brokers and other sellers of the funds, as well as advertising costs, such as printing and mailing fund prospectuses to investors. Once popular, 12b-1 funds have lost investor interest in recent years, particularly amid the rise of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and low-cost mutual funds.


   Understanding 12b-1 Funds  

The name 12b-1 comes from the Investment Company Act of 1940's Rule 12b-1, which allows fund companies to act as distributors of their own shares. Rule 12b-1 further states that a mutual fund's own assets can be used to pay distribution charges.



Distribution fees include fees paid for marketing and selling fund shares, such as compensating brokers and others who sell fund shares and paying for advertising, the printing and mailing of prospectuses to new investors, and the printing and mailing of sales literature. The SEC does not limit the size of 12b-1 fees that funds may pay, but under FINRA rules, 12b-1 fees that are used to pay marketing and distribution expenses (as opposed to shareholder service expenses) cannot exceed 0.75% of a fund’s average net assets per year.


   12b-1 Fees  

Some 12b-1 plans also authorize and include "shareholder service fees," which are fees paid to persons to respond to investor inquiries and provide investors with information about their investments. A fund may pay shareholder service fees without adopting a 12b-1 plan. If shareholder service fees are part of a fund’s 12b-1 plan, these fees will be included in this category of the fee table.



If shareholder service fees are paid outside a 12b-1 plan, then they will be included in the "Other expenses" category, discussed below. FINRA imposes an annual 0.25% cap on shareholder service fees (regardless of whether these fees are authorized as part of a 12b-1 plan).



Originally, the rule was intended to pay advertising and marketing expenses; today, however, a very small percentage of the fee tends to go toward these costs.





0.75%

0.75% is the current maximum amount of a fund's net assets that an investor can be charged as a 12b-1 fee.


   Special Considerations  

12b-1 funds have fallen out of favor in recent years. The growth in exchange-traded fund (ETF) options and the subsequent growth of low-fee mutual fund options has given consumers a wide range of option. Notably, 12b-1 fees are considered a dead weight, and experts believe consumers who shop around can find comparable funds to ones charging 12b-1 fees.
What Is a 12B-1 Plan?  

A 12B-1 plan is a plan structured by mutual fund companies for the distribution of funds through intermediaries. 12B-1 plans provide mapping for the partnerships between distributors and intermediaries who help to ensure the sale of a fund. Sales commission schedules and 12B-1 distribution expenses are the primary components driving a 12B-1 plan.


   Understanding the 12B-1 Plan  

12B-1 plans facilitate the partnerships between distributors and intermediaries offering mutual fund shares. 12B-1 plans are primarily focused on open-end mutual funds, which have multiple class structures for sales charges and distribution expenses. Mutual fund companies consider two types of 12B-1 charges in their 12B-1 plans, sales commissions, and 12B-1 expenses.


   Sales Commissions  

Sales commission schedules are structured to provide compensation to intermediaries for transacting mutual funds. These partnerships can help to increase demand for funds by being marketed from a full-service broker-dealer who facilitates the transaction for a sales load fee. These fees are paid to the broker and are not associated with annual fund operating expenses.



Sales loads are structured to vary across share classes. Share classes can include front-end, back-end, and level-load sales charges. These sales charges are associated with individual retail share classes which typically include Class A, B, and C shares.﻿﻿


   12B-1 Expenses  

12B-1 expenses paid from the mutual fund to distributors and intermediaries are also a key part of a 12B-1 plan. To market and distribute open-end mutual fund shares, mutual fund companies work with distributors to get their funds listed with discount brokerages and financial advisor platforms. Distributors help fund companies partner with the full-service brokers that transact their funds at the agreed-upon sales load schedule.



Mutual fund companies will pay 12B-1 fees from a mutual fund to compensate distributors.﻿﻿ In some cases, funds may also be structured with a low-level load that is paid to financial advisors annually during the course of an investor's holding period.



Financial industry legislation typically restricts 12B-1 fees to 1% of the current value of the investment on an annual basis, but fees generally fall somewhere between 0.25% and 1%. In most cases, fund companies will have higher 12B-1 fees on share classes paying a lower sales charge, and lower 12B-1 fees on share classes with higher sales charges. This helps to balance out the compensation paid to intermediary brokers while also providing for payment to distribution partners.﻿﻿


   Disclosure  

Mutual fund companies are required to provide full disclosure on their sales load schedules and 12B-1 annual fund expenses in the fund’s prospectus. The prospectus is one aspect of documentation required for the mutual fund’s registration and is also the key offering document providing information on the fund for investors.﻿﻿ 12B-1 plans and any changes to their expense structuring must be approved by the fund’s board of directors and amended in its prospectus filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
What Is the 130-30 Strategy?  

The 130-30 strategy, often called a long/short equity strategy, refers to an investing methodology used by institutional investors. A 130-30 designation implies using a ratio of 130% of starting capital allocated to long positions and accomplishing this by taking in 30% of the starting capital from shorting stocks.



The strategy is employed in a fund for capital efficiency. It uses financial leverage by shorting poor-performing stocks and, with the cash received by shorting those stocks, purchasing shares that are expected to have high returns. Often, investors will mimic an index such as the S&P 500 when choosing stocks for this strategy.





Key Takeaways

This investing strategy makes use of shorting stocks and putting the cash from shorting those shares to work buying and holding the best-ranked stocks for a designated period.These strategies tend to work well for limiting the drawdown that comes in investing.They do not appear to keep up with major averages in total returns but do have better risk-adjusted returns.


   Understanding the 130-30 Strategy  

To engage in a 130-30 strategy, an investment manager might rank the stocks used in the S&P 500 from best to worse on expected return, as signaled by past performance. A manager will use a number of data sources and rules for ranking individual stocks. Typically, stocks are ranked according to some set selection criteria (for example, total returns, risk-adjusted performance, or relative strength) over a designated look-back period of six months or one year. The stocks are then ranked best to worst.



From the best ranking stocks, the manager would invest 100% of the portfolio's value and short sell the bottom ranking stocks, up to 30% of the portfolio's value. The cash earned from the short sales would be reinvested into top-ranking stocks, allowing for greater exposure to the higher-ranking stocks.


   130-30 Strategy and Shorting Stocks  

The 130-30 strategy incorporates short sales as a significant part of its activity. Shorting a stock entails borrowing securities from another party, most often a broker, and agreeing to pay an interest rate as a fee. A negative position is subsequently recorded in the investor’s account. The investor then sells the newly acquired securities on the open market at the current price and receives the cash for the trade. The investor waits for the securities to depreciate and then re-purchases them at a lower price. At this point, the investor returns the purchased securities to the broker. In a reverse activity from first buying and then selling securities, shorting still allows the investor to profit.



Short selling is much riskier than investing in long positions in securities; thus, in a 130-30 investment strategy, a manager will put more emphasis on long positions than short positions. Short-selling puts an investor in a position of unlimited risk and a capped reward. For example, if an investor shorts a stock trading at $30, the most they can gain is $30 (minus fees), while the most they can lose is infinite since the stock can technically increase in price forever.



Hedge funds and mutual fund firms have begun offering investment vehicles in the way of private equity funds, mutual funds, or even exchange-traded funds that follow variations of the 130-30 strategy. In general, these instruments have lower volatility than benchmark indexes but often fail to achieve greater total returns.
What Is an 18-Hour City?  

Economists and real estate investors use the term 18-hour city to describe a mid-size city with attractive amenities, higher-than-average population growth, and a lower cost of living and cost of doing business than the biggest urban areas. The 18-hour city generally has a population of under one million, making it a second-tier city.



Eighteen-hour cities in the U.S. are increasingly seen as viable alternatives for investment and living to the Big Six markets of Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles, New York, San Francisco and Washington, D.C that make up America's first-tier or 24-hour cities.


   Understanding the 18-Hour City  

While loosely defined, the term 18-hour city most often refers to a city that has public services, amenities and job opportunities that are comparable in quality to those in the big six markets.





Key Takeaways

Eighteen-hour cities are vibrant smaller metro areas that are proving attractive to new residents, entrepreneurs and investors.They boast lower living costs along with solid infrastructure and appealing amenities.Many have emerged as alternatives to big cities for starting or relocating a business or investing in real estate.



Unlike the biggest cities, most of their services and amenities don't operate on a 24-hour basis. However, they boast comparable advantages, including solid public transportation systems, modern infrastructure and strong economies. Housing prices are moderate in comparison.


  The 18-Hour City Advantage  

Eighteen-hour cities have emerged as an attractive alternative to big cities for starting a new business, relocating an existing one, or investing in real estate. They typically feature lower capitalization rate compression, meaning property values tend to remain stable rather than spiking up or down significantly.



Like first-tier cities, 18-hour cities often boast low real estate vacancy rates along with favorable supply concentrations, rental growth and absorption trends—all indicators of long-term real estate investment potential.



Aside from the numbers, Forbes.com cites a distinctive and lovable culture as a key factor in creating and maintaining a vibrant 18-hour city: "Austin is the live music capital of the world. Denver and the Research Triangle are outdoor meccas. Portland is just plain weird (and residents would like to keep it that way."



One perceived downside is the increased risk inherent in cities that do not have the established track record of primary market cities.


   Examples of 18-Hour Cities in the U.S.  

CrowdStreet, a site for crowd-sourced real estate investments, cites Austin, Denver, and Nashville as recent stars among 18-hour cities. In 2020, it identified Charleston, South Carolina, as the next big success story in the category.






The stars among 18-hour cities are a draw for millennials turned off by big-city obstacles.



Realtor.com identified its top metropolitan areas for 2020 and beyond, with all of its top five picks squarely in the 18-hour city category. They include Boise, Idaho; Mc-Allen-Edinburg-Mission, Texas; Tucson, Arizona; Chattanooga, Tennessee, and Columbia, South Carolina.



The National Real Estate Investor website chose Charleston, Kansas City, and Columbus, Ohio, based on their stellar growth in jobs.


  Follow the Millennials  

These and other frequently-cited 18-hour city stars have become targets for millennials whose goal is launching or advancing their careers. They are characterized by the availability of recreation and entertainment opportunities that extend well beyond what the typical second-tier affords.



Employers are drawn to 18-hour cities because doing business is less expensive in these markets and this, in turn, attracts large numbers of job seekers and entrepreneurs.
What Is the 183-Day Rule?  

The 183-day rule is used by most countries to determine if someone should be considered a resident for tax purposes. In the U.S., the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) uses 183 days as a threshold in the "substantial presence test," which determines whether people who are neither U.S. citizens nor permanent residents should still be considered residents for taxation.





Key Takeaways


The 183-day rule refers to criteria used by many countries to determine if they should tax someone as a resident.
The 183rd day marks the majority of the year.
The U.S. Internal Revenue Service uses a more complicated formula, including a portion of days from the previous two years as well as the current year.
The U.S. has treaties with other countries concerning what taxes are required and to whom, as well as what exemptions apply, if any.
U.S. citizens and residents may exclude up to $108,700 of their foreign-earned income in 2021 if they meet the physical presence test and paid taxes in the foreign country.



   Understanding the 183-Day Rule  

The 183rd day of the year marks a majority of the days in a year, and for this reason countries around the world use the 183-day threshold to broadly determine whether to tax someone as a resident. These include Canada, Australia, and the United Kingdom, for example. Generally, this means that if you spent 183 days or more in the country during a given year, you are considered a tax resident for that year.



Each nation subject to the 183-day rule has its own criteria for considering someone a tax resident. For example, some use the calendar year for its accounting period, whereas some use a fiscal year. Some include the day the person arrives in their country in their count, while some do not.



Some countries have even lower thresholds for residency. For example, Switzerland considers you a tax resident if you have spent more than 90 days there.﻿﻿


   The IRS and the 183-Day Rule  

The IRS uses a more complicated formula to reach 183 days and determine whether someone passes the substantial presence test. To pass the test, and thus be subject to U.S. taxes, the person in question must:



Have been physically present at least 31 days during the current year and;Present 183 days during the three-year period that includes the current year and the two years immediately preceding it.



Those days are counted as:



All of the days they were present during the current yearOne-third of the days they were present during the previous yearOne-sixth of the days present two years previously


   Other IRS Terms and Conditions  

The IRS generally considers someone to have been present in the U.S. on a given day if they spent any part of a day there. But there are some exceptions.



Days that do not count as days of presence include:



Days that you commute to work in the U.S. from a residence in Canada or Mexico if you do so regularlyDays you are in the U.S. for less than 24 hours while in transit between two other countriesDays you are in the U.S. as a crew member of a foreign vesselDays you are unable to leave the U.S. because of a medical condition that develops while you are thereDays in which you qualify as exempt, which includes foreign-government-related persons under an A or G visa, teachers and trainees under a J or Q visa; a student under an F, J, M, or Q visa; and a professional athlete competing for charity


   U.S. Citizens and Resident Aliens  

Strictly speaking, the 183-day rule does not apply to U.S. citizens and permanent residents. U.S. citizens are required to file tax returns regardless of their country of residence or the source of their income.



However, they may exclude at least part of their overseas earned income (up to $108,700 in 2021) from taxation provided they meet a physical presence test in the foreign country and paid taxes there. To meet the physical presence test, the person needs to be present in the country for 330 complete days in 12 consecutive months.






Individuals residing in another country and in violation of U.S. law will not be allowed to have their incomes qualify as foreign-earned.


   U.S. Tax Treaties and Double Taxation  

The U.S. has tax treaties with other countries to determine jurisdiction for income tax purposes and to avoid double taxation of their citizens. These agreements contain provisions for the resolution of conflicting claims of residence.



Residents of these partner nations are taxed at a lower rate and may be exempt from U.S. taxes for certain types of income earned in the U.S. Residents and citizens of the U.S. are also taxed at a reduced rate and may be exempt from foreign taxes for certain income earned in other countries. It is important to note that some states do not honor these tax treaties.


   183 Day Rule FAQs   
  How Many Days Can You Be in the U.S. Without Paying Taxes?  

The IRS considers you a U.S. resident if you were physically present in the U.S. on at least 31 days of the current year and 183 days during a three-year period. The three-year period consists of the current year and the prior two years. The 183-day rule includes all the days present in the current year, 1/3 of the days you were present in year 2, and 1/6 of the days you were present in year 1.


  How Long Do You Have to Live in a State Before You’re Considered a Resident?  

Many states use the 183-day rule to determine residency for tax purposes, and what constitutes a day varies among states. For instance, any time spent in New York, except for travel to destinations outside of New York (e.g., airport travel), is considered a day. So, if you work in Manhattan but live in New Jersey, you may still be considered a New York resident for tax purposes even if you never spend one night there.



It is important to consult the laws of each state that you frequent to determine if you are required to pay their income taxes. Also, some states have special agreements whereby a resident who works in another state is only required to pay taxes in the state of their permanent residence—where they are domiciled.


  How Do I Calculate the 183-Day Rule?  

For most countries that apply this rule, you are a tax resident of that country if you spend 183 or more there. The United States, however, has additional criteria for applying the 183-rule. If you were physically present in the U.S. on at least 31 days of the current year and 183 days during a three-year period, you are a U.S. resident for tax purposes. Additional stipulations apply to the three-year threshold.


  How Do I Know if I Am a Resident for Tax Purposes?  

If you meet the IRS criteria for being qualified as a resident for tax purposes and none of the qualified exceptions apply, you are a U.S. resident. You are a tax resident if you were physically present in the U.S. for 31 days of the current year and 183 days in the last three years, including the days present in the current year, 1/3 of the days from the previous year, and 1/6 of the days from the first year.



The IRS also has rules regarding what constitutes a day. For example, commuting to work from a neighboring country (e.g., Mexico and Canada) does not count as a day. Also, exempt from this test are certain foreign government-related individuals, teachers, students, and professional athletes temporarily in the United States.


  Do I Meet the Substantial Presence Test?  

It is important to consult the laws of the country for which the test will be performed. If wanting to find out about meeting the U.S.'s substantial presence test, you must consider the number of days present within the last three years.



First, you must have been physically present in the United States for 31 days of the current year. If so, count the full number of days present for the current year. Then, multiply the number of days present in year 1 by 1/6 and the days in year 2 by 1/3. Sum the totals. If the result is 183 or more, you are a resident. Lastly, if none of the IRS qualifying exceptions apply, you are a resident.
What Was the 1979 Energy Crisis?  

The 1979 energy crisis, the second of two oil price shocks in the '70s, resulted in a widespread panic about potential gasoline shortages, and far higher prices for both crude oil and refined products. Oil output declined by only 7% or less, but the short-term supply disruption led to a spike in prices, panic buying, and long lines at gas stations. 





Key Takeaways

The energy crisis of 1979 was one of two oil price shocks during the 1970s—the other was in 1973.Higher prices and concerns about supplies led to panic buying in the gasoline market.Crude oil prices nearly doubled to almost $40 per barrel in twelve months.The energy crisis of 1979 led to the development of smaller, more fuel-efficient vehicles.OPEC's market share fell sharply and utility companies moved toward alternative energy sources.


   Understanding the 1979 Energy Crisis  

The 1979 energy crisis occurred in the aftermath of the Iranian Revolution, which started in early 1978 and ended in early 1979 with the fall of Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, the state’s monarch. Turmoil in Iran, a major petroleum exporting country, caused the global supply of crude oil to decline significantly, triggering noteworthy shortages, and a surge in panic buying—within 12 months, the price per barrel of this widely used resource almost doubled to $39.50.



Short-run disruptions in the global supply of gasoline and diesel fuel were particularly acute in the spring and early summer of 1979. Several states responded by rationing gasoline, including California, New York, Pennsylvania, Texas, and New Jersey. In these populous states, consumers could only purchase gas every other day, based on whether the last digit of their license plate numbers was even or odd. 



The gasoline shortage also led to fears that heating oil might be in short supply through the 1979-1980 winter. This prospect was especially concerning for New England states, where demand for home heating oil was the highest.


   Special Considerations  

It would be erroneous to blame the crisis solely on the fall of the Shah. Notably, the U.S. faced more-acute pain from the crisis than other developed countries in Europe, which also depended on oil from Iran and other Middle East countries. Part of the reason behind the crisis had to do with fiscal policy decisions in the U.S.


  U.S. Fiscal Policy Also to Blame  

In early 1979, the U.S. government regulated oil prices. Regulators ordered refiners to restrict the supply of gasoline in the early days of the crisis to build inventories, directly contributing to higher prices at the pump.



Another factor was unintended supply restriction after the Department of Energy (DOE) decided to make a handful of large U.S. refiners sell crude to smaller refiners who could not find a ready supply of oil. Because smaller refiners had limited production capabilities, the decision further delayed gasoline supply.



Monetary policy leading up to the crisis also seemingly played a role to a degree. The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) was reluctant to raise target interest rates too quickly and this hesitation contributed to rising inflation late in the decade. The jump in inflation was accompanied by higher prices for energy and a range of other consumer products and services.


   Benefits of the 1979 Energy Crisis  

Amid the crisis, politicians actively encouraged consumers to conserve energy and limit unnecessary travel. In subsequent years, the 1979 crisis led to the sale of more compact and subcompact vehicles in the U.S. These smaller vehicles had smaller engines and provided better fuel economy.



In addition, the crisis prompted utility companies worldwide to seek out alternatives to crude oil generators, including nuclear power plants, and governments to spend billions on the research and development (R&D) of other fuel sources.



Combined, these efforts resulted in daily worldwide oil consumption declining in the six years following the crisis. Meanwhile, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) global market share fell to 29% in 1985, down from 50% in 1979.
A 2-1 buydown is a mortgage agreement that provides for a low interest rate for the first year of the loan, a somewhat higher rate for the second year, and then the full rate for the third and later years.





Key Takeaways

A 2-1 buydown is a type of financing that lowers the interest rate on a mortgage for the first two years before it rises to the regular, permanent rate.The rate is typically two percentage points lower during the first year and one percentage point lower in the second year.Sellers, including home builders, may offer a 2-1 buydown to make a property more attractive to buyers.2-1 buydowns can be a good deal for homebuyers, provided that they will be able to afford the higher monthly payments once those begin.


   How 2-1 Buydowns Work  

A buydown is a real estate financing technique that makes it easier for a borrower to qualify for a mortgage with a lower interest rate. That lower rate can last for the duration of the mortgage (as is often the case when borrowers pay extra points up front to the lender) or for a particular period of time. A 2-1 buydown is one kind of temporary buydown, in this case lasting for two years.



In a 2-1 buydown, the interest rate will increase from one year to the next until it settles into its permanent rate in year three. To make up for the interest that they won’t be receiving in those early years, lenders will charge an additional fee.



Either a homebuyer or a home seller can pay for a buydown. That payment may be in the form of mortgage points or a lump sum deposited in an escrow account with the lender and used to subsidize the borrower’s reduced monthly payments.



Sellers, including home builders, often use 2-1 buydowns as an incentive for potential purchasers.


   Example of a 2-1 Buydown Mortgage  

Suppose a real estate developer is offering a 2-1 buydown on its new homes. If the prevailing interest rate on 30-year mortgages is 5%, a homebuyer could get a mortgage that charged just 3% in the first year, then 4% in the second year, and 5% after that.



If the homebuyer took out a $200,000, 30-year mortgage, for example, then their monthly payments during the first year would be $843. In the second year, they would pay $995. After the end of the second year, their monthly payment would rise to $1,074, where it would stay for the remainder of the mortgage.


   2-1 Buydown Pros and Cons  

For home sellers, a 2-1 buydown can help them by making it easier and sometimes faster for them to sell their homes for a good price. The downside, of course, is that it comes at a cost, which ultimately reduces how much they will net from the sale.



For homebuyers, a 2-1 buydown has several potential benefits. For one thing, it can help them afford a larger mortgage and a more expensive home than they might otherwise qualify for. For another, it buys them some time before their mortgage payments rise to the full amount, which can be helpful if their income is also rising from year to year.



The downside for homebuyers is the risk that their income won’t keep pace with those increasing mortgage payments. In that case, they might find themselves stretched too thin and even have to sell the home.


   When to Use a 2-1 Buydown  

Home sellers may want to consider offering (and paying for) a 2-1 buydown if they’re having difficulty selling and need to provide an incentive to find a buyer.



Borrowers may benefit from a buydown if it allows them to buy the home they want at a price they can afford. However, they will also want to consider what would happen if their income doesn’t rise fast enough to keep up with their future monthly payments.



Buyers should also make sure that they are getting a fair deal on the home in the first place. That’s because some sellers might increase the home’s price to make up for the cost of the 2-1 buydown.



Note that buydowns may not be available under some state and federal mortgage programs or from all lenders. A 2-1 buydown is available on fixed-rate Federal Housing Administration (FHA) loans, but only for new mortgages and not for refinancing. Terms can also vary from lender to lender.
Homebuyers face may choices in types of mortgages, from longer-term fixed rate loans to shorter-term adjustable-rate loans. A 2/28 adjustable-rate mortgage is one type of adjustable rate mortgage that is less common than the traditional 30-year fixed mortgage, but it may suit some buyers' needs.



A 2/28 mortgage essentially offers a two-year fixed interest rate followed by a floating rate for 28 years. Learn how this type of mortgage works, and more about the pros and cons.


   What Is a 2/28 Adjustable-Rate Mortgage (2/28 ARM)?  

A 2/28 adjustable-rate mortgage (2/28 ARM) is a type of 30-year home loan that has an initial two-year fixed interest rate period. After this two-year period, the rate floats based on an index rate plus a margin.



The initial teaser rate is typically below the average rate of conventional mortgages, but the adjustable rate can then rise significantly. Since banks don’t make much money on the initial teaser rate, 2/28 ARMs include hefty prepayment penalties during the first two years.





Key Takeaways

2/28 adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs) offer an introductory fixed rate for two years, after which the interest rate adjusts semiannually for 28 more years.When ARMs adjust, interest rates change based on their marginal rates and the indexes to which they’re tied.Homeowners generally have lower mortgage payments during the introductory period, but are subject to interest rate risk afterward.


   Understanding 2/28 Adjustable-Rate Mortgages (2/28 ARMs)  

The 2/28 ARMs became popular during the real estate boom of the early 2000s, when soaring prices put conventional mortgage payments out of reach for many buyers.



Other ARM structures exist, such as 5/1, 5/5, and 5/6 ARMs, which feature a five-year introductory period followed by a rate adjustment every five years or every six months, respectively. Notably, 15/15 ARMs adjust once after 15 years and then remain fixed for the remainder of the loan.



Less common are the 2/28 and 3/27 ARMs. With the former, the fixed interest rate applies for only the first two years, followed by 28 years of adjustable rates. With the latter, the fixed rate is for three years, with adjustments in each of the following 27 years. In these cases, rates adjust semiannually.


   Example of 2/28 ARM  

For example, let's say you are buying a $350,000 home and providing a down payment of $50,000. You have a $300,000 2/28 ARM mortgage with an initial interest rate of 5% and monthly payments of $1,906. (Total monthly mortgage payments vary when property taxes and insurance costs are factored in. This example assumes $230 per month in property tax and $66 per month in insurance costs.)



With a 2/28 ARM, your interest rate of 5% remains fixed for two years. Then, it can change based on changes in a broader index rate. Let's say your interest rate then rises to 5.3%. Your total monthly costs would rise to $1,961. Your interest rate would continue to change over the remainder of the loan depending on the broader index. So, the total costs of the loan would be difficult to estimate.



In comparison, if you had a 30-fixed mortgage on the same loan with 5% interest, you would pay $1,906 per month and you can expect to pay $279,987 in total interest if you did not pay the loan off early.


   Risks of 2/28 ARMs  

The risk with an adjustable-rate mortgages like an 2/28 ARM is the potential for the rate to increase. After two years, the rate is adjusted every six months, typically upward, by a margin above an index rate, such as the federal funds rate or the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR). 2/28 ARMs have some built-in safety features, such as a lifetime interest rate cap and limits on how much the rate can change with each period. But even with caps, homeowners can face significant payment spikes in volatile markets.



During the boom, many homeowners failed to understand how a seemingly small rate increase could dramatically boost their monthly payment. And even many of those who were fully aware of the risks viewed 2/28 ARMs as a short-term financing vehicle. The idea was to take advantage of the low teaser rate, then refinance after two years to either a conventional mortgage. Or, if their credit was not good enough, they would refinance to a new adjustable mortgage. Amid spiking real estate prices, this strategy kicked the debt further down the road. To many, this made a certain amount of sense since, after all, the borrower’s home equity was rising fast.



But with the market collapse in 2008, home values plummeted. Many owners with 2/28 ARMs found were unable to refinance, make their payments, or sell their homes for the value of the outstanding loan. The rash of foreclosures led to stricter loan standards. Today, banks more carefully evaluate a borrower’s ability to make adjustable-rate payments.


   2/28 ARM vs. Fixed Rate Mortgage  

Adjustable-rate mortgages like a 2/28 ARM work differently than fixed-rate mortgages and this difference is important to understand for planning your long-term finances.



An adjustable rate mortgage will have an interest rate that can change. That means your monthly payments can change and the overall total interest you will pay is unpredictable. Because the interest can change, you will need to prepare for the possibility that you will have to make higher monthly payments.



In contrast, interest on a fixed-rate mortgage does not change. You can plan for the same monthly payment for the life of the loan. A 2/28 ARM offers the fixed rate for only the first two years, after which the rate can adjust.


   Is a 2/28 Adjustable-Rate Mortgage Right for You?  

A 2/28 adjustable-rate mortgage has advantages and disadvantages that make it ideal for some buyers but not for others. Weigh the pros and cons with your own financial situation to determine if this type of mortgage is right for you.



You may benefit from a 2/28 ARM if you need a lower monthly payment at the beginning of your mortgage and if you believe you will be able to make higher monthly payments in the future. However if you can afford a higher monthly payment, you may save more money in total interest costs with other loan options, such as a 15-year fixed-rate loan.




What are the Disadvantages of an Adjustable-Rate Mortgage?
An adjustable-rate mortgage can provide lower monthly payments at the beginning of the loan, but borrowers need to prepare for the potential that their payments can increase. If the interest rate increases, then monthly costs and total borrowing costs increase.




What is a 5/1 ARM with a 30-year Term?
With a 5/1 adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM), your interest rate is fixed, or remains the same, for the first five years. Then, it adjusts once a year. When these mortgages have a 30-year term, that means you will have a fixed interest rate for five years and an adjustable rate for the next 25 years. These loans are also known as 5/1 hybrid adjustable-rate mortgages.




Can You Pay off an ARM Loan Early?
Whether you can pay off an adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM) early depends on the terms of your loan. With some ARMs, you may face a prepayment penalty if you pay the loan off early, including if you sell the home or refinance the loan.
What Is the 2000 Investor Limit?  

The 2,000 Investor Limit is a stipulation required by the Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) that mandates a company that exceeds 2,000 individual investors, and with more than $10 million in combined assets, must file its financials with the commission. According to SEC rules, a company that meets these criteria has 120 days to file following its fiscal year's end.





Key Takeaways

The 2,000 investor limit or rule is a key threshold for private businesses that do not wish to disclose financial information for public consumption.A business with more than 2,000 distinct shareholders, totaling $10 million or more in capital, must file with the SEC even if it is a privately-held company.Congress raised the limit from 500 individual investors to 2,000 investors in 2016 as part of the JOBS and FAST Acts.﻿﻿The increased investor limit has opened greater possibility for equity crowdfunding.


   Understanding the 2000 Investor Limit  

The 2,000 investor limit or rule is a key threshold for private businesses that do not wish to disclose financial information for public consumption. Congress raised the limit from 500 individual investors in 2016 as part of the Jumpstart Our Business Startups (JOBS) Act and Title LXXXV of the Fixing America’s Surface Transportation (FAST) Act. The revised rules also specify a limit of 500 persons who are not accredited investors before public filing is required.﻿﻿



The prior threshold had been 500 holders of record without regard to accredited investor status. Congress began debating an increase in the limit in the wake of the 2008 recession and an explosion in online businesses (some of which complained that they were growing so fast that the disclosure rules had become a burden at too early a stage of their lifecycle). 



The JOBS Act also set up a separate registration threshold for banks and bank holding companies, allowing them to terminate the registration of securities or suspend reporting if that class of shares is held by less than 1,200 people.


   Investor Thresholds and Equity Crowdfunding  

The JOBS Act revisions to SEC rules helped facilitate the growth of crowdfunding platforms. These platforms are able to raise money from individual investors online without providing detailed financial data. The rules established limits on how much individuals can invest in SEC-approved crowdfunding platforms as a percent of the lesser of their annual income or net worth. 



The individual limits for crowdfunding, through an investment portal approved by the SEC, as of May 2017:﻿﻿ ﻿﻿



If either your annual income or your net worth is under $107,000, during any 12-month period, you can invest up to the greater of either $2,200 or 5 percent of the lesser of your annual income or net worth. If both your annual income and net worth are $107,000 or more during any 12-month period, you can invest up to 10 percent of your annual income or net worth, whichever is less, not to exceed $107,000. 



These calculations don't include the value of your home.


   Example  

For example, suppose that your annual income is $150,000 and your net worth is $80,000. JOBS Act crowdfunding rules allow you to invest the greater of $2,200—or 5% of $80,000 ($4,000)—during a 12-month period.﻿﻿ So in this case, you can invest $4,000 over a 12-month period.
What Is the 2011 U.S. Debt Ceiling Crisis?  

The 2011 U.S. Debt Ceiling Crisis was a contentious debate in Congress that occurred in July 2011 regarding the maximum amount of debt the federal government should be allowed.





Key Takeaways

The 2011 U.S. Debt Ceiling Crisis was one of a series of recurrent debates over increasing the total size of the U.S. national debt.In 2008, the federal budget deficit stood at $458.6 billon, which widened to $1.4 trillion the following year as the government spent heavily to boost the economy.To resolve the crisis, Congress passed a law that increased the debt ceiling by $2.4 trillion.As a result of the crisis, the United States' credit rating was reduced from AAA to AA+ by Standard & Poor's.The 2011 debt ceiling crisis had implications to future debt ceiling discussions.


   Understanding the 2011 U.S. Debt Ceiling Crisis  

The federal government has rarely achieved a balanced budget, and its budget deficit ballooned following the 2007-08 Financial Crisis. In the 2008 fiscal year, the deficit stood at $458.6 billon, widening to $1.4 trillion in 2009 as the government engaged in a massive fiscal policy response to the economic downturn.



Between 2008 and 2010, Congress raised the debt ceiling from $10.6 trillion to $14.3 trillion. In 2011, as the economy showed early signs of recovery and federal debt approached its limit once again, negotiations began in Congress to balance spending priorities against the ever-rising debt burden. 



Heated debate ensued, pitting proponents of spending and debt against fiscal conservatives. Pro-debt politicians argued that failing to raise the limit would require immediate cuts to spending already authorized by Congress, which could result in late, partial, or missed payments to Social Security and Medicare recipients, government employees, and government contractors.



Moreover, they asserted the Treasury could suspend interest payments on existing debt rather than withhold funds committed to federal programs. The prospect of cutting back on already promised spending was labeled a crisis by debt proponents.



On the other hand, the specter of a technical default on existing Treasury debt roiled financial markets. Fiscal conservatives argued that any debt limit increase should come with constraints on the growth of federal spending and debt accumulation.






The U.S. has raised the debt limit 79 times since 1960. Most recently, it raised the debt limit in 2023.


   Outcome of the 2011 U.S. Debt Ceiling Crisis  

Congress resolved the debt ceiling crisis by passing the Budget Control Act of 2011, which became law on August 2, 2011. This act allowed the debt ceiling to be raised by $2.4 trillion in two phases, or installments.



In the first phase, a $400 billion increase would occur immediately, followed by another $500 billion unless Congress disapproved it. The second phase allowed for an increase between $1.2 trillion and $1.5 trillion, subject to Congressional disapproval as well. In return, the act included $900 billion in slowdowns in planned spending increases over a 10-year period. It also established a special committee charged with finding at least $1.5 trillion in additional savings.



In effect, the legislation incrementally raised the debt ceiling from $14.3 trillion to $16.4 trillion by January 27, 2012.



Following the passage of the act, Standard & Poor's took the radical step of downgrading the United States long-term credit rating from AAA to AA+, even though the U.S. did not default. The report says, "The downgrade reflects our opinion that the fiscal consolidation plan that Congress and the Administration recently agreed to falls short of what, in our view, would be necessary to stabilize the government's medium-term debt dynamics." The credit rating agency cited the unimpressive size of deficit reduction plans relative to the likely future prospects for politically driven spending and debt accumulation.


   Debt Approval Process Leading to the 2011 U.S. Debt Ceiling Crisis  

The U.S. Constitution gives Congress the power to borrow money. Before 1917, this power was exercised by Congress authorizing the Treasury to borrow specified amounts of debt to fund limited expenses, such as war-time military spending, which would be repaid after the end of hostilities. This kept the national debt directly linked to authorized spending.



In 1917, Congress imposed a limit on federal debt as well as individual issuance limits. In 1939, Congress gave the Treasury more flexibility in how it managed the overall structure of federal debt, giving it an aggregate limit. However, by delegating debt management authority to the Treasury, Congress was able to break the direct connection between authorized spending and the debt that finances it. 



While allowing greater flexibility to raise spending, this practice also created a need for Congress to repeatedly raise the debt limit when spending threatens to overrun available credit. Due to occasional political resistance to the idea of continually expanding the federal debt, this process of raising the debt limit has at times engendered controversy, which occurred during the 2011 Debt Ceiling Crisis.


   Longer-Term Implications of 2011 Debt Ceiling Crisis  

The American economy, politics, and financial markets were all affected in the long run by the country's 2011 debt limit issue. As mentioned before, Standard & Poor's downgraded the United States' credit rating for the first time ever (from AAA to AA+). This resulted in several longer-term implications.



First, the protracted debt ceiling talks and brinkmanship had an adverse effect on consumer and corporate confidence. On August 8, 2011, the S&P 500 dropped 79.2 points while the NASDAQ dropped 174.72 points. Each of those two indexes lost over 6.6% of its value that day, with the Dow Jones dropping 634 points, or 5.55%.



Concerns about the long-term viability of U.S. government debt were raised as a result of the debt limit crisis's failure to address the underlying fiscal issues. The nation's fiscal stability and long-term economic prospects may be impacted by the unsolved concerns around budget deficits and the national debt. Most recently, the U.S. Senate has increased the debt ceiling limit to $31.4 trillion.



The debt limit issue and the ensuing credit rating cut had some effect on the dollar. Even while there may not have been much of an immediate impact, it prompted concerns about the strength and stability of the US dollar in the long run. The debt limit debate also sparked talks about possible adjustments to both the budgetary procedures and the debt ceiling mechanism. There have been measures taken to prevent similar crises in the future, such as changes to the budgeting schedule and discussions about prospective changes to the debt cap structure.




What Could Happen if Congress Does Not Vote to Raise the Debt Ceiling?
According to Janet Yellen, failure to meet the government's obligations would cause irreparable harm to the U.S. economy, the livelihood of all Americans, and global financial stability. She also mentioned that the U.S. would risk facing another credit rating downgrade, similar to that of 2011.




Once the Debt Ceiling Is Reached, What Spending Will Be Cut?
In a letter to the U.S. House of Representatives, U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen warned congressional leaders that the Treasury will implement extraordinary measures to prevent the U.S. from defaulting on its obligations. In the past, the Treasury has suspended new investments of the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund and the Postal Service Retiree Health Benefits Fund. It also suspend reinvestment of the Government Securities Investment Fund of the Federal Employees Retirement System Thrift Savings Plan. Keep in mind that every debt ceiling debate cycle is unique and may be resolved using unique measures.




Why Did Increasing the Debt Ceiling Cause Contentious Debate in 2011?
Between 2008 and 2010, Congress raised the debt ceiling from $10.6 trillion to $14.3 trillion. In 2011, as the economy showed early signs of recovery and federal debt approached its limit again, negotiations began in Congress to decide spending priorities.  Heated debate ensued between pro-debt politicians and fiscal conservatives. Pro-debt politicians argued that failing to raise the limit could result in late, partial, or missed payments to Social Security and Medicare recipients, government employees, and government contractors. Fiscal conservatives argued that any debt limit increase should come with limits on federal spending and debt accumulation.


   The Bottom Line  

Following the 2007-08 Financial Crisis, in an effort to slow down the severe recession as well as the persistently high unemployment rate, the government increased federal spending. As a result, the federal debt reached its limit on multiple occasions from 2008 to 2011 which led to a series of increases of the debt limit. In 2011, the Treasury asked for its borrowing capacity to be extended.



The 2011 U.S. Debt Ceiling Crisis was a contentious debate in Congress that occurred in July 2011 regarding the maximum amount of debt the federal government should be allowed. Congress resolved the debt ceiling crisis by passing the Budget Control Act of 2011, which became law on August 2, 2011. This act allowed the debt ceiling to be raised by $2.4 trillion in two phases, or installments.
What Is the 25% Rule?  

There are two common usages of the term "25% rule":



The 25% rule is the concept that a local government's long-term debt should not exceed 25% of its annual budget. Any debt beyond this threshold is considered excessive and poses a potential risk, as the municipality may have trouble servicing the debt.
The 25% rule also refers to a technique for determining royalties, which stipulates that a party selling a product or service based on another party's intellectual property must pay that party a royalty of 25% of the gross profit made from the sale, before taxes. The 25% rule also commonly applies to trademarks, copyrights, patents, and other forms of intellectual property.





Key Takeaways

The 25% rule is a heuristic that can refer to either public finance or intellectual property law. In public finance, the 25% rule prescribes that a public entity’s total debt should not exceed one-quarter of its annual budget.In intellectual property, the 25% rule suggests the reasonable royalty that a license should pay an intellectual property holder on profits.


   Understanding the 25% Rule  

In both uses of the term, the 25% rule is more a matter of customary practice or heuristic (i.e., a rule of thumb), rather than an absolute or optimal threshold, or a strict legal requirement.



In the public finance setting, the 25% rule is a rough guideline for fiscal planning based on the confidence of bondholders and credit rating agencies. In the intellectual property arena, the 25% rule evolved from the customary rates negotiated between intellectual property holders and licensees.


   25% Rule for Municipal Debt  

Local or state governments looking to fund projects through municipal bond issues have to make assumptions about the revenues they expect to bring in, often through taxation or projects like toll roads, which in turn will allow them to support bond payments. If revenue falls short of expectations, those municipalities may not be able to make bond payments, which can cause them to default on their obligations and hurt their credit rating.



Municipal bondholders want to make sure that the issuing authority has the capacity to pay, which can be jeopardized by getting too deep in debt. Bondholders are thus cautious about purchasing bonds from local or state governments that are in violation of the 25% rule.



Tax-exempt private activity bonds—bonds issued by municipalities on behalf of private or non-profit organizations—also have a 25% rule applied to the proceeds from the bonds. This rule states that no more than 25% of bond proceeds may be used for land acquisition.


   25% Rule for Intellectual Property  

Patent or trademark owners use the 25% rule as a yardstick for defining a reasonable amount of royalty payments. The rule assumes that a licensee should retain at most 75% of the profits of a patented product given that s/he took on the bulk of the risks of developing the product and bringing the intellectual property to the market. The patent owner takes the remainder as a license royalty.



Setting the value of intellectual property is a complex matter. Although royalties are typically assessed against revenues, the 25% rule applies to profits. Furthermore, the 25% rule does not closely define what "gross profit" includes, which creates ambiguity in the valuation calculation. Because it's a simple rule, it does not take into account the costs associated with marketing the product. For example, the holder of a copyright will receive a 25% royalty, though the party doing the selling usually incurs the cost of attracting demand in the market through advertising.



In the 2011 court case of Uniloc USA, Inc. v. Microsoft Corp, the court of appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled that the 25 percent rule may not be used as a starting point for a patent damage analysis bound for the courtroom. The appeals court concluded that the rule does not rise to an admissible level of evidence and may not be relied upon in a patent lawsuit in federal court. While the 25% rule may still be used by other parties in estimating a proposed patent royalty, it should not be considered a legal mandate.
A 3-2-1 buydown mortgage is a type of home loan that can help would-be homebuyers achieve their goal of homeownership when high mortgage rates threaten to price them out of the market. The loan interest rate is reduced for the first three years of the loan term. In the fourth year, the original rate is applied and remains for the life of the mortgage.



Read on to learn how a 3-2-1 buydown mortgage works and whether one may be right for your needs.





Key Takeaways

With a 3-2-1 buydown mortgage, the borrower pays a lower than normal interest rate over the first three years of the loan.The loan interest rate is reduced by 3% in the first year, 2% in the second year, and 1% in the third year; for example, a 5% mortgage would be just 2% in year one.After the buydown period ends, the lender charges the full interest rate for the remainder of the mortgage term.Buydowns are often used by sellers, including home builders, to help buyers afford a property.


   How 3-2-1 Buydown Mortgages Work  

A buydown is a mortgage-financing technique that allows a homebuyer to obtain a lower interest rate for at least the first few years of the loan, or possibly its entire life. It is similar to the practice of buying discount points on a mortgage in return for a lower interest rate, except that it is a temporary.



Typically, the seller or homebuilder (sometimes even the mortgage lender) covers the cost of the 3-2-1 buydown. The cost equates to the savings to the buyer in the first three years.



In general, 3-2-1 buydown loans are available only for primary and secondary homes, not for investment properties. The 3-2-1 buydown is also not available as part of an adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM) with an initial period of fewer than five years.



The interest rate for a 3-2-1 buydown mortgage is reduced by 3% for the first year, 2% for the second year, and 1% for the third year. The original interest rate then kicks in for the remaining term of the loan. By contrast, with a 2-1 buydown, the rate is reduced by 2% for the first year, 1% for the second year, and then rises to the original rate when the buydown period ends.


   Pros and Cons of a 3-2-1 Buydown Mortgage  
  Pros  

A 3-2-1 buydown mortgage can be an attractive option for homebuyers when mortgage rates are high enough to discourage a home purchase.
They give home sellers a way to entice buyers in challenging housing markets.
Buydown loans can be advantageous for borrowers who may not have the needed funds today but expect to have higher incomes in future years.
Over the first three years of lower monthly payments, borrowers can set aside cash for other expenses, such as home repairs or remodeling.
When the loan finally resets to its permanent interest rate, borrowers have the certainty of knowing what their payments will be for years to come, which can be useful for budgeting.
A fixed-rate 3-2-1 buydown mortgage is less risky than an ARM or a variable-rate mortgage, where rising interest rates could mean higher monthly payments in the future.


  Cons  

A potential downside of a 3-2-1 buydown mortgage is that it may lull the borrower into buying a more expensive home than they can afford.The lower monthly costs are temporary and homebuyers must be prepared for a jump in payments.Borrowers who assume that their income will rise enough to afford future payments could find themselves in financial trouble if this fails to occur.






A temporary interest rate buydown is an alternative to price cuts for sellers and homebuilders. They're typically offered when mortgage interest rates have risen to levels that affect the affordability of home purchases.


   Who Subsidizes 3-2-1 Buydown Mortgages?  

The savings experienced by the homebuyer in the first three years of a buydown mortgage term represent the cost of a 3-2-1 buydown mortgage. Typically, the cost is covered by someone other than the buyer—the seller, homebuilder, or even the lender. For example, motivated sellers might be willing to pay the cost in order to attract buyers and close the deal.



In some circumstances, a company that's moving an employee to a new city might cover the buydown cost to ease the expense of relocation. More commonly, real estate developers will offer buydowns as incentives to potential buyers of newly built homes.


   Is a 3-2-1 Buydown Mortgage Right for You?  

As mentioned, it can be risky to get a 3-2-1 buydown mortgage on the assumption that your income will rise sufficiently over the next three years so that you’ll be able to afford the mortgage payments when they reach their maximum level.



For that reason, you must consider how secure your job is and whether unforeseen circumstances could make your house payments unmanageable once you reach the fourth year.



In addition, if by some chance you have to pay for the buydown on your own, then the key question to ask yourself is whether paying the cash up front is worth the several years of lower payments that you’ll receive in return.



For example, you might have other uses for that money, such as investing it or using it to pay off other debts with higher interest rates (like credit cards or car loans). If you have the cash to spare and don’t need it for anything else, then a 3-2-1 buydown mortgage could make sense.



The question is easier to answer when another party foots the bill for the buydown. But even then, ask yourself whether the maximum monthly payments will be affordable. Could the enticingly low initial rates lead you to want a more expensive home and to take on a larger mortgage than makes sense financially? You’ll also want to make sure that the home is fairly priced in the first place and that the seller isn’t padding the price to cover the buydown costs.




What Does a 3-2-1 Buydown Mortgage Cost?
The cost of a 3-2-1 buydown mortgage is the total amount that the buyer saves over the three-year period of lower rates.




Who Pays for a 3-2-1 Buydown Mortgage?
Usually the seller, homebuilder, or lender pays the cost of a buydown mortgage. Employers will sometimes pay for a buydown if they are relocating an employee to another area and want to ease the financial burden. Sometimes, the buyer/borrower may pay it.




Is a 3-2-1 Buydown Mortgage a Good Deal?
A 3-2-1 buydown mortgage can be a good deal for the homebuyer, particularly if someone else, such as the seller, is paying for it. However, buyers need to be reasonably certain that they’ll be able to afford their mortgage payments once the full interest rate applies from the fourth year onward. Otherwise, they could find themselves stretched too thin—and, in a worst-case scenario, lose their homes.


   The Bottom Line  

A 3-2-1 buydown mortgage offers homebuyers a financing option that can get them into a home despite a high interest rate environment. It offers them a way to save money on monthly loan payments in the first three years of the loan. However, borrowers must understand that their monthly payments will increase in the fourth year of the loan to the original interest rate and remain at that level for the life of the mortgage.
What Is the 3-6-3 Rule?  

The 3-6-3 rule is a slang term that refers to an unofficial practice in the banking industry in the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s that was the result of non-competitive and simplistic conditions in the industry.



The 3-6-3 rule describes how bankers would supposedly give 3% interest on their depositors' accounts, lend the depositors money at 6% interest, and then be playing golf by 3 p.m. In the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s, a huge part of a bank's business was lending out money at a higher interest rate than what it was paying out to its depositors (as a result of tighter regulations during this time period). The difference between what a bank earns on interest-accruing endeavors and what it pays out in interest-bearing accounts is known as the net interest rate spread.





Key Takeaways

The 3-6-3 rule is a slang term from the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s, which involved paying depositors 3% interest on account, lending money at 6% interest, and the ability to be playing golf by 3 p.m.The 3-6-3 rule describes the structure behind paying account holders a lower interest rate on deposits and changing a higher rate when loaning out the moneyThe net interest rate spread is the difference between the rates a bank pays customers and what it receives in income-generating activitiesThe government implemented tighter banking regulations after the Great Depression controlling the rate banks could lend money and reducing bank-to-bank competitionLooser regulation after the 1970s allowed banks to operate in a more competitive and complex fashion and provide additional services to customers


   Understanding the 3-6-3 Rule  

After the Great Depression, the government implemented tighter banking regulations. This was partially due to the problems–namely corruption and a lack of regulation–that the banking industry faced leading up the economic downturn that precipitated the Great Depression. One result of these regulations is that it controlled the rates at which banks could lend and borrow money. This made it difficult for banks to compete with each other and limited the scope of the services they could provide clients. As a whole, the banking industry became more stagnant.



With the loosening of banking regulations and the widespread adoption of information technology in the decades after the 1970s, banks now operate in a much more competitive and complex manner. For example, banks may now provide a greater range of services, including retail and commercial banking services, investment management, and wealth management.


   Types of Banking Services  

For banks that provide retail banking services, individual customers often use local branches of much larger commercial banks. Retail banks will generally offer savings and checking accounts, mortgages, personal loans, debit/credit cards, and certificates of deposit (CDs) to their clients. In retail banking, the focus is on the individual consumer (as opposed to any larger-sized clients, such as an endowment).



Banks that provide investment management for their clientele typically manage collective investments (such as pension funds) as well as oversee the assets of individual customers. Banks that work with collective assets may also offer a wide range of traditional and alternative products that may not be available to the average retail investor, such as IPO opportunities and hedge funds.



For banks that offer wealth management services, they may cater to both high-net-worth and ultra-high-net-worth individuals. The financial advisors at these banks typically work with clients to develop tailored financial solutions to meet their needs. Financial advisors may also provide specialized services, such as investment management, income tax preparation, and estate planning. Most financial advisors aim to attain the Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA) designation, which measures their competency and integrity in the field of investment management.




Does the 3-6-3 Rule Still Apply?
The 3-6-3 rule was a slang term for banking conditions in the 1950s, 60s, and 70s when government regulations were stricter and bank lending practices were more uniform. The term suggested banks paid account holders 3% interest, loaned out money at 6% interest, and were done with their work day and playing golf by 3 p.m. Looser regulations in the 1970s changed this. 




Why Is the 3-6-3 Rule No Longer True?
When banking regulations changed in the 1970s, banks were allowed to operate in a more competitive manner, generating a different profit structure than the 3-6-3 rule would have allowed.




What Does the Expression Banker's Hours Mean?
Banker's hours as an expression means a shorter work day than what most businesses have, which was once 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. By comparison, bankers were said to work between 10 a.m. and 3 p.m., the hours that banks used to be open.


   The Bottom Line  

The 3-6-3 rule is an outdated slang term from the 1950s through the 1970s that referred to the perception that banking at the time consisted of paying account holders 3%, charging 6% when lending money, and calling it a day and leaving by 3 p.m. when banks used to close. The term became less relevant after regulations changed in the 1970s and banks became more competitive with each other and offered a greater variety of rates.
A 3/27 adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM) is a 30-year loan that carries a fixed interest rate for the first three years, then a variable rate for the remaining 27 years. Borrowers often use a 3/27 ARM as a short-term financing vehicle that they can later refinance into a mortgage with more favorable terms.





Key Takeaways

A 3/27 adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM) is a 30-year mortgage with a three-year fixed interest rate period.The fixed interest rate is generally lower than the current rates on 30-year conventional mortgages.After three years, and for the remaining 27 years of the loan, the interest rate will float based on an index, such as the yield on one-year U.S. Treasury bills.Because their monthly payments can rise significantly once the interest rate adjusts, borrowers should plan carefully before taking out a 3/27 ARM to make sure it will still be affordable.


   How a 3/27 ARM Works  

Adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs) are a type of home loan in which the interest rate applied to the outstanding balance varies throughout the life of the loan. With an ARM, the initial interest rate is fixed for a period of time. After that, the rate resets periodically, at yearly, semiannual, or even monthly intervals.



ARMs differ from fixed-rate mortgages, the other primary mortgage type, which charge a set rate of interest that remains the same for the entirety of the loan.



3/27 ARMs are a kind of hybrid. For the first three years, they have a fixed interest rate, which is generally lower than the current rates on 30-year conventional mortgages. But after that, and for the remaining 27 years of the loan, their interest rate will fluctuate based on a benchmark index, such as the yield on one-year U.S. Treasury bills.



The lender also adds a margin on top of the index to set the interest rate that the borrower will actually pay. The total is known as the fully indexed interest rate. This rate is often substantially higher than the initial three-year fixed interest rate, although 3/27 ARMs usually have caps on how quickly they can increase.



Typically, the interest rate on a 3/27 ARM won’t increase more than 2% per adjustment period, which can occur every six or 12 months. That means the rate can increase by two full percentage points (not 2% of the current interest rate). So, for example, the rate might go from 4% to 6% in a single adjustment period.



There might also be a life-of-the-loan cap set at 5% or more. In that case, the interest rate on a mortgage that started at 4% might go no higher than 9%, regardless of what happens with the index on which it is based.


   3/27 ARM Example  

Say a borrower takes out a $250,000 3/27 ARM at an initial fixed rate of 3.5%. For the first three years, their monthly mortgage payment will be $1,123.



Then let’s assume that after three years, the benchmark interest rate is 3% and the bank’s margin is 2.5%. That adds up to a fully indexed rate of 5.5%.



If the borrower still has the 3/27 ARM and hasn’t refinanced into a different mortgage, their monthly payment will now be $1,483, an increase of $360.






To avoid payment shock when the interest rate begins to adjust, borrowers with 3/27 ARMs should aim to refinance the mortgage within the first three years.


   Risks of a 3/27 ARM  

The most serious risks for borrowers with a 3/27 mortgage are that they won’t be able to refinance their loan before the adjustable rate kicks in and that interest rates will have shot up in the meantime. That could happen if their credit score is too low, if their home has fallen in value, or simply if market forces have caused interest rates to rise across the board.



In that event, they would be stuck with the adjustable rate, which could mean considerably higher monthly payments, as in the example above.


   ARM Prepayment Penalties  

Borrowers should also be aware that ARMs, including 3/27 mortgages, may carry prepayment penalties, which can make refinancing costly and defeat the purpose of taking out an ARM with the intention of switching to a different loan in a few years.



The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) suggests that borrowers check the lender’s Truth in Lending Act disclosure for any prepayment penalties before they sign a contract.



“Remember, many aspects of the loan are negotiable,” the CFPB notes. “Ask for a loan that does not have a prepayment penalty if that is important to you. If you don’t like the terms of a loan and the lender won’t negotiate, you can always shop around for a different lender with terms that better suit your needs.”


   Is a 3/27 ARM a Good Investment?  

A 3/27 ARM could be a good choice for you if you’re looking for a loan with relatively low monthly payments for the first several years. That could make buying a home more affordable if your budget is already stretched or could give you some extra cash to spend on home repairs, furnishings, or other purposes, compared with a more expensive loan.



However, you’ll want to be reasonably certain that you’ll be in a good position to refinance by the end of the initial three-year period. That means, for example, that you’ll have a strong credit score and a reliable source of income at that point.



A 3/27 ARM is not a good idea if there’s a strong possibility that you won’t be able to refinance (or sell the home) during those first three years and the new, adjustable-rate payments would be too much for you.


  FAQs  


What is a 3/27 adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM)?
A 3/27 adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM) charges a fixed interest rate for the first three years, followed by a variable interest rate for the remaining 27 years. Because it combines the features of a fixed-rate mortgage and an adjustable-rate mortgage, it is sometimes referred to as a hybrid ARM.




What are the advantages of a 3/27 ARM?
A 3/27 ARM is likely to have a low interest rate for the first three years. But that rate can rise substantially starting in the fourth year.




Is a 3/27 ARM right for me?
If you plan to sell the home or refinance it within the first three years, then a 3/27 ARM might make sense for you. However, look for a 3/27 ARM without any prepayment penalties. Otherwise, a prepayment penalty could make it very costly to get out of the mortgage.
3C1 refers to a portion of the Investment Company Act of 1940 that allows private investment companies to be considered exceptions to certain regulations and reporting requirements stipulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). However, these firms must satisfy specific requirements to maintain their exception status.





Key Takeaways

3C1 refers to a portion of the Investment Company Act of 1940 that exempts certain private investment companies from regulations.A firm that's defined as an investment company must meet specific regulatory and reporting requirements stipulated by the SEC.3C1 allows private funds with 100 or fewer investors and no plans for an initial public offering to sidestep certain SEC requirements.


   Understanding 3C1  

3C1 is shorthand for the 3(c)(1) exemption found in section 3 of the Act. To fully understand section 3C1, we must first review the Act's definition of an investment company and how it relates to earlier sections of the Act: 3(b)(1) and 3(c). An investment company, as defined by the Investment Company Act, are companies that primarily engage in the business of investing, reinvesting, or trading securities. If companies are considered investment companies, they must adhere to certain regulations and reporting requirements.


  3(b)(1)  

3(b)(1) was established to exclude certain companies from being considered an investment company and having to adhere to the subsequent regulations. Companies are exempt as long as they are not primarily in the business of investing, reinvesting, holding, owning, or trading in securities themselves, or through subsidiaries, or controlled companies.


  3(c)  

3(c) takes it a step further and outlines specific exceptions to the classification of an investment company, which include broker-dealers, pension plans, church plans, and charitable organizations.


  3(c)(1)  

3(c)(1) adds to the exceptions list in 3(c) citing certain parameters or requirements that, if satisfied, would allow private investment companies to not be classified as investment companies under the Act.



3(c)(1) exempts the following from definition of investment company:



"Any issuer whose outstanding securities (other than short-term paper) are beneficially owned by not more than one hundred persons (or in the case of a qualifying venture capital fund, 250 persons) and that is not making and does not presently propose to make a public offering of such securities."



In other words, 3C1 allows private funds with 100 or fewer investors (and venture capital funds with fewer than 250 investors) and no plans for an initial public offering to sidestep SEC registration and other requirements, including ongoing disclosure and restrictions on derivatives trading. 3C1 funds are also referred to as 3C1 companies or 3(c)(1) funds.



The result of 3C1 is that it allows hedge fund companies to avoid the SEC scrutiny that other investment funds, such as mutual funds, must adhere to under the Act. However, the investors in 3C1 funds must be accredited investors, meaning investors who have an annual income of over $200,000 or a net worth in excess of $1 million.


   3C1 Funds vs. 3C7 Funds  

Private equity funds are usually structured as 3C1 funds or 3C7 funds, the latter being a reference to the 3(c)(7) exemption. Both 3C1 and 3C7 funds are exempt from SEC registration requirements under the Investment Company Act of 1940, but the nature of the exemption is slightly different. Whereas the 3C1 exemption hinges on not exceeding 100 accredited investors, a 3C7 fund must maintain a total of 2,000 or fewer qualified purchasers. However, qualified purchasers must clear a higher bar and have over $5 million in assets, but a 3C7 fund is permitted to have more of these people or entities participating as investors.


   3C1 Compliance Challenges  

Although 100 accredited investors sound like an easy limit to monitor, it can be a challenging area for fund compliance. Private funds are generally protected in the case of involuntary share transfers. For example, the death of an investor results in shares being split up among family members would be considered an involuntary transfer.



However, these funds can run into issues with shares given as employment incentives. Knowledgeable employees, including executives, directors, and partners, do not count against the fund's tally. However, employees who leave the firm carrying the shares with them will count against the 100 investor limit. The one hundred person limit is so critical to the investment company exemption and 3C1 status, that private funds put a great deal of effort into making certain they are in compliance.
What Is the 3(c)(7) Exemption?  

The 3(c)(7) exemption refers to a portion of the Investment Company Act of 1940 that allows private investment companies an exemption from some Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regulation, providing that they meet certain criteria. 3C7 is shorthand for the 3(c)(7) exemption.





Key Takeaways

The 3(c)(7) exemption refers to the Investment Company Act of 1940's section permitting qualifying private funds an exemption from certain SEC regulations.Private funds must not plan to issue an IPO and their investors must be qualified purchases to qualify for the 3C7 exemption.There is no maximum limit for the number of purchasers of 3C7 funds.In contrast to 3C7, 3C1 funds deal with no more than 100 accredited investors.


   Understanding the 3(c)(7) Exemption  

The exemption, found in section three of the act, reads in part: 



Section 3(3)(c) Notwithstanding subsection (a), none of the following persons is an investment company within the meaning of this title:(7)(A) Any issuer, the outstanding securities of which are owned exclusively by persons who, at the time of acquisition of such securities, are qualified purchasers, and which is not making and does not at that time propose to make a public offering of such securities.﻿﻿



To qualify for the 3C7 exemption, the private investment company must show that they have no plans of making an initial public offering (IPO) and that their investors are qualified purchasers. A qualified purchaser is a higher standard than an accredited investor; it requires that the investor owns not less than $5 million in investments. The term “qualified purchaser” is defined in Section 2(a)(51) of the Investment Company Act.﻿﻿



3C7 funds are not required to go through Securities and Exchange Commission registration or provide ongoing disclosure. They are also exempt from issuing a prospectus that would outline investment positions publicly. 3C7 funds are also referred to as 3C7 companies or 3(c)(7) funds.﻿﻿ ﻿﻿ 



The Investment Company Act of 1940 defines an “investment company” as an issuer that “holds itself out as being engaged primarily or proposes to engage primarily, in the business of investing, reinvesting or trading in securities.” 3C7 is one of two exemptions in the Investment Company Act of 1940 that hedge funds, venture capital funds, and other private equity funds use to avoid SEC restrictions.



This frees up these funds to use tools like leverage and derivatives to an extent that most publicly traded funds cannot. The vast majority of new hedge funds, private equity funds, venture capital funds, and other private investment vehicles are organized so as to fall outside the purview of the Investment Company Act of 1940.



That said, 3C7 funds must maintain their compliance to continue utilizing this exemption from the 1940 Act.﻿﻿ If a fund were to fall out of compliance by taking in investments from non-qualified purchasers, for example, it would open itself to SEC enforcement actions as well as litigation from its investors and any other parties it has contracts with. 


   3C7 Funds vs. 3C1 Funds  

Both 3C7 and 3C1 funds are exempted from the requirements imposed on “investment companies” under the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the “Act”). However, there are important differences between them. 3C7 funds, as noted, take investments from qualified purchasers, whereas 3C1 funds work with accredited investors.



Investors in 3C7 funds are held to a higher wealth measure than those in 3C1 funds, which can limit the investor pool that a fund is hoping to raise money from. That said, 3C1 funds are capped at 100 investors total, limiting the number of investors the fund can take in from the wider pool they are allowed to pull from.



3C7 funds don't have a set cap. However, 3C7 funds will fall under the regulation that is stipulated in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 when they reach 2,000 investors. At this point, private funds are subject to increased SEC scrutiny and have more in common with public companies.
What Is 3D Printing?  

Three-dimensional (3D) printing is an additive manufacturing process that creates a physical object from a digital design. The process works by laying down thin layers of material in the form of liquid or powdered plastic, metal or cement, and then fusing the layers together.





Key Takeaways

Three-dimensional (3D) printing is an additive manufacturing process in which a physical object is created from a digital design by printing thin layers of material and then fusing them together.Some industries, such as hearing aids manufacturers, airline manufacturers, and car manufacturers, use 3D printing to create prototypes and mass produce their products using custom scans.While it is currently too slow to be used in mass production, 3D printing technology is still evolving and has the potential to massively disrupt both the manufacturing logistics and inventory management industries.


   Understanding 3D Printing  

Since it was introduced, 3D printing technology has already increased manufacturing productivity. In the long-term, it has the potential to massively disrupt both the manufacturing, logistics, and inventory management industries, especially if it can be successfully incorporated into mass production processes.



Currently, 3D printing speeds are too slow to be used in mass production. However, the technology has been used to reduce the lead time in the development of prototypes of parts and devices, and the tooling needed to make them. This is hugely beneficial to small-scale manufacturers because it reduces their costs and the time to market, that is, the amount of time from a product being conceived until its being available for sale.



3D printing can create intricate and complex shapes using less material than subtractive manufacturing processes, such as drilling, welding, injection molding, and other processes. Making prototypes faster, easier, and cheaper allows for more innovation, experimentation, and product-based startups.


   Industrial Uses  

Car and aircraft manufacturers have taken the lead in 3D manufacturing, using the technology to transform unibody and fuselage design and production, and powertrain design and production. Boeing is using 3D-printed titanium parts in the construction of its 787 Dreamliner airliner. In 2017, General Electric created a helicopter engine with 16 parts instead of 900–an indication of how big an impact 3D printing could potentially have on supply chains.



In medical sciences, 3D printing is being used to customize implants. In the future, organs and body parts may be created using 3D printing techniques. In the fashion world, Nike, Adidas, and New Balance are using 3D printing to create their shoes. In the construction industry, companies around the world are making breakthroughs in 3D printing of the materials need to build homes. Using layers of concrete, homes can be built in 24 hours, which are stronger than regular cinder blocks and cost a fraction of the price.



In the manufacturing of hearing aids, 3D printing is now customary. The use of 3D printing accelerates the process of manufacturing and enables manufacturers to make custom hearing aids. Audiologists can use 3D scanners to create a custom prototype using reference points from the scan. Manufacturers can feed the scan into a 3D printing machine and after fine-tuning the materials and the ear shapes, print the entire hearing aids.
What Are 3P Oil Reserves?  

3P oil reserves are the total amount of reserves that a company estimates having access to, calculated as the sum of all proven and unproven reserves. The 3Ps stand for proven, probable, and possible reserves.



The oil industry breaks unproven reserves into two segments: those based on geological and engineering estimates from established sources (probable) and those that are less likely to be extracted due to financial or technical difficulties (possible). Therefore, 3P refers to proven plus probable plus possible reserves. This can be contrasted with 2P oil, which includes only proven and probable reserves.





Key Takeaways

3P oil reserves are the total amount of estimated reserves inclusive of all proven and unproven reserves that a company has access to.Each category of reserve used in the calculation has a probability assigned to it in terms of the viability of recovering crude oil.Most oil and gas companies provide rosy estimates of their 3P oil reserves; hence, investors rely on findings by independent consultants to assess their stock picks.


   Understanding 3P Oil Reserves  

The 3P estimate is an optimistic estimate of what might be pumped out of a well by an oil company. The three different categories of reserves also have different production probabilities assigned. For example, the oil industry gives proven reserves a 90% certainty of being produced (P90). The industry gives probable reserves a 50% certainty (P50), and possible reserves a 10% certainty (P10) of actually being produced.



Another way to think about the concept of different reserve categories is to use a fishing analogy where proven reserves are the equivalent of having caught and landed a fish. It is certain and in hand. Probable reserves are the equivalent of having a fish on the line. The fish is technically caught, but is not yet on land and may still come off the line and get away. Possible reserves are a bit like saying, "there are fish in this river somewhere." These reserves exist, but it is far from certain that an oil company will ever fully discover, develop, and produce them.



Energy companies update their investors on the amount of oil and natural gas reserves they have access to through an annual reserve update. This update typically includes proven, probable, and possible reserves, and is similar to an inventory report that a retailer might provide to investors.﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿



However, there is no legal obligation for companies to report their 3P reserves. In recent years, oil and gas startups and exploration companies have taken to reporting their 3P reserves. This is because the third "P" (i.e., possible reserves) can artificially inflate reserves figures and result in an acquisition by a bigger player. The cost benefits of investing in hiring a 3P reserve calculation versus putting money into a costly exploration operation works out in their favor.


   Independent Consultant Resource Assessment  

Several consulting firms provide oil companies with independent assessments of their oil reserves. These audits are also beneficial to investors who want the assurance that a company has the reserves they claim. One such firm is DeGolyer and MacNaughton and another is Miller and Lents, who have served the oil and gas industry with trusted upstream insights and reservoir evaluation for many years.﻿



Investors in oil and gas companies, as well as independent oil projects, rely on consulting firms like these to provide accurate and independent assessments of a company's full reserve base, including 3P reserves. Crucial information includes things like estimations of reserves and resources to be recovered from discoveries and verification of hydrocarbon and mineral reserves and resources.


   Rapid Classification Changes in Proven Reserves  

Understanding the natural resource extraction industry can be challenging because proven reserves are just one of three classifications. Most people assume proven oil and gas reserves should only go up when new exploratory wells are drilled, resulting in new reservoirs being discovered. In reality, there are often more significant gains and losses resulting from shifts between classifications than there are increases in proven reserves from truly new discoveries. For this reason, it is useful for investors to know a company’s proven, probable, and possible reserves rather than just the proven reserves.



If an investor does not have the data on probable reserves, proven reserves can suddenly change in a number of different situations. For example, if a company has a large amount of probable reserves and a relevant extraction technology improves, then those probable reserves are added to the proven reserves.
What Is the 30-Year Treasury?  

The 30-Year Treasury is a U.S. Treasury debt obligation that has a maturity of 30 years. The 30-year Treasury used to be the bellwether U.S. bond but now most consider the 10-year Treasury to be the benchmark.





Key Takeaways

30-year Treasuries are bonds issued by the U.S. government and have a maturity of 30 years.Other securities issued by the U.S. government include Treasury bills, notes, and Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS).30-year Treasuries pay interest semiannually until they mature and at maturity pay the face value of the bond.


   Understanding the 30-Year Treasury  

The U.S. government borrows money from investors by issuing debt securities through its Treasury department. Debt instruments that can be purchased from the government include Treasury bills (T-bills), notes, and Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS). T-bills are marketable securities issued for terms of less than a year, and Treasury notes are issued with maturities from two to 10 years.



TIPS are marketable securities whose principal is adjusted by changes in the Consumer Price Index (CPI). When there is inflation, the principal increases. When deflation sets in, the principal decreases. U.S. Treasury securities with longer-term maturities can be purchased as U.S. Savings bonds or Treasury bonds.


   Special Considerations  

Treasury bonds are long-term debt securities issued with a maturity of 20 years or 30 years from the issue date. These marketable securities pay interest semi-annually, or every six months until they mature. At maturity, the investor is paid the face value of the bond. The 30-year Treasury will generally pay a higher interest rate than shorter Treasuries to compensate for the additional risks inherent in the longer maturity. However, when compared to other bonds, Treasuries are relatively safe because they are backed by the U.S. government.



The price and interest rate of the 30-year Treasury bond is determined at an auction where it is set at either par, premium, or discount to par. If the yield to maturity (YTM) is greater than the interest rate, the price of the bond will be issued at a discount. If the YTM is equal to the interest rate, the price will be equal to par. Finally, if the YTM is less than the interest rate, the Treasury bond price will be sold at a premium to par. In a single auction, a bidder can buy up to $5 million in bonds by non-competitive bidding or up to 35% of the initial offering amount by competitive bidding. In addition, the bonds are sold in increments of $100 and the minimum purchase is $100.


   30-Year Treasury vs. Savings Bonds  

U.S. Savings bonds, specifically, Series EE Savings bonds, are non-marketable securities that earn interest for 30 years. Interest isn’t paid out periodically. Instead, interest accumulates, and the investor receives everything when they redeem the savings bond. The bond can be redeemed after one year, but if they are sold before five years from the purchase date, the investor will lose the last three months' interest. For example, an investor who sells the Savings bond after 24 months will only receive interest for 21 months.



Because the U.S. is seen as a very low-risk borrower, many investors see 30-year Treasury interest rates as indicative of the state of the wider bond market. Normally, the interest rate decreases with greater demand for 30-year Treasury securities and rises with lower demand. The S&P U.S. Treasury Bond Current 30-Year Index is a one-security index comprising the most recently issued 30-year U.S. Treasury bond. It is a market value-weighted index that seeks to measure the performance of the Treasury bond market.
What Is a 341 Meeting?  

The term “341 meeting” refers to a meeting between creditors and debtors that is required to take place during the course of a Chapter 7 bankruptcy proceeding. Accordingly, its name is derived from section 341 of the bankruptcy code.



A 341 meeting is typically scheduled roughly one month after a debtor files for bankruptcy. To be considered legally valid, the meeting must include both the individual filing for bankruptcy and the court-appointed bankruptcy trustee.





Key Takeaways

A 341 meeting is an important stage in the Chapter 7 bankruptcy process.It is intended to establish the facts of the bankruptcy in question and to facilitate the negotiation of a repayment plan between the debtor and their creditors.Generally, 341 meetings occur at the offices of the trustee, rather than in a courtroom.


   How 341 Meetings Work  

The 341 meeting is one of many stages involved in declaring bankruptcy in the United States. Its primary purpose is to establish the facts of the bankruptcy in question, and to ensure that all the paperwork necessary to carry out the bankruptcy proceedings are in order. Although the attorneys of the debtor and creditor are welcome to attend, the only parties whose presence at the 341 meeting is legally required are the debtor in question and the court-appointed trustee.



Prior to the 341 meeting, the trustee would have already reviewed the bankruptcy paperwork and financial records submitted by the debtor. The purpose of the 341 meeting, therefore, is principally for the trustee to confirm the facts stated by the debtor and to collect any additional paperwork that may be required. In the event that the debtor is attempting bankruptcy fraud, this would likely be detected by the trustee during or prior to the 341 meeting.



From the debtor’s perspective, the objective of the 341 meeting is to provide the necessary documents in order to prove that their identity is authentic, while also establishing their current assets, liabilities, income, expenses, and other relevant financial circumstances. If the creditors are in attendance, they will be able to ask clarifying questions, such as whether the debtor is entitled to any upcoming income sources, ie. tax rebates or inheritances, or whether the debtor owns undisclosed assets, such as shares in a private business or assets held overseas.






Typically, discussion at 341 meetings will center on how the debtor plans to eventually repay their obligations.


   Real World Example of a 341 Meeting  

Peter is a bankruptcy trustee currently presiding over a 341 meeting. The debtor present declared bankruptcy over a $5,000 debt, and has attended the meeting along with his bankruptcy lawyer. Likewise, the creditor and her lawyer are also present.



Peter’s first priority is to verify the identity and financial status of the debtor. Although Peter already reviewed many documents prior to the meeting, the 341 meeting provides an occasion to ask follow-up questions about the documents provided and to obtain any additional disclosures deemed necessary. In the unlikely event that the debtor were attempting bankruptcy fraud, this would also likely be detected due to discrepancies or inadequacies in the documents provided.



During the meeting, the lawyers for the debtor and creditor engaged in detailed conversation regarding the debtor’s assets, liabilities, and income sources; and were able to negotiate a general plan for the gradual repayment of the outstanding debt. As is the case with most 341 meetings, the meeting took place at Peter’s office, rather than in court before a judge.
What Is a 401(a) Plan?  

A 401(a) plan is an employer-sponsored money-purchase retirement plan that allows dollar or percentage-based contributions from the employer, the employee, or both. The sponsoring employer establishes eligibility and the vesting schedule. The employee can withdraw funds from a 401(a) plan through a rollover to a different qualified retirement plan, a lump-sum payment, or an annuity.





Key Takeaways

A 401(a) plan is employer-sponsored, and both the employer and employee can contribute.401(a) plans are usually used by government and non-profit organizations.401(a) plans give the employer a larger share of control over how the plan is invested.An employee can withdraw funds from a 401(a) plan through a rollover to a different qualified retirement plan, a lump-sum payment, or an annuity.Investments in 401(a) plans are low risk and typically include government bonds and funds focused on value-based stocks.


   Understanding a 401(a) Plan  

There are a variety of retirement plans that employers can offer their employees. Each comes with different stipulations, restrictions, and some are better suited for certain types of employers.



A 401(a) plan is a type of retirement plan made available to those working in government agencies, educational institutions, and non-profit organizations. Eligible employees who participate in the plan include government employees, teachers, administrators, and support staff. A 401(a) plan's features are similar to a 401(k) plan, which are more common in profit-based industries. 401(a) plans do not allow employees to contribute to 401(k) plans, however.



If an individual leaves an employer, they do have the option of transferring the funds in their 401(a) to a 401(k) plan or individual retirement account (IRA).



Employers can form multiple 401(a) plans, each with distinct eligibility criteria, contribution amounts, and vesting schedules. Employers use these plans to create incentive programs for employee retention. The employer controls the plan and determines the contribution limits.



To participate in a 401(a) plan, an individual must be 21 years of age and have been working in the job for a minimum of two years. These conditions are subject to vary.


   Contributions for a 401(a) Plan  

A 401(a) plan can have mandatory or voluntary contributions, and the employer decides if contributions are made on an after-tax or pre-tax basis. An employer contributes funds to the plan on an employee's behalf. Employer contribution options include the employer paying a set amount into an employee's plan, matching a fixed percentage of employee contributions, or matching employee contributions within a specific dollar range.



The majority of voluntary contributions to a 401(a) plan are capped at 25% of an employee's annual pay.


   Investments for a 401(a) Plan  

The plan gives employers more control over their employees' investment choices. Government employers with 401(a) plans often limit investment options to only the safest and most secure options to minimize risk. A 401(a) plan assures a certain level of retirement savings but requires due diligence by the employee to meet retirement goals.


   Vesting and Withdrawals for a 401(a) Plan  

Any 401(a) contributions an employee makes and any earnings on those contributions are immediately fully vested. Becoming fully vested in the employer contributions depends on the vesting schedule the employer sets up. Some employers, especially those who offer 401(k) plans, link vesting to years of service as an incentive for employees to stay with the company.



The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) subjects 401(a) withdrawals to income tax withholdings and a 10% early withdrawal penalty unless the employee is 59½, dies, is disabled, or rolls over the funds into a qualified IRA or retirement plan through a direct trustee-to-trustee transfer. 


   Qualifying for Tax Credits  

Employees who contribute to a 401(a) plan may qualify for a tax credit. Employees can have both a 401(a) plan and an IRA at the same time. However, if an employee has a 401(a) plan, the tax benefits for traditional IRA contributions may be phased out depending on the employee's adjusted gross income.


   401(a) vs. 401(k) Plans  

A 401(a) plan is similar to a 401(k), another type of employer-sponsored plan that provides a tax advantage for retirement investments. The main difference is who participates: while 401(k) plans are intended for private sector employees, 401(a) plans are directed towards employees of government bodies, educational institutions, and charitable organizations. These plans also tend to offer fewer, more conservative investment options than those found in a 401(k) plan.



If you work in the private sector, you can contribute to a 401(k) plan after one year. But if your employer offers a 401(a) plan, it takes two years.



There are also important rule differences between the two types of plans. With a 401(k) plan, participation is voluntary, and the employee can decide how much money to contribute towards the plan so long as it is below the legal limit. Employers may match a portion of the employee's contribution, but many do not.



But in a 401(a) plan, employers can make it mandatory for their employees to participate. But employers are also required to contribute to their employees' accounts. They can also decide whether the 401(a) plan is to be funded with pre-tax or after-tax dollars.




401(a) vs. 401(k) plans

   Tips for a 401(a) Plan  

As with other types of retirement plans, it is important to understand the rules and fees associated with a 401(a) before making a significant contribution. This caution can help reduce your costs and expenses further down the line.



Here are some ways to make the most out of a 401(a) or any other tax-advantaged retirement account:



Understand the Rules. As with other tax-advantaged retirement accounts, there are strict rules about what you can do with the money in a 401(a) account. If you take money out before you reach age 59½, you may face a 10% penalty, except for certain emergency expenses. It is important to understand the rules for holding and closing your account to avoid unexpected tax implications.Understand the fees. In addition to taxes, there are also fees associated with a 401(a) account that are used to offset the administrative costs of maintaining your investment account. High plan fees can easily eat into your portfolio gains, so it is important to talk to your employer and understand how much the plan will actually cost you. 




What Happens to My 401(a) Plan When I Quit?
The money in your 401(a) or other employer-sponsored retirement account belongs to you, even after you leave the employer. When you lose your job, that money can be taken as a distribution (with a possible early withdrawal penalty) or rolled into a different retirement account, such as an IRA.




What's the Difference Between a 401(a) and 403(b)?
A 401(a) plan and a 403(b) are both types of tax-advantaged retirement plans available to certain public-sector employees. Unlike a 401(a), a 403(b) plan is aimed at employees of public schools and tax-exempt organizations, and their investment options are limited to annuities or mutual funds. The main difference is that an employer can make participation in a 401(a) plan mandatory, while it remains voluntary for employees to participate in a 403(b).




How Much Can I Invest in a 401(a) Plan?
A 401(a) plan does not have the same investment limits as a 401(k) plan. Most plans cap voluntary contributions to 25% of the employee's take-home pay.


   The Bottom Line  

A 401(a) plan is a type of tax-advantaged account that allows public-sector employees to save for retirement. These plans typically offer fewer investment options than other types of plans, and they are also relatively low-risk. Although employers can make participation mandatory, there are may also be a tax credit for those who contribute to a 401(a).

   What Is a 401(k) Plan?  

A 401(k) plan is a retirement savings plan offered by many American employers that has tax advantages for the saver. It is named after a section of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code (IRC).



The employee who signs up for a 401(k) agrees to have a percentage of each paycheck paid directly into an investment account. The employer may match part or all of that contribution. The employee gets to choose among a number of investment options, usually mutual funds.





Key Takeaways

A 401(k) plan is a company-sponsored retirement account to which employees can contribute income, while employers may match contributions.There are two basic types of 401(k)s—traditional and Roth—which differ primarily in how they're taxed.With a traditional 401(k), employee contributions are pre-tax, meaning they reduce taxable income, but withdrawals are taxed.Employee contributions to Roth 401(k)s are made with after-tax income: There's no tax deduction in the contribution year, but withdrawals are tax-free.Employer contributions can be made to both traditional and Roth 401(k) plans.


   How 401(k) Plans Work  

The 401(k) plan was designed by the United States Congress to encourage Americans to save for retirement. Among the benefits they offer is tax savings.



There are two main options, each with distinct tax advantages.


  Traditional 401(k)  

With a traditional 401(k), employee contributions are deducted from gross income. This means the money comes from your paycheck before income taxes have been deducted. As a result, your taxable income is reduced by the total amount of contributions for the year and can be reported as a tax deduction for that tax year. No taxes are due on either the money contributed or the investment earnings until you withdraw the money, usually in retirement.


  Roth 401(k)  

With a Roth 401(k), contributions are deducted from your after-tax income. This means contributions come from your pay after income taxes have been deducted. As a result, there is no tax deduction in the year of the contribution. When you withdraw the money during retirement, though, you don't have to pay any additional taxes on your contribution or on the investment earnings.



Note: Even though contributions to a Roth 401(k) are made with after-tax money, generally, if withdrawals are made prior to the age of 59 1/2, it could trigger tax consequences. Always check with an accountant, or qualified financial advisor prior to withdrawing money from either a Roth or Traditional 401(k).



However, not all employers offer the option of a Roth account. If the Roth is offered, you can choose between a traditional and Roth 401(k). Or you can contribute to both up to the annual contribution limit.

   Contributing to a 401(k) Plan  

A 401(k) is a defined contribution plan. The employee and employer can make contributions to the account up to the dollar limits set by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).



A defined contribution plan is an alternative to the traditional pension, known as a defined-benefit plan. With a pension, the employer is committed to providing a specific amount of money to the employee for life during retirement.



In recent decades, 401(k) plans have become more common, and traditional pensions have become rare as employers have shifted the responsibility and risk of saving for retirement to their employees.



Employees also are responsible for choosing the specific investments within their 401(k) accounts from a selection that their employer offers. Those offerings typically include an assortment of stock and bond mutual funds and target-date funds designed to reduce the risk of investment losses as the employee approaches retirement.



They may also include guaranteed investment contracts (GICs) issued by insurance companies and sometimes the employer's own stock.


  Contribution Limits  

The maximum amount that an employee or employer can contribute to a 401(k) plan is adjusted periodically to account for inflation, which is a metric that measures rising prices in an economy.



For 2022, the annual limit on employee contributions was $20,500 per year for workers under age 50. However, those aged 50 and over could make a $6,500 catch-up contribution.



For 2023, the annual limit on employee contributions is $22,500 per year for workers under age 50. If you are age 50 or over, you can make an additional $7,500 catch-up contribution.



If your employer also contributes or if you elect to make additional, non-deductible after-tax contributions to your traditional 401(k) account, there is a total employee-and-employer contribution amount for the year:



2022

For workers under 50 years old, the total employee-employer contributions cannot exceed $66,000 per year.If the catch-up contribution for those 50 and over is included, the limit is $73,500.


  Employer Matching  

Employers who match employee contributions use various formulas to calculate that match.



For instance, an employer might match 50 cents for every dollar that the employee contributes, up to a certain percentage of salary.



Financial advisors often recommend that employees contribute at least enough money to their 401(k) plans to get the full employer match.


  Contributing to Both a Traditional and a Roth 401(k)  

If their employer offers both types of 401(k) plans, an employee can split their contributions, putting some money into a traditional 401(k) and some into a Roth 401(k).



However, their total contribution to the two types of accounts can't exceed the limit for one account (such as $20,500 for those under age 50 in 2022 or $22,500 in 2023).






Employer contributions can be made to a traditional 401(k) account and a Roth 401(k). Withdrawals from the former will be subject to tax, whereas qualifying withdrawals from the latter are tax-free.


   How Does a 401(k) Earn Money?  

Your contributions to your 401(k) account are invested according to the choices you make from the selection your employer offers. As noted above, these options typically include an assortment of stock and bond mutual funds and target-date funds designed to reduce the risk of investment losses as you get closer to retirement.



How much you contribute each year, whether or not your company matches your contributions, your investments and their returns, plus the number of years you have until retirement all contribute to how quickly and how much your money will grow.



Provided you don't remove funds from your account, you don't have to pay taxes on investment gains, interest, or dividends until you withdraw money from the account after retirement (unless you have a Roth 401(k), in which case you don't have to pay taxes on qualified withdrawals when you retire).



What's more, if you open a 401(k) when you are young, it has the potential to earn more money for you, thanks to the power of compounding. The benefit of compounding is that returns generated by savings can be reinvested back into the account and begin generating returns of their own.



Over a period of many years, the compounded earnings on your 401(k) account can actually be larger than the contributions you have made to the account. In this way, as you keep contributing to your 401(k), it has the potential to grow into a sizable chunk of money over time.


   Taking Withdrawals From a 401(k)  

Once money goes into a 401(k), it is difficult to withdraw it without paying taxes on the withdrawal amounts.



"Make sure that you still save enough on the outside for emergencies and expenses you may have before retirement," says Dan Stewart, CFA®, president of Revere Asset Management Inc., in Dallas. "Do not put all of your savings into your 401(k) where you cannot easily access it, if necessary."



The earnings in a 401(k) account are tax deferred in the case of traditional 401(k)s and tax free in the case of Roths. When the traditional 401(k) owner makes withdrawals, that money (which has never been taxed) will be taxed as ordinary income. Roth account owners have already paid income tax on the money they contributed to the plan and will owe no tax on their withdrawals as long as they satisfy certain requirements.



Both traditional and Roth 401(k) owners must be at least age 59½—or meet other criteria spelled out by the IRS, such as being totally and permanently disabled—when they start to make withdrawals to avoid a penalty.



This penalty is usually an additional 10% early distribution tax on top of any other tax they owe.



Some employers allow employees to take out a loan against their contributions to a 401(k) plan. The employee is essentially borrowing from themselves. If you take out a 401(k) loan and leave the job before the loan is repaid, you'll have to repay it in a lump sum or face the 10% penalty for an early withdrawal.


   Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs)  

Traditional 401(k) account holders are subject to required minimum distributions (RMDs) after reaching a certain age. (Withdrawals are often referred to as distributions in IRS parlance.)



Beginning on January 1, 2023, account owners who have retired must start taking RMDs from their 401(k) plans starting at age 73. This size of the RMD is calculated is based on your life expectancy at the time. Prior to 2020, the RMD age was 70½ years old. Before 2023, the RMD age was 72. It was updated to age 73 in the omnibus spending bill H.R. 2617 in 2022.  



Note that distributions from a traditional 401(k) are taxable. Qualified withdrawals from a Roth 401(k) are not.






Roth IRAs, unlike Roth 401(k)s, are not subject to RMDs during the owner's lifetime.


   Traditional 401(k) vs. Roth 401(k)  

When 401(k) plans became available in 1978, companies and their employees had just one choice: the traditional 401(k). Then in 2006, Roth 401(k)s arrived. Roths are named for former U.S. Senator William Roth of Delaware, the primary sponsor of the 1997 legislation that made the Roth IRA possible.



While Roth 401(k)s were a little slow to catch on, many employers now offer them. So the first decision employees often have to make is choosing between a Roth and a traditional (401(k).



As a general rule, employees who expect to be in a lower marginal tax bracket after they retire might want to opt for a traditional 401(k) and take advantage of the immediate tax break.



On the other hand, employees who expect to be in a higher bracket after retiring might opt for the Roth so that they can avoid taxes on their savings later. Also important—especially if the Roth has years to grow—is that, since there is no tax on withdrawals, all the money that the contributions earn over decades of being in the account is tax free.



As a practical matter, the Roth reduces your immediate spending power more than a traditional 401(k) plan. That matters if your budget is tight.



Since no one can predict what tax rates will be decades from now, neither type of 401(k) is a sure thing. For that reason, many financial advisors suggest that people hedge their bets, putting some of their money into each.


   When You Leave Your Job  

When you leave a company where you've been employed and you have a 401(k) plan, you generally have four options:


  1. Withdraw the Money  

Withdrawing the money is usually a bad idea unless you urgently need the cash. The money will be taxable in the year it's withdrawn. You will be hit with the additional 10% early distribution tax unless you are over 59½, permanently disabled, or meet the other IRS criteria for an exception to the rule.



In the case of a Roth 401(k), you can withdraw your contributions (but not any profits) tax free and without penalty at any time as long as you have had the account for at least five years. Remember, however, that you're still diminishing your retirement savings, which you may regret later.


  2. Roll Your 401(k) Into an IRA  

By moving the money into an IRA at a brokerage firm, a mutual fund company, or a bank, you can avoid immediate taxes and maintain the account's tax-advantaged status. What's more, you will be able to select from among a wider range of investment choices than with your employer's plan.



The IRS has relatively strict rules on rollovers and how they need to be accomplished, and running afoul of them is costly. Typically, the financial institution that is in line to receive the money will be more than happy to help with the process and prevent any missteps.






Funds withdrawn from your 401(k) must be rolled over to another retirement account within 60 days to avoid taxes and penalties.


  3. Leave Your 401(k) With the Old Employer  

In many cases, employers will permit a departing employee to keep a 401(k) account in their old plan indefinitely, though the employee can't make any further contributions to it. This generally applies to accounts worth at least $5,000. In the case of smaller accounts, the employer may give the employee no choice but to move the money elsewhere.



Leaving 401(k) money where it is can make sense if the old employer's plan is well managed and you are satisfied with the investment choices it offers. The danger is that employees who change jobs over the course of their careers can leave a trail of old 401(k) plans and may forget about one or more of them. Their heirs might also be unaware of the existence of the accounts.


  4. Move Your 401(k) to a New Employer  

You can usually move your 401(k) balance to your new employer's plan. As with an IRA rollover, this maintains the account's tax-deferred status and avoids immediate taxes.



It could be a wise move if you aren't comfortable with making the investment decisions involved in managing a rollover IRA and would rather leave some of that work to the new plan's administrator.




How Do You Start a 401(k)?
The simplest way to start a 401(k) plan is through your employer. Many companies offer 401(k) plans and some will match part of an employee's contributions. In this case, your 401(k) paperwork and payments will be handled by the company during onboarding.If you are self-employed or run a small business with your spouse, you may be eligible for a solo 401(k) plan, also known as an independent 401(k). These retirement plans allow freelancers and independent contractors to fund their own retirement, even though they are not employed by another company. A solo 401(k) can be created through most online brokers.




What Is the Maximum Contribution to a 401(k)?
For most people, the maximum contribution to a 401(k) plan is $20,500 in 2022 and $22,500 in 2023. If you are more than 50 years old, you can make an additional 2022 catch-up contribution of $6,500 for a total of $27,000 (the catch-up contribution for 2023 is $7,500 for a total of $30,000). There are also limitations on the employer's matching contribution: The combined employer-employee contributions cannot exceed $61,000 in 2022 (or $67,500 for employees over 50 years old) and $66,000 in 2023 (or $73,500 for employees over 50 years old).




Is It a Good Idea to Take Early Withdrawals From Your 401(k)?
There are few advantages to taking an early withdrawal from a 401(k) plan. If you take withdrawals before age 59½, you will face a 10% penalty in addition to any taxes you owe. However, some employers allow hardship withdrawals for sudden financial needs, such as medical costs, funeral costs, or buying a home. This can help you avoid the early withdrawal penalty but you will still have to pay taxes on the withdrawal.




What Is the Main Benefit of a 401(k)?
A 401(k) plan lets you reduce your tax burden while saving for retirement. Not only do you get tax-deferred gains but it's also hassle-free since contributions are automatically subtracted from your paycheck. In addition, many employers will match part of their employee's 401(k) contributions, effectively giving them a free boost to their retirement savings.


   The Bottom Line  

A 401(k) plan is a workplace retirement plan that lets you make annual contributions up to a certain limit and invest that money for the benefit of your later years once your working days are done.



401(k) plans come in two types: a traditional or Roth. The traditional 401(k) involves pre-tax contributions that give you a tax break when you make them and reduce your taxable income. However, you pay ordinary income tax on your withdrawals. The Roth 401(k) involves after-tax contributions and no upfront tax break, but you'll pay no taxes on your withdrawals in retirement. Both accounts allow employer contributions that can increase your savings.
What Is a 403(b) Plan?  

The term 403(b) plan refers to a retirement account designed for certain employees of public schools and other tax-exempt organizations. Participants may include teachers, school administrators, professors, government employees, nurses, doctors, and librarians.



The 403(b) plan, which is closely related to the better-known 401(k) plan, allows participants to save money for retirement through payroll deductions while enjoying certain tax benefits. There's also an option for the employer to match part of the employee's contribution.





Key Takeaways

403(b)s are retirement savings plans that serve employees of public schools and tax-exempt organizations.Contributions to 403(b) plans are made through payroll deductions.The IRS limits the amount that employees can contribute to their 403(b) plans.The advantages of a 403(b) include faster vesting of funds and the ability to make additional catch-up contributions.Investment choices may be more limited with a 403(b) and some accounts offer less protection from creditors than 401(k)s.


   How 403(b) Plans Work  

As noted above, individuals employed by schools and other tax-exempt organizations can save for retirement by contributing to a 403(b) plan through payroll deductions. The plan is akin to the 401(k) plan used by private-sector employees. Participants can include:



Employees of public schools, state colleges, and universities
Public school employees of Indian tribal governments
Church employees
Employees of tax-exempt 501(c)(3) organizations
Ministers and clergy members



The 403(b) plan has the same caps on yearly contributions that come with 401(k) plans. The maximum contributions allowed are $20,500 and $22,500 for the 2022 and 2023 tax years respectively. For 2022, he plan also offers $6,500 catch-up contributions for those age 50 and older, increasing to $7,500 for 2023. Combined employee and employer contributions are limited to the lesser of $61,000 in 2022 and $66,000 in 2023 or 100% of the employee's most recent yearly salary.



Participants must reach age 59½ before withdrawing funds or get slapped with an early withdrawal penalty. 






If your employer offers a 403(b) and a 401(k) you can contribute to both but your aggregate contribution cannot be more than the annual limit ($20,500 in 2022 and $22,500 in 2023)—not counting any catch-up contributions.


   Special Considerations  

Although it is not very common, your job situation could end up giving you access to both a 401(k) and a 403(b) plan. Each offers employees a tax-advantaged way to save for retirement, but investment choices are often more limited in a 403(b) plan than a 401(k). And remember, 401(k)s serve private-sector employees.



But unlike a 401(k), the 403(b) plan also offers a special plan for those with 15 or more years of service with the same employer (see below).

   Types of 403(b) Plans  

There are generally two broad types of 403(b) plan—the traditional and the Roth. Not all employers allow employees access to the Roth version.



A traditional 403(b) plan allows the employee to have pretax money automatically deducted from each paycheck and paid into a personal retirement account. The employee has put away some money for the future and at the same time reduced his or her gross income (and income taxes owed for the year). The taxes will be due on that money only when the employee withdraws it.



A Roth 403(b) requires that after-tax money be paid into the retirement account. There's no immediate tax advantage. But the employee will not owe any more taxes on that money or the profit it accrues when it is withdrawn.






Clergy can also participate in a 403(b) but there's a special plan type—a 403(b)(9)—that's designed specifically for employees of religious institutions.


   Advantages and Disadvantages of 403(b) Plans  

There are distinct benefits and drawbacks of holding a 403(b) plan. We've highlighted some of the most common ones below.


  Advantages  

Earnings and returns on amounts in a regular 403(b) plan are tax-deferred until they are withdrawn. Earnings and returns on amounts in a Roth 403(b) are tax-deferred if the withdrawals are qualified distributions.



Certain 403(b) plans are not required to meet the onerous oversight rules of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA). As such, these plans tend to come with lower administrative costs, which puts more money back into the employee's pocket.



Many 403(b) plans vest funds over a shorter period than 401(k)s, and some even allow immediate vesting of funds, which 401(k)s rarely do.



If an employee has 15 or more years of service with certain nonprofits or government agencies, they may be able to make additional catch-up contributions to a 403(b) plan. Under this provision, you can contribute an additional $3,000 a year, up to a lifetime limit of $15,000. And unlike the usual retirement plan catch-up provisions, you don't have to be 50 or older to take advantage of this as long as you worked for the same eligible employer for the whole 15 years.


  Disadvantages  

Funds withdrawn from a 403(b) plan before age 59½ are subject to a 10% tax penalty, although you may avoid the penalty under certain circumstances, such as separating from an employer at age 55 or older, needing to pay a qualified medical expense, or becoming disabled.



A 403(b) may offer a narrower choice of investments than other plans. Although these plans now offer mutual fund options inside variable annuity contracts. you can only choose between fixed and variable contracts, and mutual funds inside these plans⁠—other securities, such as stocks and real estate investment trusts (REITs), are prohibited.



The presence of an investment option that 403(b)s favor is, at best, a mixed blessing. When the 403(b) was invented in 1958, it was known as a tax-sheltered annuity. While times have changed, and 403(b) plans can now offer mutual funds, as noted, many still emphasize annuities.



Financial advisors often recommend against investing in annuities within a 403(b) and other tax-deferred investment plans. Accounts may lack the same level of protection from creditors as plans that require ERISA compliance. If you are at risk of creditors pursuing you, speak to a local attorney who understands the nuances of your state as the laws can be complex.



Another disadvantage of non-ERISA 403(b)s is their exemption from nondiscrimination testing. Done annually, this testing is designed to prevent management-level or highly compensated employees from receiving a disproportionate amount of benefits from a given plan.





Pros

Earnings and returns in regular 403(b) plans are tax-deferred until they are withdrawn
Plans that aren't subject to ERISA requirements come with lower administrative costs
Many 403(b) plans vest funds over a shorter period and some allow immediate vesting
Employees with 15 or more years of service may be eligible for increased catch-up contributions



Cons

Withdrawals before age 59½ are subject to a 10% tax penalty
Plans may offer a narrower choice of investments than other retirement options
Accounts within a 403(b) may lack the same protection from creditors as plans with ERISA compliance
Non-ERISA 403(b)s is exempt from nondiscrimination testing







What Are the Similarities Between 401(k) and 403(b)?
The 403(b) plan is in many ways similar to its better-known cousin, the 401(k) plan. Each offers employees a tax-advantaged way to save for retirement. Both have the same basic contribution limits: $20,500 in 2022 and $22,500 in 2023.The combination of employee and employer contributions is limited to the lesser of $61,000 in 2022 ($66,000 in 2023) or 100% of the employee's most recent yearly salary.Both offer Roth options and require participants to reach age 59½ to withdraw funds without incurring an early withdrawal penalty. Like a 401(k), the 403(b) plan offers $6,500 catch-up contributions for those age 50 and older in 2022, raising to $7,500 in 2023.




What Are the Advantages of a 403(b) Plan?
Earnings and returns on amounts in a regular 403(b) plan are tax-deferred until they are withdrawn and tax-deferred if the Roth 403(b) withdrawals are qualified distributions. Employees with a 403(b) may also be eligible for matching contributions, the amount of which varies by employer.Many 403(b) plans vest funds over a shorter period than 401(k)s, and some even allow immediate vesting of funds, which 401(k)s rarely do.Certain nonprofits or government agencies also allow employees with 15 or more years of service to make additional catch-up contributions. Under this provision, you can contribute an additional $3,000 a year up to a lifetime limit of $15,000 and, unlike the usual retirement plan catch-up provisions, you don't have to be 50 or older to take advantage of this.Finally, certain 403(b) plans are not required to meet the onerous oversight rules of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act.




What Are the Drawbacks of a 403(b) Plan?
Funds that are generally withdrawn from a 403(b) plan before age 59½ are subject to a 10% penalty. One may avoid this penalty under certain circumstances, such as separating from an employer at age 55 or older, needing to pay a qualified medical expense, or becoming disabled. Plans may also offer a narrower choice of investments than the other types of retirement plans.For 403(b)s without ERISA protection, accounts may lack the same level of protection from creditors as plans that require ERISA compliance.Another disadvantage of non-ERISA 403(b)s includes an exemption from nondiscrimination testing. Done annually, this testing is designed to prevent management-level or highly compensated employees from receiving a disproportionate amount of benefits from a given plan.
What Is a 408(k) Plan?  

The term 408(k) account refers to an employer-sponsored retirement savings plan. A 408(k) plan allows employees to put aside pretax dollars for retirement that grow on a tax-deferred basis, making it a type of individual retirement account (IRA). This means that individuals pay taxes when they make withdrawals after they turn 59½. The 408(k) is commonly referred to as a simplified employee pension (SEP) plan. In fact, it is the SEP version of the popular 401(k) plan.





Key Takeaways

A 408(k) is an employer-sponsored retirement plan akin to a 401(k).The plan is also referred to as a simplified employee pension, which is a type of individual retirement account.The 408(k) plan is available to companies of any size as well as self-employed individuals who are subject to the same contribution limits as employers.Only employer contributions are allowed into the 408(k) plan.The IRS limits how much employers can contribute to their employees' 408(k) plans.


   Understanding 408(k) Plans  

Section 408(k) of the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) outlines the rules and regulations associated with SEP and salary reduction simplified employee pension (SARSEP) accounts, notably individual retirement accounts (IRAs) or individual retirement annuities. That is why SEP plans are often referred to as 408(k) plans.



The IRC highlights the requirements needed in order to participate in a 408(k) plan. Plans are available to small businesses of any size and to self-employed individuals. Participants qualify if they are:



Over the age of 21Worked for at least three of the last five years for the employerWere compensated at least $650 by the employer (for 2022; compensation requirements increase to $750 for 2023)



Annual employer contributions cannot exceed the lesser of 25% of the employee's pay or $61,000 for 2022 ($66,000 for 2023). The annual compensation limit cannot be calculated on incomes exceeding $305,000 for 2022 ($330,000 in 2023). The maximum deduction claimed on a business tax return for contributions is the lesser of the total contributions into employees' accounts or 25% of compensation.



Plan holders can make withdrawals from their 408(k) plans at any time—the same way they would from traditional IRAs. But there are certain conditions that apply. For instance, most individuals make withdrawals after they turn 59½. Any distributions from these plans before that age incur a 10% early withdrawal penalty. Withdrawals must be made as required minimum distributions (RMDs) as of April 1 the year after you turn 72 if you reached that age on or before Dec. 31, 2022. You must begin taking RMDs if you turn 73 on or after Jan. 1, 2023.






Unlike traditional retirement plans, SEPs don't have the same start-up or administrative costs.


   408(k) Plans vs. 401(k) Plans  

As noted above, a 408(k) is one type of employer-sponsored retirement plan. The 401(k) plan is the most common option and is offered by the vast majority of American corporations. The plan allows taxpayers to make pre-tax contributions through automatic payroll deductions and employer matches for those that make them.



Plan reform has made several changes to benefit employees, including lower fees and investment options. The average 401(k) plan now offers over two dozen investment options by balancing risk and reward, in accordance with an employee's preferences. Unlike an SEP, employees may contribute to a 401(k) plan. A solo 401(k) plan is also available to self-employed individuals or couples, with the same total contribution limits as an employer-sponsored plan.



Participation in traditional 401(k) plans continues to grow. These plans held roughly $6.3 trillion in assets by September of 2022, which represented more than half of the retirement market in the United States. There were 625,000 active plans in the country with a total of 60 million former employees and retirees at the end of September 2022.



Here are a few other facts related to the 401(k) that taxpayers should know:



Contribution limits for 401(k) plans are indexed to inflation. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) allowed employees to save up to $20,500 for 2022, rising to $22,500 for 2023. Catch-up contributions of $6,500 per year (increasing to $7,500 in 2023) are also allowed for people 50 or older.
Withdrawals before the age of 59½ often result in a 10% early withdrawal penalty, unless an exemption is applied. Taxes are imposed on any withdrawals made as contributions are made with pretax earnings.
Individuals who turn 72 between Jan. 1, 2020, and Dec. 31, 2022, must begin taking RMDs the following April 1.  The SECURE ACT 2.0 raised that age to 73 for anyone who turned that age on or after Jan. 1, 2023.



Correction—Jan. 27, 2023: A previous version of this article misstated that 408(k) plans are available to companies with 25 employees or less. It was corrected to state that plans are open to companies of any size.
What Was a 412(i) Plan?  

A 412(i) plan was a defined-benefit pension plan that was designed for small business owners in the U.S. It was classified as a tax-qualified pension plan, so any amount that the owner contributed to it could immediately be taken as a tax deduction by the company. Guaranteed annuities or a combination of annuities and life insurance were the only things that could fund a 412(i) plan. The 412(i) plan was replaced by the 412(e)(3) plan after Dec. 31, 2007.





Key Takeaways

A 412(i) plan was a defined-benefit pension plan that was designed for small business owners in the U.S.A 412(i) was a tax-qualified benefit plan, meaning the owner's contributions to the plan became a tax deduction for the company.Guaranteed annuities or a combination of annuities and life insurance were the only things that could fund the plan.Due to tax avoidance schemes that were occurring under 412(i), the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) replaced it with 412(e)(3).


   Understanding a 412(i) Plan  

Notably, 412(i) plans were developed for small business owners who often found it difficult to invest in their company while trying to save for employees' retirement. The 412(i) plan was unique in that it provided fully guaranteed retirement benefits.



An insurance company had to sponsor the 412(i) plan, and only insurance products like annuities and life insurance policies could fund it. Contributions to it provide the largest tax deduction possible.



An annuity is a financial product that an individual can purchase via a lump-sum payment or installments. The insurance company, in turn, pays the owner a fixed stream of payments at some point in the future. Annuities are primarily used as an income stream for retirees. 



Due to the large premiums that had to be paid into the plan each year, a 412(i) plan was not ideal for all small business owners. The plan tended to benefit small businesses that were more established and profitable.



For example, a startup that had gone through several rounds of funding would have been in a better position to create a 412(i) plan than one that was bootstrapped and/or had angel or seed funding.



These companies also often don't generate enough free cash flow (FCF) to put away consistently for employees’ retirement. Instead, the founding team members often re-invest any profits or outside funding back into their product or service to generate new sales and make updates to their core offerings.


   412(i) Plans and Compliance Issues  

In August 2017, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) identified 412(i) plans as being involved in various types of non-compliance. These also included abusive tax avoidance transaction issues. To help organizations with 412(i) plans come into compliance, the IRS developed the following survey. They asked:



Do you have a 412(i) plan?
If so, how do you fund this plan? (i.e., annuities, insurance contracts, or a combination?)
What is the amount of the death benefit relative to the amount of retirement benefit for each plan participant?
Have you had a listed transaction under Revenue Ruling 2004-20? If so, have you filed Form 8886, Reportable Transaction Disclosure Statement?
Finally, who sold the annuities and/or insurance contracts to the sponsor?



A survey of 329 plans yielded the following:



185 plans referred for examination139 plans deemed to be "compliance sufficient"Three plans under "current examination"One plan noted as "compliance verified" (meaning no further contact was necessary)One plan labeled as not a 412(i) plan


   412(e)(3)  

Due to the abuses of the 412(i) plan resulting in tax avoidance schemes, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) moved the 412(i) provisions to 412(e)(3), effective for plans beginning after Dec. 31, 2007. 412(e)(3) functions similarly to 412(i), except that it is exempt from the minimum funding rule. According to the IRS, the requirements for 412(e)(3) are as follows:



Plans must be funded exclusively by the purchase of a combination of annuities and life insurance contracts or individual annuities,Plan contracts must provide for level annual premium payments to be paid extending not later than the retirement age for each individual participating in the plan, and commencing with the date the individual became a participant in the plan (or, in the case of an increase in benefits, commencing at the time such increase becomes effective),Benefits provided by the plan are equal to the benefits provided under each contract at normal retirement age under the plan and are guaranteed by an insurance carrier (licensed under the laws of a state to do business with the plan) to the extent premiums have been paid,Premiums payable under such contracts for the plan year, and all prior plan years, have been paid before lapse or there is a reinstatement of the policy,No rights under such contracts have been subject to a security interest at any time during the plan year, andNo policy loans are outstanding at any time during the plan year
What Is a 457 Plan?  

A 457 plan is a tax-advantaged retirement savings plan offered to employees of many state and local governments and some nonprofit organizations. Like the better-known 401(k) plan in the private sector, the 457 plan allows employees to deposit a portion of their pre-tax earnings in an account, reducing their income taxes for the year while postponing the taxes due until the money is withdrawn after they retire.



A Roth version of the 457 plan, which allows after-tax contributions, may be allowed at the employer's discretion.



There are two main types of 457 plans:



The 457(b): This is the most common 457 plan and is offered to state and local government employees and nonprofits. It is a retirement savings plan that offers tax advantages to participants.The 457(f): This plan is offered only to highly compensated executives in tax-exempt organizations. It is a supplement to the 457(b) and it is, essentially, a deferred salary plan.





Key Takeaways

The 457 plan is an IRS-sanctioned, tax-advantaged employee retirement plan.The plan is offered only to public service employees and employees at tax-exempt organizations.Participants are allowed to contribute up to 100% of their salaries up to a dollar limit for the year.The interest and earnings in the account are not taxed until the funds are withdrawn. The exception is the Roth option, if available, in which only post-tax money is deposited.

   Types of 457 Plans  

As noted, the 457 plan comes in two flavors, the 457(b) and the 457(f).


  The 457(b) Plan  

The 457(b) plan is most often offered to civil servants, police personnel, and other employees of government agencies, public services, and nonprofit organizations such as hospitals, churches, and charitable organizations.



It is similar to a 401(k). Participants set aside a percentage of their salary into a retirement account. The employees choose how their money is invested from a list of options, mostly mutual funds and annuities.



The account grows in value without being taxed over the years. When the employee retires, taxes will be due on the amount withdrawn.



Employees are allowed to contribute up to 100% of their salary, provided it does not exceed the dollar limit set for the year.






If the 457 plan does not meet statutory requirements, the assets may be subject to different rules.


   457(b) Contribution Limits  

As of 2022, employees can contribute up to $20,500 per year to 457 plans. This limit increases to $22,500 for 2023.



In some cases, workers are allowed to contribute even more. For example, if an employer permits catch-up contributions, workers over the age of 50 may pay in an additional $6,500 a year, making their maximum contribution limit $27,000 ($20,500 + $6,500) in 2022. The catch-up contribution increases to $7,500 for tax year 2023, making the maximum contribution limit $30,000 ($22,500 + $7,500).



Also, 457(b) plans feature a "double limit catch-up" provision. This is designed to allow participants who are nearing retirement to compensate for years in which they did not contribute to the plan but were eligible to do so.



In this case, employees who are within three years of retirement age may contribute up to $41,000 in 2022 and up to $45,000 in 2023. 


   Advantages and Disadvantages of a 457(b) Plan  

The 457(b) plan has all of the advantages of a 401(k), although there are some differences.


  Advantages of a 457(b)  

Tax Benefits



If a traditional rather than a Roth plan is chosen, the contributions are deducted from an employee's paycheck on a pre-tax basis. That amount is subtracted from the employee's gross income, effectively lowering the person's taxes paid for that year. For example, if Alex earns $4,000 per month and contributes $700 to a 457(b) plan, Alex's taxable income for the month is $3,300.



Employees invest their contributions in their choice or choices from a selection of annuities and mutual funds.



All interest and earnings generated from year to year remain untaxed until the funds are withdrawn.



Withdrawals Without Penalty



There is one big difference between the 457(b) and other tax-advantaged retirement plans: no penalty for early withdrawals in some circumstances.



If an employee retires early or resigns from the job for any reason, the funds can be withdrawn without incurring a 10% penalty from the IRS. Early withdrawals from most retirement plans are subject to the penalty except for certain hardship reasons. (The penalty was waived for two years during the COVID-19 pandemic.) 



A 457(b) account holder can take a penalty-free withdrawal without changing jobs, like a 401(k) account holder. The list of acceptable reasons, however, is limited to "unforeseeable emergencies."



Exceptions to the Rules



Early withdrawals from a 457(b) are subject to the 10% penalty if the account holder rolls the funds over from a 457 to any other tax-advantaged retirement account, such as a 401(k). This would happen if, for example, a government employee quit to take a job in the private sector.



In addition, anyone who takes money out of a retirement account early must keep in mind that any income taxes due on that money will be owed in the year that the withdrawal is taken.


  Disadvantages of a 457(b) Plan  

One potential advantage of most tax-advantaged retirement savings plans is the employer match. An employer may choose to match some portion of an employee's contribution to the plan. An employer who matches the first 3% of the employee's contribution, for example, is presenting the employee with a 3% raise.



Employer Match Is Rare



Employers can match their employees' contributions to a 457(b) but, in practice, most don't.



If they do, the employer contribution counts toward the maximum contribution limit. This is not the case for 401(k) plans.



For instance, in 2022, if an employer contributes $10,000 to a 457(b) plan, the employee can add only $10,500 for the year until the $20,500 contribution limit is reached (except for those eligible to use the catch-up option).





457(b) Advantages

Looser rules for early withdrawals without a penalty.
Early distributions allowed for participants who leave a job.
As with other retirement plans, no taxes are due until money is withdrawn.



457(b) Disadvantages

Employer contributions count toward contribution limit the year they vest.
Employer contributions subject to vesting schedule. If the employee quits, non-vested funds are forfeited.
Limited investment choices compared to private sector plans.





   457(b) vs. 403(b)  

The 403(b) plan, like the 457(b), is mostly available to public service employees. They are a particularly common benefit offered to public school teachers.



The 403(b) has its origins in the 1950s when it exclusively offered an annuity to participants. Participants still have the option of creating an annuity but they also can choose to invest in mutual funds.



In fact, the 403(b) has changed over the years until it closely resembles the private sector's 401(k) plan, although the investment choices offered to participants are relatively limited.



The annual contribution limits are identical to those of the 457(b) and 401(k) plans.



If you're a public employee, your employer may well offer a 457(b) or a 403(b).





Advisor Insight

Dan Stewart, CFA®Revere Asset Management, Dallas, TX
457 plans are taxed as income similar to a 401(k) or 403(b) when distributions are taken. The only difference is there are no withdrawal penalties and that they are the only plans without early withdrawal penalties. But you also have the option of rolling the assets in an IRA rollover. This way, you can better control distributions and only take them when needed.
So if you take the entire amount as a lump sum, the entire amount is added to your income and may push you into a higher tax bracket.
With the rollover route, you could take out a little this year, and so on as needed, thus controlling your taxes better. And while it remains inside the IRA, it continues to grow tax-deferred and is protected from creditors.




What Is the Difference Between a 457(b) Plan and a 457(f) Plan?
The 457(b) plan is a version of the 401(k) plan that is designed for public and nonprofit workers. It helps employees save for retirement while deferring the tax bill until they retire and start withdrawing the money. (The Roth version, which is available only at the employer's discretion, takes the taxes upfront, so no taxes are usually due on withdrawals.)The 457(f) plan is also known as a SERP for Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan. It is a retirement savings plan for only the highest-paid executives in the tax-exempt sector. They are mostly employed in hospitals, universities, and credit unions.A 457(f) is a supplement to a 457(b). Employers make additional contributions to the employee's account, beyond the usual limits. These are negotiated by contract and amount to a deferred salary adjustment.If the executive resigns before an established vesting period, the 457(f) contribution disappears. The plan is intended as an executive retention strategy, commonly known as "golden handcuffs."




Is a 457(b) Plan Better Than a 401(k) Plan?
For all intents and purposes, a 457(b) is just as good as a 401(k) plan. If you're employer is a public agency or a nonprofit, it's probably your best option for retirement savings.Assuming you opt for a traditional plan rather than a Roth plan, you'll be lowering your taxable income from year to year while plunking that money into a long-term investment account. The money won't be taxed until you retire and start taking withdrawals.(If it's a Roth, you'll pay the taxes up front and usually will owe no taxes on the money you deposited or the profits it earns over the years.)On the downside, your contributions will probably not be matched by your employer. But that's just reality in the nonprofit sector, not a rule of the plan.




How and When Can I Make Withdrawals From My 457(b) Account?
One advantage of a 457(b) is that you can take early withdrawals without paying a tax penalty for any "unforeseeable emergency." This isn't a good idea, since you're plundering your retirement savings, but unforeseeable emergencies do happen. And, you'll owe income tax for that year on the amount you withdraw.The required minimum distribution (RMD) you must take is determined by an IRS worksheet. An RMD is a minimum amount that must be withdrawn from certain retirement plans, like a 457(b), each year once you reach a certain age. If you were born between 1951 and 1959, the age is 73. If you were born in 1960 or after, the age is 75. This is an increase from the previous age of 72.
What Is the 48-Hour Rule?  

The 48-hour rule is a requirement that sellers of to-be-announced (TBA) mortgage-backed securities (MBS) communicate all pool information regarding the MBS to buyers before 3 p.m. Eastern Time, 48 hours before the settlement date of the trade. The Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association (SIFMA) enforces this rule. SIFMA was formerly known as the Public Securities Association or Bond Market Association.





Key Takeaways

The 48-hour rule refers to a part of the mortgage allocation process related to the buying and selling of to-be-announced (TBA) mortgage-backed securities (MBS).The 48-hour rule stipulates that the seller of an MBS notifies the buyer with the details of the underlying mortgages that make up the MBS by 3 p.m. Eastern Time, 48 hours before the settlement date.The Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association (SIFMA) enforces the 48-hour rule.When an MBS is traded in the secondary market, the underlying mortgages are not known, which helps facilitate trading and liquidity.Certain information is agreed upon when an MBS trade is made, such as the price, par, and coupon, but not the underlying mortgages.The TBA market is the second most traded secondary market after the U.S. Treasury market.


   Understanding the 48-Hour Rule  

An MBS is a bond that is secured, or backed, by mortgage loans. Loans with similar traits are grouped to form a pool. The pool is then sold as a security to investors. The issuance of interest and principal payments to investors is at a rate based on the principal and interest payments made by the borrowers of the underlying mortgages. Investors receive interest payments monthly rather than semiannually.



A to-be-announced (TBA) trade is effectively a contract to buy or sell mortgage-backed securities (MBS) on a specific date. It does not include information regarding the pool number, the number of pools, or the exact amount involved in the transaction, which means the underlying mortgages are not known to the parties. This exclusion of data is due to the TBA market assuming that MBS pools are more or less interchangeable. This interchangeability helps facilitate trading and liquidity.



The 48-hour rule is part of the mortgage allocation process, the period when the underlying mortgages will be assigned and made available to a specific MBS, which was created to bring transparency to TBA trade settlements.



The 48-hour rule states that the seller of a specific MBS must make the buyer of that MBS aware of the mortgages that make up the MBS 48 hours prior to the trade settling. Because of the standard T+3 settlement date, this usually occurs on the day after the trade is executed.


   The 48-Hour Rule as Part of the TBA Process  

The TBA process benefits buyers and sellers because it increases the liquidity of the MBS market by taking thousands of different mortgage-backed securities with different characteristics and trading them through a handful of contracts.



Buyers and sellers of TBA trades agree on a few necessary parameters such as issuer maturity, coupon, price, par amount, and settlement date. The specific securities involved in the trade are announced 48 hours before the settlement.



The TBA market was established in the 1970s to facilitate the trading of MBS issued by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and Ginnie Mae. It allows mortgage lenders to hedge their origination pipelines.



The TBA market is the most liquid secondary market for mortgage loans, resulting in high levels of market activity. In fact, the amount of money traded on the TBA market is second only to the U.S. Treasury market.


   Example of the 48-Hour Rule  

Company ABC decides to sell a mortgage-backed security (MBS) to Company XYZ and Company XYZ accepts. The sale will take place on Tuesday. On Tuesday, when the sale is made, neither Company ABC nor Company XYZ knows the underlying mortgages that make up the mortgage-backed security (MBS).



The standard industry settlement is T+3 days, meaning this trade will settle on Friday. According to the 48-hour rule, on Wednesday before 3 p.m. Eastern Time, Company ABC will have to notify Company XYZ of the mortgage allocations it will receive when the trade settles.
What Is a 5/1 Hybrid Adjustable-Rate Mortgage (5/1 ARM)?  

A 5/1 hybrid adjustable-rate mortgage (5/1 ARM) begins with an initial five-year fixed interest rate period, followed by a rate that adjusts on an annual basis. The “5” in the term refers to the number of years with a fixed rate, and the “1” refers to how often the rate adjusts after that (once per year). As such, monthly payments can go up—sometimes dramatically—after five years.





Key Takeaways

5/1 hybrid adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs) offer an introductory fixed rate for five years, after which the interest rate adjusts annually.When ARMs adjust, interest rates change based on their marginal rates and the indexes to which they’re tied.Homeowners generally enjoy lower mortgage payments during the introductory period.A fixed-rate mortgage may be preferable for homeowners who prefer predictability with their mortgage payments and interest costs.


   How a Hybrid Adjustable-Rate Mortgage (Such as a 5/1 Hybrid ARM) Works  

The 5/1 hybrid ARM may be the most popular type of adjustable-rate mortgage, but it’s not the only option. There are 3/1, 7/1, and 10/1 ARMs as well. These loans offer an introductory fixed rate for three, seven, or 10 years, respectively, after which they adjust annually.



Also known as a five-year fixed-period ARM or a five-year ARM, this mortgage features an interest rate that adjusts according to an index plus a margin. Hybrid ARMs are very popular with consumers, as they may feature an initial interest rate significantly lower than a traditional fixed-rate mortgage. Most lenders offer at least one version of such hybrid ARMs; of these loans, the 5/1 hybrid ARM is especially popular.



Other ARM structures exist, such as the 5/5 and 5/6 ARMs, which also feature a five-year introductory period followed by a rate adjustment every five years or every six months, respectively. Notably, 15/15 ARMs adjust once after 15 years and then remain fixed for the remainder of the loan. Less common are 2/28 and 3/27 ARMs. With the former, the fixed interest rate applies for only the first two years, followed by 28 years of adjustable rates; with the latter, the fixed rate is for three years, with adjustments in each of the following 27 years. Some of these loans adjust every six months rather than annually.






Hybrid ARMs have a fixed interest rate for a set period of years, followed by an extended period during which rates are adjustable.


   Example of a 5/1 Hybrid ARM  

Interest rates change based on their marginal rates when ARMs adjust along with the indexes to which they’re tied. If a 5/1 hybrid ARM has a 3% margin and the index is 3%, then it adjusts to 6%.



But the extent to which the fully indexed interest rate on a 5/1 hybrid ARM can adjust is often limited by an interest rate cap structure. The fully indexed interest rate can be tied to several different indexes, and while this number varies, the margin is fixed for the life of the loan.



A borrower can save a significant sum on their monthly payments with a 5/1 hybrid ARM. Assuming a home purchase price of $300,000 with a 20% down payment ($60,000), a borrower with very good/excellent credit can save 50 to 150 basis points on a loan and more than $100 per month in payments on their $240,000 loan. Of course, that rate could rise, so borrowers should anticipate a rise in their monthly payment, be prepared to sell their home when their rate goes up, or be ready to refinance.





Note

When refinancing from an ARM to a fixed-rate mortgage, it’s important to consider the new loan term carefully, as it could have a significant impact on how much you pay in total interest to own the home.


   Advantages and Disadvantages of a 5/1 Hybrid ARM  

In most cases, ARMs offer lower introductory rates than traditional mortgages with fixed interest rates. These loans can be ideal for buyers who plan to live in their homes for only a short period of time and sell before the end of the introductory period. The 5/1 hybrid ARM also works well for buyers who plan to refinance before the introductory rate expires. That said, hybrid ARMs like the 5/1 tend to have a higher interest rate than standard ARMs.





Pros

Lower introductory rates than traditional fixed-interest mortgages
Interest rates possibly drop before the mortgage adjusts, resulting in lower payments
Good for buyers who will live in their homes for short periods of time



Cons

Higher interest rates than standard adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs)
When mortgage adjusts, interest rates probably rise
Could be trapped in unaffordable rate hikes due to personal issues or market forces






There’s also a chance that the interest rate might decrease, lowering the borrower’s monthly payments when it adjusts. But in many cases, the rate will rise, increasing the borrower’s monthly payments.



If a borrower takes out an ARM with the intention of getting out of the mortgage by selling or refinancing before the rate resets, then personal finances or market forces might trap them in the loan, potentially subjecting them to a rate hike that they can’t afford. Consumers considering an ARM should educate themselves on how they work.


   5/1 Hybrid ARM vs. Fixed-Rate Mortgage  

A 5/1 hybrid ARM may be a good mortgage option for some homebuyers. But for others, a fixed-rate mortgage may be more appropriate. A fixed-rate mortgage has one set interest rate for the life of the loan. The rate is not tied to an underlying benchmark or index rate and doesn’t change; the interest rate charged on the first payment is the same interest that applies to the final payment.



A fixed-rate mortgage could yield advantages for a certain type of homebuyer. If you’re interested in predictability and stability with mortgage rates, for example, then you might lean toward a fixed-rate loan instead of a 5/1 hybrid ARM. Comparing them side by side can make it easier to decide on a mortgage option.









5/1 Hybrid ARM vs. Fixed-Rate Mortgage




5/1 Hybrid ARM
Fixed-Rate Mortgage


The loan’s interest rate adjusts after the initial fixed-rate period.
The interest rate remains the same for the life of the loan.


Monthly payments could increase or decrease as the rate adjusts.
Monthly payments are predictable and do not fluctuate due to changing rates.


More difficult to estimate the total cost of borrowing as rates adjust.
Homebuyers can estimate their total cost of borrowing over the life of the loan.





   Is a 5/1 Hybrid ARM a Good Idea?  

A 5/1 hybrid ARM could be a good choice for homebuyers who don’t plan to stay in the home long term or who are confident in their ability to refinance to a new loan before the rate adjusts. If interest rates remain low and adjustments to the index rate are relatively minor, then a 5/1 hybrid ARM could save you more money over time compared to a fixed-rate mortgage.



But it’s important to consider how feasible refinancing is and where interest rates might be when you’re ready to move to a new loan. If interest rates rise, then refinancing to a new fixed-rate loan or even to a new ARM may not yield that much in interest savings.



If you don’t plan to refinance and don’t plan to move, then it’s important to consider how realistic that might be for your budget if a rate adjustment substantially increases your monthly payment. If the payment becomes too much for your budget to handle, you may be forced into a situation where you have to sell the property or refinance. And in a worst-case scenario, you could end up facing foreclosure if you default on the loan payments.






If you’re interested in refinancing from a 5/1 hybrid ARM to a fixed-rate mortgage, consider the interest rates for which you’re likely to qualify, based on your credit history and income, to determine if it’s worthwhile.
What Is a 5/6 Hybrid Adjustable-Rate Mortgage (ARM)?  

A 5/6 hybrid adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM) has a fixed interest rate for the first five years, after which the interest rate can change every six months. A 5/6 hybrid adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM) combines the characteristics of a traditional fixed-rate mortgage with those of an adjustable-rate mortgage.





Key Takeaways

A 5/6 hybrid ARM has an interest rate fixed for the first five years, then adjusts every six months.The adjustable interest rate on 5/6 hybrid ARMs is usually tied to a common benchmark index.A risk associated with an adjustable interest rate is a rising rate may make monthly payments unaffordable.


   How a 5/6 Hybrid Adjustable-Rate Mortgage (ARM) Works  

A 5/6 hybrid ARM starts with a fixed interest rate and then the interest rate becomes adjustable for the remaining years of the loan. The adjustable rate is based on a benchmark index, such as the prime rate.



The lender will also add additional percentage points, known as a margin. If the index is currently at 4% and the lender’s margin is 3%, then the fully indexed interest rate for the borrower will be 7%.



A 5/6 hybrid ARM should have caps on how much the interest rate can rise over the life of the loan. This offers protection against rising interest rates that could make the monthly mortgage payments unmanageable.






See our picks for Best Mortgage Lenders in 2023.


   How Are 5/6 Hybrid ARMs Indexed?  

Lenders use different indexes to set interest rates on 5/6 hybrid ARMs. The U.S. prime rate and Constant Maturity Treasury (CMT) rate are commonly used. In a rising interest-rate environment, the longer the period between interest-rate reset dates, the better it will be for the borrower. A 5/1 hybrid ARM would be better than a 5/6 ARM because its interest rate would not rise as quickly. The opposite would be true in a falling interest-rate environment.


   5/6 Hybrid ARM vs. Fixed-Rate Mortgage  
  Advantages of a 5/6 Hybrid ARM  

Many adjustable-rate mortgages, including 5/6 hybrid ARMs, start with lower interest rates than fixed-rate mortgages, providing the borrower with a significant savings advantage, especially if they expect to sell the home or refinance their mortgage before the fixed-rate period of the ARM ends. Borrowers should ensure that it doesn’t impose costly prepayment penalties for getting out of the mortgage early.


  Disadvantages of a 5/6 Hybrid ARM  

The 5/6 hybrid ARM comes with interest rate risk. Because the interest rate can increase every six months after the first five years, the monthly payments may become unaffordable for the borrower. With a fixed-rate mortgage, the interest rate will never rise. The interest rate risk is mitigated if the 5/6 hybrid ARM has periodic and lifetime caps on any interest rate increases.




What Is an Adjustable Rate Mortgage?
An adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM) is a home loan with a variable interest rate. With an ARM, the initial interest rate is fixed for a period. After that, the interest rate applied on the outstanding balance resets periodically, at yearly or even monthly intervals.




How Is the Interest Rate on a 5/6 ARM Determined?
The lender will set the five-year fixed rate based on creditworthiness and the prevailing interest rates. When the adjustable rate kicks in after five years, it will be based on a benchmark index, such as the prime rate, plus an additional percentage added by the lender, known as the margin.




Does Anything Prevent Interest Rates from Rising Too High on a 5/6 ARM?
Many 5/6 hybrid ARMs and other types of ARMs have caps that limit how much rates can rise in any given period and total over the life of the loan.


   The Bottom Line  

A 5/6 hybrid adjustable-rate mortgage has a fixed interest rate for the first five years, and then the rate adjusts every six months. The rate is commonly linked to a benchmark index, such as the prime rate.
What Was the 500 Shareholder Threshold?  

The 500 shareholder threshold for investors is an outdated rule required by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that triggered public reporting requirements of a company when it reached that many or more distinct shareholders. Section 12(g) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 calls for issuers of securities to register with the SEC and begin public dissemination of financial information within 120 days of the end of a fiscal year.



New regulations now require a 2,000 shareholder threshold.





Key Takeaways

The 500 shareholder threshold was a rule mandated by the SEC that required companies to publicly disclose financial statements and other information if they achieved 500 or more distinct shareholders.The rule, in place from 1964-2012, was meant to discourage fraud, opacity, and misinformation alleged in the over-the-counter market.Today, the shareholder threshold is now 2,000, largely in response to the rapid growth of investment in tech start-ups that caused the 500 limit to be reached too quickly.


   Understanding the 500 Shareholder Threshold  

The 500 shareholder threshold was originally introduced in 1964 to address complaints of fraudulent activity appearing in the over-the-counter (OTC) market. Since firms with fewer than the threshold number of investors were not required to disclose their financial information, outside buyers were not able to make fully informed decisions regarding their investments due to a lack of transparency and allegations of stock fraud.



The 500 shareholder threshold forced companies that had more than 499 investors to provide adequate disclosure for the protection of investors and for oversight by regulators. Although the company could remain privately-held, it would have to file public documents in similar fashion to those of publicly traded companies. If the number of investors fell back below 500, then the disclosures would no longer be required.



Private companies generally avoid public reporting as long as possible by keeping the number of individual shareholders low, which is helpful because mandatory reporting can consume a great deal time and money and also places confidential financial data in the hands of competitors.


   The 2,000 Shareholder Threshold  

With the ascendancy of startup firms in the technology sector in the 1990s and 2000s, the 500 shareholder threshold rule became an issue for swiftly growing companies like Google and Amazon that desired to remain private even as it attracted more private investors. While other factors were supposedly in play in the decision of these well-known giants to go public, the 500 rule was a key consideration, according to market observers.



The threshold was thus increased to 2,000 shareholders in 2012 with the passage of the Jumpstart Our Business Startups (JOBS) Act. Now, a private company is allowed to have up to 1,999 holders of record without the registration requirement of the Exchange Act. The current 2,000-shareholder threshold gives the new generation of super-growth companies a bit more privacy and breathing room before they decide to file for an initial public offering (IPO).
What Is a 501(c)(3) Organization?  

Section 501(c)(3) is a portion of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code (IRC) and a specific tax category for nonprofit organizations. Organizations that meet Section 501(c)(3) requirements are exempt from federal income tax. While the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) recognizes more than 30 types of nonprofit organizations, only those that qualify for 501(c)(3) status can say that donations to them are tax deductible.



Most of the organizations that may be eligible for 501(c)(3) designation fall into one of three categories: charitable organizations, churches and religious organizations, and private foundations. The rules outlined in Section 501(c)(3) are regulated by the U.S. Treasury through the IRS.





Key Takeaways

Section 501(c)(3) is a portion of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code (IRC) and a specific tax category for nonprofit organizations.Organizations that meet the requirements of Section 501(c)(3) are exempt from federal income tax.While the IRS recognizes more than 30 types of nonprofit organizations, only organizations that qualify for 501(c)(3) status can say that donations to them are tax deductible.501(c)(3) organizations must pay their employees fair market value wages.To receive its favorable tax treatment, the nonprofit organization must not deviate from its purpose or mission.


   How a 501(c)(3) Organization Works  

To be considered a charitable organization by the IRS, a group must operate exclusively for one of these purposes: charitable, religious, educational, scientific, literary, testing for public safety, fostering national or international amateur sports competition, or preventing cruelty to children or animals.



Furthermore, the IRS defines “charitable” activities as “relief of the poor, the distressed, or the underprivileged; advancement of religion; advancement of education or science; erecting or maintaining public buildings, monuments, or works; lessening the burdens of government; lessening neighborhood tensions; eliminating prejudice and discrimination; defending human and civil rights secured by law; and combating community deterioration and juvenile delinquency.”


   Requirements of a 501(c)(3) Organization  

To be tax-exempt under Section 501(c)(3), an organization must not be serving any private interests, including the interests of the creator, the creator’s family, shareholders of the organization, other designated individuals, or other persons controlled by private interests. None of the net earnings of the organization can be used to benefit any private shareholder or individual; all earnings must be used solely for the advancement of its charitable cause.



A 501(c)(3) organization is also forbidden from using its activities to influence legislation in a substantial way, including participating in any campaign activities to support or deny any particular political candidate. It is typically not permitted to engage in lobbying (except in instances when its expenditures are below a certain amount).



People employed by the organization must be paid “reasonable compensation,” which is based on the fair market value that the job function requires.






Once an organization is categorized as a 501(c)(3), the designation remains as long as the organization exists unless it is revoked by the IRS.



To remain tax exempt under Section 501(c)(3), an organization is also required to remain true to its founding purpose. If an organization has previously reported to the IRS that its mission is to help less privileged individuals gain access to a college education, it must maintain this purpose. If it decides to engage in another calling—for example, sending relief to displaced families in poverty-stricken countries—the 501(c)(3) organization has to first notify the IRS of its change of operations to prevent the loss of its tax-exempt status.



While some unrelated business income is allowed for a 501(c)(3) organization, the tax-exempt charity may not receive substantial income from unrelated business operations. This means that the majority of the firm’s efforts must go toward its exempt purpose as a nonprofit organization. Any unrelated business from sales of merchandise or rental properties must be limited or the organization could lose its 501(c)(3) status. While the IRS doesn’t specify exactly how much is too much unrelated business income, the law firm of Hurwit & Associates, which specializes in representing nonprofits, estimates the amount at somewhere between 15% and 30%.



While organizations that meet the requirements of Section 501(c)(3) are exempt from federal income tax, they are required to withhold federal income tax from their employees’ paychecks and pay Social Security and Medicare taxes. They do not, however, have to pay federal unemployment taxes.


   Special Considerations  

Organizations that meet the 501(c)(3) tax category requirements can be classified into two categories: public charities and private foundations. The main distinction between these two categories is how they get their financial support. 


  Public Charity  

A public charity is a nonprofit organization that receives a substantial portion of its income or revenue from the general public or the government. At least one-third of its income must be received from the donations of the general public (including individuals, corporations, and other nonprofit organizations).



If an individual donates to an organization that the IRS considers to be a public charity, they may qualify for certain tax deductions that can help them lower their taxable income. Generally, the total amount of donations to a tax-exempt public charity that an individual can claim is limited to 50% of their adjusted gross income (AGI). However, there is no limitation on donations to qualified charitable organizations, such as a 501(c)(3).


  Private Foundation  

A private foundation is typically held by an individual, a family, or a corporation and obtains most of its income from a small group of donors. Private foundations are subject to stricter rules and regulations than public charities. All 501(c)(3) organizations are automatically classified as private foundations unless they can prove they meet the IRS standards to be considered a public charity. The deductibility of contributions to a private foundation is more limited than donations for a public charity.



To apply for tax-exempt status under Section 501(c)(3), most nonprofit organizations are required to file Form 1023 or Form 1023-EZ within 27 months from their date of incorporation. The charitable organization must include its articles of incorporation and provide documents that prove that the organization is only operating for exempt purposes.



However, not all organizations that qualify for the tax category need to submit Form 1023. For example, public charities that earn less than $5,000 in revenue per year are exempt from filing this form. Even though it is not required, they may still choose to file the form to ensure that donations made to their organization will be tax deductible for donors.


   Advantages and Disadvantages of a 501(c)(3) Organization  

The 501(c)(3) status offers a myriad of benefits to the designated organizations and the people they serve. For starters, 501(c)(3) organizations are exempt from paying federal income and unemployment taxes, and patrons who donate to them are allowed to claim a tax deduction for their contributions.



To help with funding and further their mission, these organizations are eligible to receive government and private grants. To qualify, the organization must have a mission aligned with the purpose of the grant and a need for it. In addition, 501(c)(3) organizations often receive discounts from retailers, free advertising by way of public service announcements, and food and supplies from other nonprofit organizations designed to help in times of need.



A 501(c)(3) could be the lifelong dream of its founder; however, once established as a 501(c)(3), it no longer belongs to its founder. Rather, it is a mission-oriented organization belonging to the public. To maintain its favorable tax treatment, it must operate within the confines of the law pertaining to 501(c)(3) organizations.



Because the organization serves the public, it must operate with full transparency. Therefore, its finances, including salaries, are available to members of the public and subject to their review.





Pros

Exempt from federal taxes
Contributions are tax deductible
Eligible for government and private grants



Cons

Does not belong to those who created it
Restricted to specific operations to receive tax exemptions
Financial information is publicly accessible





   Example of a 501(c)(3) Organization  

The American Red Cross, established in 1881 and congressionally chartered in 1900, is one of the United States’ oldest nonprofit organizations. Its mission statement says that the Red Cross “prevents and alleviates human suffering in the face of emergencies by mobilizing the power of volunteers and the generosity of donors.” Since its inception, its goal has been to serve members of the armed forces and provide aid during disasters.



Located in 191 countries, the Red Cross operates the largest network of volunteers in the world. This 501(c)(3) organization is segmented into three divisions: the National Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, and the International Committee of the Red Cross.



The National Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, which include the American Red Cross, aim to relieve human suffering globally by empowering subordinate organizations to operate within their nation’s borders to provide disaster relief, education, and other related services. The International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies provides global humanitarian aid during peacetime, such as assisting refugees. The International Committee of the Red Cross provides humanitarian relief for people affected by war or other armed conflicts.



People who itemize their tax deductions can contribute to the Red Cross and claim the amount donated as a deduction. Taxpayers who use the standard deduction may still claim up to $600 of their 501(c)(3) contributions as a tax deduction in 2021.




How Do You Start a 501(c)(3)?
To create a 501(c)(3), you must define the type of organization and its purpose or mission. Before selecting a name, search to ensure that it is not taken. If available, secure the name by registering it with your state. Otherwise, secure the name when filing the articles of incorporation. The articles of incorporation must be filed with the state in which it will be organized and according to the state's rules for nonprofit organizations.After filing, apply for the 501(c)(3) IRS exemption (Form 1023) and state tax exemption for nonprofit organizations. Upon completion, create your organization’s bylaws, which specify how the organization will be structured and governed. Finally, appoint and meet with your board of directors.




How Much Does It Cost to Start a 501(c)(3)?
The costs associated with creating a 501(c)(3) vary according to the needs of the organization. However, some costs can be approximated. For example, filing the articles of incorporation with the state typically costs about $100. The IRS Form 1023 filing fee is $600. However, for organizations that expect less than $50,000 in annual earnings, Form 1023 EZ can be filed for $275.




How Long Does It Take to Get a 501(c)(3) Determination Letter?
A determination letter is sent after applying for the 501(c)(3) exemption. The IRS will only say that “applications are processed as quickly as possible” and “are processed in the order received by the IRS.” However, it does provide a list of 10 tips that can shorten the process.Anecdotally, the website BoardEffect, which offers software designed “to make the work of their boards of directors easier, more efficient and more effective,” says it can take as little as two to four weeks if you can file Form 1023-EZ. However, those who must (or choose) to file Form 1023 will likely wait for anywhere from three to six months to get their letter, while in some cases the wait can be as long as a year.




Do You Need to Be a Corporation to Get a 501(c)(3)?
According to the IRS, to qualify for the 501(c)(3) status, the organization must be formed “as a trust, a corporation, or an association.”




What Is the Difference Between a 501(c)(3) and a 501(c)(4)?
A 501(c)(3) organization is a nonprofit organization established exclusively for one of the following purposes: charitable, religious, educational, scientific, literary, testing for public safety, fostering national or international amateur sports competition, or preventing cruelty to children or animals. These organizations are mostly prohibited from engaging in lobbying. Alternatively, 501(c)(4) organizations, which are also nonprofit, are social welfare groups and allowed to engage in lobbying.


   The Bottom Line  

501(c)(3) organizations are nonprofit groups with a dedicated mission. Most people are familiar with them as churches and charities, but they also include private foundations. As long as they operate to support their mission, they receive favorable tax treatment, such as avoiding federal income and unemployment taxes.
What Is 501(c)?  

501(c) is a designation under the United States Internal Revenue Code (IRC) that confers tax-exempt status on nonprofit organizations. Specifically, it identifies which nonprofit organizations are exempt from paying federal income tax.



The government offers this tax break to promote the presence of organizations that exist purely for the public good and help them stay afloat. Common tax-exempt organizations include charities, government entities, advocacy groups, educational and artistic groups, and religious entities. 





Key Takeaways

Section 501(c) of the Internal Revenue Code designates certain types of organizations as tax-exempt—they pay no federal income tax.Common tax-exempt organizations include charities, government entities, advocacy groups, educational and artistic groups, and religious entities. The 501(c)(3) organization is probably the most familiar entity.Donations to certain qualified tax-exempt organizations may be deductible from a taxpayer's income.


   Types of 501(c) Organizations  

Under subsection 501(c), there are multiple sections that delineate the different types of tax-exempt organizations, according to their purpose and operations.



The most common include:



501(c)(1): Any corporation that is organized under an act of Congress that is exempt from federal income tax
501(c)(2): Corporations that hold a title of property for exempt organizations
501(c)(3): Corporations, funds, or foundations that operate for religious, charitable, scientific, literary, or educational purposes
501(c)(4): Nonprofit organizations that promote social welfare
501(c)(5): Labor, agricultural, or horticultural associations
501(c)(6): Business leagues, chambers of commerce, etc., that are not organized for profit
501(c)(7): Recreational organizations






Groups that might fit the designated categories must still apply for classification as 501(c) organizations and meet all of the stipulations required by the IRS. Tax exemption is not automatic, regardless of the nature of the organization.


   501(c)(3) Organizations  

The 501(c)(3) organization is probably the most familiar tax category outlined in Section 501(c)(3) of the IRC. It covers the sort of nonprofits that people commonly come into contact with, and donate money to (see Special Considerations, below).



In general, there are three types of entities that are eligible for 501(c)(3) status: charitable organizations, churches/religious entities, and private foundations. 


   Other Types of 501(c) Organizations  

The 501(c) designation has expanded over time to encompass more types of organizations.



Other organizations that qualify for listing under this designation can potentially include:



Fraternal beneficiary societies that operate under the lodge system and provide for the payment of life, illness, and other benefits for their members and dependents
Teacher's retirement fund associations, so long as they are local in nature and none of their net earnings grow for the benefit of a private shareholder
Benevolent life insurance associations that are local
Certain mutual cooperative electric and telephone companies
Nonprofit, co-op health insurers
Cemetery companies that are owned and operated for the exclusive benefit of their members or are not operated for profit
Credit unions that do not have capital stock organized
Insurers—aside from life insurance companies—with gross receipts that are less than $600,000
A variety of trusts for such purposes as providing supplement unemployment benefits and pensions
Organizations whose membership is made up of current and former members of the armed forces of the United States or their spouses, widows, descendants, and auxiliary units in their support






Tax-exempt organizations must file certain documents to maintain their status, as explained in IRS Publication 557.


   Tax-Deductible Donations to 501(c) Organizations  

In addition to being tax-exempt themselves, 501(c) organizations offer a tax advantage to others: A portion of donations they receive may be deductible from a taxpayer's adjusted gross income (AGI). Organizations falling under section 501(c)(3)—which are primarily charities and educational or social-welfare-orientated nonprofits—are often qualified to offer this benefit to donors.



In general, an individual who itemizes deductions on their tax return may deduct contributions to most charitable organizations up to 50% (60% for cash contributions) of their AGI computed without regard to net operating loss carrybacks. Individuals generally may deduct charitable contributions to other organizations up to 30% of their AGI.






The IRS offers an exempt organization database that allows you to check an organization's status.



A charity or nonprofit must have 501(c)3 status if you plan to deduct your donation to it on your federal tax return. The organization itself can often tell you which sorts of donations are deductible, and to what extent—for example, if you buy a one-year museum membership for $100, $50 might be deductible.




What Is the Meaning of 501(c) Organization?
If an organization is labeled 501(c), it means it is a nonprofit organization concerned with providing a public benefit and is exempt from paying federal income taxes. The 501(c) designation encompasses many types of organizations, including charities, government entities, advocacy groups, educational and artistic groups, and religious entities. 




What Is the Difference Between a 501(c) and a 501(c)(3)?
501(c) and 501(c)(3) are two different tax categories in the Internal Revenue Code. Both are nonprofit organizations exempt from federal income tax. However, a 501(c)(3)—which consists of charitable organizations, churches/religious entities, and private foundations—can also tell its donors that they can deduct their contributions on their tax returns.




What Are the Types of Nonprofits?
The IRS has issued a long list of the type of nonprofit organizations that can qualify for 501(c) status. Common examples include charitable organizations, churches and religious organizations, social advocacy groups, and trade organizations.


   The Bottom Line  

Organizations that are formed strictly to help the public and not primarily to make a profit, as is the case with most businesses, are an important presence in society. The U.S. government rewards these entities with a 501(c) designation and tax-exempt status because they reduce the burden on the state and improve the lives of the population.



We aren’t just talking about charities here, either. The IRS recognizes dozens of different types of nonprofit organizations as 501(c)s, including some credit unions and insurers.
What Is a 51% Attack?  

A 51% attack is an attack on a cryptocurrency blockchain by a group of miners who control more than 50% of the network's mining hash rate. Owning 51% of the nodes on the network theoretically gives the controlling parties the power to alter the blockchain.



The attackers would be able to prevent new transactions from gaining confirmations, allowing them to halt payments between some or all users. They would also be able to reverse transactions that were completed while they were in control. Reversing transactions could allow them to double-spend coins, one of the issues consensus mechanisms like proof-of-work were created to prevent.





Key Takeaways

Blockchains are distributed ledgers that record every transaction made on a cryptocurrency's network.A 51% attack is an attack on a blockchain by a group of miners who control more than 50% of the network's mining hash rate.Attackers with majority network control can interrupt the recording of new blocks by preventing other miners from completing blocks.Changing historical blocks is impossible due to the chain of information stored in Bitcoin's blockchain.Although a successful attack on Bitcoin or Ethereum is unlikely, smaller networks are frequent targets for 51% attacks.


   Understanding a 51% Attack  

A blockchain is a distributed ledger—essentially a database—that records transactions and information about them and then encrypts the data. The blockchain's network reaches a majority consensus about transactions through a validation process, and the blocks where the information is stored are sealed. The blocks are linked together via cryptographic techniques where previous block information is recorded in each block. This makes the blocks nearly impossible to alter once they are confirmed enough times.



The 51% attack is an attack on the blockchain, where a group controls more than 50% of the hashing power—the computing that solves the cryptographic puzzle—of the network. This group then introduces an altered blockchain to the network at a very specific point in the blockchain, which is theoretically accepted by the network because the attackers would own most of it.



Changing historical blocks—transactions locked in before the start of the attack—would be extremely difficult even in the event of a 51% attack. The further back the transactions are, the more difficult it is to change them. It would be impossible to change transactions before a checkpoint, where transactions become permanent in Bitcoin's blockchain.


  Attacks Are Prohibitively Expensive  

A 51% attack is a very difficult and challenging task on a cryptocurrency with a large participation rate. In most cases, the group of attackers would need to be able to control the necessary 51% and have created an alternate blockchain that can be inserted at the right time. Then, they would need to out-hash the main network. The cost of doing this is one of the most significant factors that prevent a 51% attack.



For example, the most advanced application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) miner is the Bitmain S19 XP Hydro. It costs more than $8,400 (new) and has a hash rate of 257 terahashes per second (TH/s).



On June 7, 2023, the top three mining pools by hashrate were:



FoundryUSA, at 106.16 exahashes per second (EH/s); 29.3% of the total Bitcoin network hashrateAntPool, at 90.28 EH/s; 24.9% of the total Bitcoin network hashrateF2Pool, at 45.98 EH/s; 12.67% of the total network hashrate






Hashing power rental services provide attackers with lower costs, as they only need to rent as much hashing power as they need for the duration of the attack.



Combined, these three pools made up 66.87% of the network hashrate, a whopping 242.42 EH/s (242 million TH/s—the CPU in your computer might be able to hash at at about 15 kilohashes per second). To equal that hashrate, the attackers would need more than 941,634 S19 XP Hydros—which would put fixed costs close to $7.9 billion, plus a building to host the equipment, maintenance staff, electricity, and cooling.



Major cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin, are unlikely to suffer from 51% attacks due to the prohibitive cost of acquiring that much hashing power. For that reason, 51% attacks are generally limited to cryptocurrencies with less participation and hashing power.



After Ethereum's transition to proof-of-stake, a 51% attack on the Ethereum blockchain became even more expensive. To conduct this attack, a user or group would need to own 51% of the staked ETH on the network. It is possible for someone to own that much ETH, but it's unlikely.



According to Beaconchain, more than 19.3 million ETH were staked on June 7, 2023. An entity would need to own more than 9.8 million ETH (more than $18 billion as of June 7, 2023) to attempt an attack.



Once the attack started, the consensus mechanism would likely recognize it and immediately slash the staked ETH, costing the attacker an extraordinary amount of money. Additionally, the community can vote to restore the "honest" chain, so an attacker would lose all of their ETH just to see the damage repaired.


  Attack Timing  

In addition to the costs, a group that attempts to attack the network using a 51% attack must not only control 51% of the network but must also introduce the altered blockchain at a very precise time. Even if they own 51% of the network hashing rate, they still might not be able to keep up with the block creation rate or get their chain inserted before valid new blocks are created by the 'honest' blockchain network.



Again, this is possible on smaller cryptocurrency networks because there is less participation and lower hash rates. Large networks make it nearly impossible to introduce an altered blockchain.






Despite the name, it is not necessary to have 51% of a network's mining power to launch an attack. However, such an attack would have a much lower chance of success.


  Outcome of a Successful Attack  

In the event of a successful attack, the attackers could block other users' transactions or reverse them and spend the same cryptocurrency again. This vulnerability, known as double-spending, is the digital equivalent of a perfect counterfeit. It is also the basic cryptographic hurdle blockchain consensus mechanisms were designed to overcome.



Successful 51% attackers may also implement a Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack, where they block the addresses of other miners for the period they control the network. This keeps the "honest" miners from reacquiring control of the network before the dishonest chain becomes permanent.


   Who Is at Risk of 51% Attack?  

The type of mining equipment is also a factor, as ASIC-secured mining networks are less vulnerable than those that can be mined with GPUs; they are much faster. Cloud services such as NiceHash—which considers itself a "hash-power broker"—theoretically make it possible to launch a 51% attack using only rented hash power, especially against smaller, GPU-only networks.



Bitcoin Gold has been a common target for attackers because it is a smaller cryptocurrency by hashrate. Since June 2019, the Michigan Institute for Technology's Digital Currency Initiative has detected, observed, or been notified of more than 40 51% attacks—also called chain reorganizations, or reorgs—on Bitcoin Gold, Litecoin, and other smaller cryptocurrencies.




What Is a 51% Attack?
A 51% attack is a blockchain restructuring by malicious actors who own more than 51% of a cryptocurrency's total hashing or validating power.




Is a 51% Attack on Bitcoin Possible?
The Bitcoin blockchain could suffer a 51% attack by a very well-funded attacker, but the cost of acquiring enough hashing power to do so generally prevents it from happening.




How Much Bitcoin Is a 51% Attack?
A 51% attack depends on control of mining, not how many bitcoins are held. Attackers would need to control 181 EH/s of hashing power to attack the Bitcoin blockchain as of June 7, 2023. This is more than 941,634 of the most powerful ASIC miners, which have a hashrate per unit of 257 TH/s and cost more than $7.9 billion in equipment only.


   The Bottom Line  

A 51% attack is the unlikely event that a group will acquire more than 50% of the hashing power of a cryptocurrency network. These attacks happen on smaller crypto networks, but tend to fail on larger ones like Bitcoin because they are more secure.
What Is 52-Week High/Low?  

The 52-week high/low is the highest and lowest price at which a security, such as a stock, has traded during the time period that equates to one year.





Key Takeaways

The 52-week high/low is the highest and lowest price at which a security has traded during the time period that equates to one year and is viewed as a technical indicator.The 52-week high/low is based on the daily closing price for the security.Typically, the 52-week high represents a resistance level, while the 52-week low is a support level that traders can use to trigger trading decisions.


   Understanding the 52-Week High/Low  

A 52-week high/low is a technical indicator used by some traders and investors who view these figures as an important factor in the analysis of a stock's current value and as a predictor of its future price movement. An investor may show increased interest in a particular stock as its price nears either the high or the low end of its 52-week price range (the range that exists between the 52-week low and the 52-week high).



The 52-week high/low is based on the daily closing price for the security. Often, a stock may actually breach a 52-week high intraday, but end up closing below the previous 52-week high, thereby going unrecognized. The same applies when a stock makes a new 52-week low during a trading session but fails to close at a new 52-week low. In these cases, the failure to register as having made a new closing 52-week high/low can be very significant.



One way that the 52-week high/low figure is used is to help determine an entry or exit point for a given stock. For example, stock traders may buy a stock when the price exceeds its 52-week high, or sell when the price falls below its 52-week low. The rationale behind this strategy is that if a price breaks out from its 52-week range (either above or below that range), there must be some factor that generated enough momentum to continue the price movement in the same direction. When using this strategy, an investor may utilize stop-orders to initiate new positions or add on to existing positions.



It is not uncommon for the volume of trading of a given stock to spike once it crosses a 52-week barrier. In fact, research has demonstrated this. According to a study called "Volume and Price Patterns Around a Stock's 52-Week Highs and Lows: Theory and Evidence," conducted by economists at Pennsylvania State University, the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and the University of California, Davis in 2008, small stocks crossing their 52-week highs produced 0.6275% excess gains in the following week. Correspondingly, large stocks produced gains of 0.1795% in the following week. Over time, however, the effect of 52-week highs (and lows) became more pronounced for large stocks. On an overall basis, however, these trading ranges had more of an effect on small stocks as opposed to large stocks.


   52-Week High/Low Reversals  

A stock that reaches a 52-week high intraday, but closes negative on the same day, may have topped out. This means that its price may not go much higher in the near term. This can be determined if it forms a daily shooting star, which occurs when a security trades significantly higher than its opening, but declines later in the day to close either below or near its opening price. Often, professionals, and institutions, use 52-week highs as a way of setting take-profit orders as a way of locking in gains. They may also use 52-week lows to determine stop-loss levels as a way to limit their losses.



Given the upward bias inherent in the stock markets, a 52-week high represents bullish sentiment in the market. There are usually plenty of investors prepared to give up some further price appreciation in order to lock in some or all of their gains. Stocks making new 52-week highs are often the most susceptible to profit taking, resulting in pullbacks and trend reversals.



Similarly, when a stock makes a new 52-week low intra-day but fails to register a new closing 52-week low, it may be a sign of a bottom. This can be determined if it forms a daily hammer candlestick, which occurs when a security trades significantly lower than its opening, but rallies later in the day to close either above or near its opening price. This can trigger short-sellers to start buying to cover their positions, and can also encourage bargain hunters to start making moves. Stocks that make five consecutive daily 52-week lows are most susceptible to seeing strong bounces when a daily hammer forms.


   52-Week High/Low Example  

Suppose that stock ABC trades at a peak of $100 and a low of $75 in a year. Then its 52-week high/low price is $100 and $75. Typically, $100 is considered a resistance level while $75 is considered a support level. This means that traders will begin selling the stock once it reaches that level and they will begin purchasing it once it reaches $75. If it does breach either end of the range conclusively, then traders will initiate new long or short positions, depending on whether the 52-week high or 52-week low was breached.
What Is the 52-Week Range?  

The 52-week range is a data point traditionally reported by printed financial news media, but more modernly included in data feeds from financial information sources online. The data point includes the lowest and highest price at which a stock has traded during the previous 52 weeks.



Investors use this information as a proxy for how much fluctuation and risk they may have to endure over the course of a year should they choose to invest in a given stock. Investors can find a stock's 52-week range in a stock's quote summary provided by a broker or financial information website. The visual representation of this data can be observed on a price chart that displays one year's worth of price data.





Key Takeaways

The 52-week range is designated by the highest and lowest published price of a security over the previous year.Analysts use this range to understand volatility.Technical analysts use this range data, combined with trend observations, to get an idea of trading opportunities.


   Understanding the 52-Week Range  

The 52-week range can be a single data point of two numbers: the highest and lowest price for the previous year. But there is much more to the story than these two numbers alone. Visualizing the data in a chart to show the price action for the entire year can provide a much better context for how these numbers are generated.



Since price movement is not always balanced and rarely symmetrical, it is important for an investor to know which number was more recent, the high or the low. Usually an investor will assume the number closest to the current price is the most recent one, but this is not always the case, and not knowing the correct information can make for costly investment decisions.



Two examples of the 52-week range in the following chart show how useful it might be to compare the high and low prices with the larger picture of the price data over the past year.

These examples show virtually the same high and low data points for a 52-week range (set 1 marked in blue lines) and a trend that seems to indicate a short-term downward move ahead.

The overlapping range on the same stock (set 2 marked in red lines) now seems to imply that an upward move may be following at least in the short term. Both of these trends can be seen to play out as expected (though such outcomes are never certain). Technical analysts compare a stock's current trading price and its recent trend to its 52-week range to get a broad sense of how the stock is performing relative to the past 12 months. They also look to see how much the stock's price has fluctuated, and whether such fluctuation is likely to continue or even increase.



The information from the high and low data points may indicate the potential future range of the stock and how volatile its price is, but only the trend and relative strength studies can help a trader or analyst understand the context of those two data points. Most financial websites that quote a stock’s share price also quote its 52-week range. Sites like Yahoo Finance, Finviz.com and StockCharts.com allow investors to scan for stocks trading at their 12-month high or low.


   Current Price Relative to 52-Week Range  

To calculate where a stock is currently trading at in relations to its 52-week high and low, consider the following example:



Suppose over the last year that a stock has traded as high as $100, as low as $50 and is currently trading at $70. This means the stock is trading 30% below its 52-week high (1-(70/100) = 0.30 or 30%) and 40% above its 52-week low ((70/50) – 1 = 0.40 or 40%). These calculations take the difference between the current price and the high or low price over the past 12 months and then convert them to percentages.


   52-Week Range Trading Strategies  

Investors can use a breakout strategy and buy a stock when it trades above its 52-week range, or open a short position when it trades below it. Aggressive traders could place a stop-limit order slightly above or below the 52-week trade to catch the initial breakout. Price often retraces back to the breakout level before resuming its trend; therefore, traders who want to take a more conservative approach may want to wait for a retracement before entering the market to avoid chasing the breakout.



Volume should be steadily increasing when a stock’s price nears the high or low of its 12-month range to show the issue has enough participation to break out to a new level. Trades could use indicators like the on-balance volume (OBV) to track rising volume. The breakout should ideally trade above or below a psychological number also, such as $50 or $100, to help gain the attention of institutional investors.
What Is a 529 Plan?  

A 529 plan is a tax-advantaged savings plan designed to help pay for education. Originally limited to post-secondary education costs, it was expanded to cover K–12 education in 2017 and apprenticeship programs in 2019. After the Setting Every Community Up for Retirement Enhancement Act of 2019 (SECURE Act) and SECURE 2.0 of 2022, 529s can also be used to pay off student loans and fund a Roth IRA.



The two major types of 529 plans are education savings plans and prepaid tuition plans.



Education savings plans grow tax-deferred, and withdrawals are tax-free if they're used for qualified education expenses. Prepaid tuition plans allow the account owner to pay current tuition rates for future attendance at designated colleges and universities. That means that, most likely, you can lock in a lower cost of college attendance.



529 plans are also referred to as qualified tuition programs and Section 529 plans.





Key Takeaways

529 plans are tax-advantaged accounts that can be used to pay educational expenses from kindergarten through graduate school.There are two basic types of 529 plans: educational savings plans and prepaid tuition plans.529 plans are sponsored and run by the 50 states and the District of Columbia. The rules and fees of 529 plans can differ by state.529 plans can be purchased directly from a state or via a broker or financial advisor.Starting on Jan. 1, 2024, up to $35,000 of leftover funds in a 529 account can be rolled over into a Roth IRA account, provided the fund is at least 15 years old.






   Understanding 529 Plans  

Although 529 plans take their name from Section 529 of the federal tax code, the plans themselves are administered by the 50 states and the District of Columbia.



Anyone can open a 529 account, but they are typically established by parents or grandparents on behalf of a child or grandchild, who is the account's beneficiary. In some states, the person who funds the account may be eligible for a state tax deduction for their contributions.



The money in a 529 plan grows on a tax-deferred basis until it is withdrawn. What's more, as long as the money is used for qualified education expenses as defined by the IRS, those withdrawals aren't subject to either state or federal taxes. In addition, some states may offer tax deductions on contributions.



In the case of K–12 students, tax-free withdrawals are limited to $10,000 per year.



Since tax benefits vary depending on the state, it's important that you check the details of any 529 plan to understand the specific tax benefits that you may or may not be entitled to.






   Types of 529 Plans  

The two main types of 529 plans have some significant differences.


  Education Savings Plans  

529 savings plans are the more common type. The account holder contributes money to the plan. That money is invested in a pre-set selection of investment options.



Account-holders can choose the investment (usually mutual funds) that they want to invest in. How those investments perform will determine how much the account value grows over time.



Many 529 plans offer target-date funds, which adjust their assets as the years go by, becoming more conservative as the beneficiary gets closer to college age.



Withdrawals from a 529 savings plan can be used for both college and K–12 qualified expenses. Qualified expenses include tuition, fees, room and board, and related costs.



The SECURE Act of 2019 expanded tax-free 529 plan withdrawals to include registered apprenticeship program expenses and up to $10,000 in student loan debt repayment for both account beneficiaries and their siblings.



And the SECURE Act of 2022, passed as part of the 2023 Omnibus funding bill, will permit rolling over up to $35,000 of unspent funds in a 529 account into a Roth IRA account, starting on Jan. 1, 2024. To qualify, the account must be at least 15 years old.


  Prepaid Tuition Plans  

Prepaid tuition plans are offered by a limited number of states and some higher education institutions. They vary in their specifics, but the general principle is that they allow you to lock in tuition at current rates for a student who may not be attending college for years to come. Prepaid plans are not available for K–12 education.



As with 529 savings plans, prepaid tuition plans grow in value over time. Eventual withdrawals from the account used to pay tuition are not taxable. However, unlike savings plans, prepaid tuition plans do not cover the costs of room and board.



Prepaid tuition plans may place a restriction on which colleges they may be used for. The money in a savings plan, by contrast, can be used at almost any eligible institution.



In addition, the money paid into a prepaid tuition plan isn't guaranteed by the federal government and may not be guaranteed by some states. Be sure you understand all aspects of the prepaid tuition plan.






There are no limits on how much you can contribute to a 529 account each year. However, many states put a cap on how much you can contribute in total. Those limits recently ranged from $235,000 to over $525,000.


   Tax Advantages of 529 Plans  

Withdrawals from a 529 plan are exempt from federal and state income taxes, provided the money is used for qualified educational expenses.



Any other withdrawals are subject to taxes plus a 10% penalty, with exceptions for certain circumstances, such as death or disability.



The money you contribute to a 529 plan isn't tax deductible for federal income tax purposes. However, more than 30 states provide tax deductions or credits of varying amounts for contributions to a 529 plan.



In general, you'll need to invest in your home state's plan if you want a state tax deduction or credit. If you're willing to forgo a tax break, some states will allow you to invest in their plans as a non-resident.

   529 Plan Transferability Rules  

529 plans have specific transferability rules governed by the federal tax code (Section 529). 



The owner (typically you) may transfer to another 529 plan just once per year unless a beneficiary change is involved. You are not required to change plans to change beneficiaries. You may transfer the plan to another family member, who is defined as:



Son, daughter, stepchild, foster child, adopted child, or a descendant of any of themBrother, sister, stepbrother, or stepsisterFather or mother or ancestor of eitherStepfather or stepmotherSon or daughter of a brother or sisterBrother or sister of father or motherSon-in-law, daughter-in-law, father-in-law, mother-in-law, brother-in-law, or sister-in-lawThe spouse of any individual listed aboveFirst cousin






You aren't restricted to investing in your own state's 529 plan, but doing so may get you a tax break. Be sure to check out that plan first.


   Special Considerations  

As with other kinds of investing, the earlier you get started, the better. With a 529 plan, your money will have more time to grow and compound the sooner it's opened and funded.



With a prepaid tuition plan, you'll most likely be able to lock in a lower tuition rate compared to what you'd pay down the road, since many schools raise their prices every year.



If you have money left over in a 529 plan—for instance, if the beneficiary gets a substantial scholarship or decides not to go to college at all—you'll have several options.



One is to change the beneficiary on the account to another relative who qualifies according to the transferability rules. Another is to keep the current beneficiary in case they change their mind about attending college or later go on to graduate school. If all students are done with school, you may use up to $10,000 to pay off federal or private student loans for the beneficiary or their siblings.



A fourth option, starting in Jan. 2024, is to transfer unspent funds to a Roth IRA account if your account meets the requirements for doing so. Finally, you can always cash in the account and pay the taxes and 10% penalty.




How Much Does a 529 Plan Cost?
States often charge an annual maintenance fee for a 529 plan. These have ranged from as little as $0 to $25. In addition, if you bought your 529 plan through a broker or advisor, they may charge you as much as 5% or more on the assets under management. The individual investments and funds that you have inside of your 529 may also charge ongoing fees. Look for low-cost mutual funds and ETFs to keep management fees low.




Who Maintains Control Over a 529 Plan?
A 529 plan is technically a custodial account. So, an adult custodian will control the funds for the benefit of a minor. The beneficiary can assume control over the 529 once they reach age 18. However, the funds must still be used for qualifying education expenses.




What Are Qualified Expenses for a 529 Plan?
Qualified expenses for a 529 plan include:College, graduate, or vocational school tuition and feesElementary or secondary school (K–12) tuition and feesBooks and school suppliesStudent loan paymentsOff-campus housingCampus food and meal plansComputers, internet, and software used for schoolwork (student attendance required)Special needs and accessibility equipment for students


   The Bottom Line  

Creating a 529 plan gives you a tax-advantaged way to save for educational expenses from kindergarten to graduate school, including apprenticeship programs. Now there is a new option to move up to $35,000 of unspent funds into a Roth IRA account if the 529 account is 15 or more years old. With many options for using your 529 plan, they offer great flexibility and the potential for tax-advantaged growth for your future scholars.

What Are 60-Plus Delinquencies?  

The 60-plus delinquency rate is a metric that is typically used for the housing industry to measure the number of mortgage loans that are more than 60 days past due on their monthly payments. A 60-plus delinquency rate is often expressed as a percentage of a group of loans that have been underwritten within a specified time period, such as one year.





Key Takeaways

The 60-plus delinquency rate is a metric typically used to measure the number of mortgage loans that are more than 60 days past due on their monthly payments.A 60-plus delinquency rate is often expressed as a percentage of a group of loans that have been underwritten within a specified time period, such as one year.The 60-plus delinquency rate is helpful because it shows lenders the consumers who might default on their loans.


   Understanding 60-Plus Delinquencies  

The 60-plus delinquency metric can also be used for auto loans and credit cards. The 60-plus delinquency rate is helpful because it shows creditors and lenders whether consumers are falling behind on their payments and if they’re likely to default on their loans.



The 60-plus rate may be split into prime loans and subprime loans. Subprime loans are for borrowers with a poor credit history. The 60-plus delinquency rate on subprime loans is typically higher than for prime loans. Oftentimes, 60-plus rates are published separately for fixed-rate loans versus adjustable-rate loans, which have a variable rate and might have the option to reset to a fixed rate later in the term.



Monitoring the 60-day rates, as well as other delinquency rates for borrowers, can provide enormous insight into the financial health of consumers in an economy. If economic conditions are favorable, meaning steady economic growth, then delinquency rates tend to fall.



Conversely, as economic conditions deteriorate, unemployment tends to rise as consumers are laid off from their jobs. With less income, it becomes more difficult for consumers to make their mortgage payments, leading to a spike in delinquencies throughout the economy. 



Also, banks and mortgage lenders track delinquency rates since any interruption in mortgage payments represents a reduction in revenue. If delinquencies persist in a poorly performing economy, bank losses can rise as fewer mortgage payments are received, which leads to fewer new loans being issued. Fewer loans being issued to consumers and businesses can exacerbate the already-poor conditions within an economy, making a recovery more challenging.


   60-Plus Delinquencies vs. Foreclosure  

The 60-plus delinquency rate is often added to another negative event measure: the foreclosure rate for the same group of loans. The two metrics provide a cumulative measure of the individual mortgages that are either not being paid or being paid behind schedule.



Since 60-plus delinquencies are less than 90 days, the loans have yet to enter the foreclosure process. Foreclosure is the legal process in which a bank seizes a home due to default or nonpayment of the mortgage payments by the borrower. Although each lender may differ, typically 90 to 120 days past due, a home loan enters the pre-foreclosure process.



When a borrower is 90 days past due, the lender usually files a notice of default, which is a public notice submitted to the local court stating that the borrower’s mortgage loan is in default. Borrowers can still try to work with their bank to modify the loan at this point in the process.



If the loan payments are still not made beyond the 90- to 120-day period, then the foreclosure process moves forward. The bank will eventually seize the home, and an auction will be held to sell the home to another buyer.






The 60-plus delinquency rate is a critical early-warning metric for lenders to monitor, providing time for the bank to contact the borrower and work out a payment plan to prevent the loan from going into pre-foreclosure.


  Mortgage-Backed Securities (MBS)  

Mortgage loans are sometimes grouped into a pool of loans that make up mortgage-backed securities (MBS). An MBS is sold to investors as a fund in which they earn interest from the mortgage loans. Unfortunately, investors often have no idea whether the loans that comprise the MBS are current—meaning that the borrowers are not behind on their payments.



If the delinquency rate on past-due mortgages rises beyond a certain level, then the mortgage-backed security may experience a shortfall of cash, leading to difficulty making the interest payments to investors. As a result, a re-pricing of the loan assets can occur, resulting in some investors losing a portion or most of their invested capital.


   Special Considerations  

Homeowners are usually at risk of losing their homes in an economic downturn. But certain protections were put in place to help homeowners affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2020, Congress passed the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act, which included a provision that allowed borrowers to skip their mortgage payments for up to a year—a process called forbearance. It also provided a moratorium on evictions.



The moratorium on foreclosures and evictions for enterprise-backed mortgages, including those backed by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the Federal Housing Administration (FHA), has been extended several times. The forbearance expires on Sept. 30, 2021.



The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) announced a temporary halt on evictions in counties with substantial or high levels of community transmission of COVID-19. The mandate was set to expire on Oct. 3, 2021, but a U.S. Supreme Court ruling ended this protection on Aug. 26, 2021, by striking down the moratorium.



Below are some of the steps and key portions of your rights under the forbearance program that borrowers can opt into if they’re delinquent on their mortgage payments.


  Call Your Lender  

Borrowers must contact their lender or bank that issued the mortgage loan and request forbearance. Borrowers mustn’t stop their mortgage payments until they are approved for forbearance from the lender.


  You Still Owe the Payments  

If approved, forbearance will cause any of your skipped payments to be added to the end of the loan’s term, meaning that the length of the loan will increase. In other words, borrowers still need to make those payments, but instead of making the payments in the next few months, those payments will be added to the end of the payment schedule for the mortgage.


  No Penalties  

The good news is that there are no penalties for delaying the payments as a result of forbearance. Also, the missed payments won’t hurt your credit score, which is a numeric representation of your creditworthiness and ability to pay back your debt.


  Qualifications  

Not all mortgage loans qualify. The program typically limits approval to mortgages that are backed or funded by government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs), such as Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac. As a result, it’s important to contact your lender to see what type of mortgage you have. As mentioned above, the emergency measures signed during the COVID-19 pandemic affect mortgages backed by agencies such as the USDA and the FHA.


   Example of 60-day Mortgage Delinquencies  

The Mortgage Bankers Association (MBA) tracks mortgage delinquency rates for the U.S. economy. The mortgage delinquency rate peaked at 8.22% in the second quarter (Q2) of 2020 but fell to 6.38% within three quarters as of the first quarter (Q1) of 2021. This was the sharpest decline ever seen in such a short period of time. For Q1 2021, the earliest stage delinquencies—the 30-day and 60-day delinquencies combined—dropped to the lowest levels since the inception of the survey in 1979.



FHA-backed mortgage loans had the highest delinquency rate in Q1 2021 of all loan types, at 14.67%. The report notes that while many areas saw improvement from their mid-pandemic highs, delinquency rates as a whole are still higher than they were pre-pandemic.
What Is an 8-K?  

An 8-K is a report of unscheduled material events or corporate changes at a company that could be of importance to the shareholders or the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Also known as a Form 8K, the report notifies the public of events, including acquisitions, bankruptcy, the resignation of directors, or changes in the fiscal year.





Key Takeaways

The SEC requires companies to file an 8-K to announce significant events relevant to shareholders.Companies have four business days to file an 8-K for most specified items.Public companies use Form 8-K as needed, unlike some other forms that must be filed annually or quarterly.Form 8-K is a valuable source of complete and unfiltered information for investors and researchers.


   Understanding Form 8-K  

An 8-K is required to announce significant events relevant to shareholders. Companies usually have four business days to file an 8-K for most specified items.






Investors can count on the information in an 8-K to be timely.



Documents fulfilling Regulation Fair Disclosure (Reg FD) requirements may be due before four business days have passed. An organization must determine if the information is material and submit the report to the SEC. The SEC makes the reports available through the Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval (EDGAR) platform.



The SEC outlines the various situations that require Form 8-K. There are nine sections within the Investor Bulletin. Each of these sections may have anywhere from one to eight subsections. The most recent permanent change to Form 8-K disclosure rules occurred in 2004.


   Benefits of Form 8-K  

First and foremost, Form 8-K provides investors with timely notification of significant changes at listed companies. Many of these changes are defined explicitly by the SEC. In contrast, others are simply events that firms consider to be sufficiently noteworthy. In any case, the form provides a way for firms to communicate directly with investors. The information provided is not filtered or altered by media organizations in any way. Furthermore, investors do not have to watch TV programs, subscribe to magazines, or even wade through financial news websites to get the 8-K.



Form 8-K also provides substantial benefits to listed companies. By filing an 8-K in a timely fashion, the firm's management can meet specific disclosure requirements and avoid insider trading allegations. Companies may also use Form 8-K to notify investors of any events that they consider to be important.



Finally, Form 8-K provides a valuable record for economic researchers. For example, academics might wonder what influence various events have on stock prices. It is possible to estimate the impact of these events using regressions, but researchers need reliable data. Because 8-K disclosures are legally required, they provide a complete record and prevent sample selection bias.


   Criticism of Form 8-K  

Like any legally required paperwork, Form 8-K imposes costs on businesses. There is the cost of preparing and submitting the forms, as well as possible penalties for failing to file on time. Although it is only one small part of the problem, the need to file Form 8-K also deters small companies from going public in the first place. Requiring companies to provide information helps investors make better choices. However, it can reduce their investment options when the burden on businesses becomes too high.


   Requirements for Form 8-K  

The SEC requires disclosure for numerous changes relating to a registrant's business and operations. Changes to a material definitive agreement or the bankruptcy of an entity must be reported. Other financial information disclosure requirements include the completion of an acquisition, changes in the firm's financial condition, disposal activities, and substantial impairments. The SEC mandates filing an 8-K for the delisting of a stock, failure to meet listing standards, unregistered sales of securities, and material modifications to shareholder rights.﻿﻿



An 8-K is required when a business changes accounting firms used for certification. Changes in corporate governance, such as control of the registrant or amendments to articles of incorporation, need to be reported. Changes in the fiscal year and modifications of the registrant's code of ethics must also be disclosed.﻿﻿



The SEC also requires a report upon the election, appointment, or departure of a director or specific officers. Form 8-K must be used to report changes related to asset-backed securities. The form may also be used to meet Regulation Fair Disclosure requirements.﻿﻿



Form 8-K reports may be issued based on other events up to the company's discretion that the registrant considers to be of importance to shareholders.﻿﻿
What Is an 80-10-10 Mortgage?  

An 80-10-10 mortgage is a loan where first and second mortgages are obtained simultaneously. The first mortgage lien is taken with an 80% loan-to-value (LTV) ratio, meaning that it is 80% of the home’s cost; the second mortgage lien has a 10% LTV ratio, and the borrower makes a 10% down payment.



This arrangement can be contrasted with the traditional single mortgage with a down payment amount of 20%.



The 80-10-10 mortgage is a type of piggyback mortgage.





Key Takeaways

An 80-10-10 mortgage is structured with two mortgages: the first being a fixed-rate loan at 80% of the home’s cost; the second being 10% as a home equity loan; and the remaining 10% as a cash down payment.This type of mortgage scheme reduces the down payment of a home without having to pay private mortgage insurance (PMI), helping borrowers obtain a home more easily with the up-front costs.However, borrowers will face relatively larger monthly mortgage payments and may see higher payments due on the adjustable loan if interest rates increase.


   Understanding an 80-10-10 Mortgage  

​​​​​​​When a prospective homeowner buys a home with less than the standard 20% down payment, they are required to pay private mortgage insurance (PMI). PMI is insurance that protects the financial institution lending the money against the risk of the borrower defaulting on a loan. An 80-10-10 mortgage is frequently used by borrowers to avoid paying PMI, which would make a homeowner’s monthly payment higher.



In general, 80-10-10 mortgages tend to be popular at times when home prices are accelerating. As homes become less affordable, making a 20% down payment of cash might be difficult for an individual. Piggyback mortgages allow buyers to borrow more money than their down payment might suggest.



The first mortgage of an 80-10-10 mortgage is usually always a fixed-rate mortgage. The second mortgage is usually an adjustable-rate mortgage, such as a home equity loan or home equity line of credit (HELOC).


   Benefits of an 80-10-10 Mortgage  

The second mortgage functions like a credit card, but with a lower interest rate since the equity in the home will back it. As such, it only incurs interest when you use it. This means that you can pay off the home equity loan or HELOC in full or in part and eliminate interest payments on those funds. Moreover, once settled, the HELOC remains. This credit line can act as an emergency pool for other expenses, such as home renovations or even education.



An 80-10-10 loan is a good option for people who are trying to buy a home but have not yet sold their existing home. In that scenario, they would use the HELOC to cover a portion of the down payment on the new home. They would pay off the HELOC when the old home sells.



HELOC interest rates are higher than those for conventional mortgages, which will somewhat offset the savings gained by having an 80% mortgage. If you intend to pay off the HELOC within a few years, this may not be a problem.



When home prices are rising, your equity will increase along with your home’s value. But in a housing market downturn, you could be left dangerously underwater with a home that’s worth less than you owe.


   Example of an 80-10-10 Mortgage  

The Doe family wants to purchase a home for $300,000, and they have a down payment of $30,000, which is 10% of the total home’s value. With a conventional 90% mortgage, they will need to pay PMI on top of the monthly mortgage payments. Also, a 90% mortgage will generally carry a higher interest rate. 



Instead, the Doe family can take out an 80% mortgage for $240,000, possibly at a lower interest rate, and avoid the need for PMI. At the same time, they would take out a second 10% mortgage of $30,000. This most likely would be a HELOC. The down payment will still be 10%, but the family will avoid PMI costs, get a better interest rate, and thus have lower monthly payments.
What Is the 80-20 Rule?  

The 80-20 rule, also known as the Pareto Principle, is a familiar saying that asserts that 80% of outcomes (or outputs) result from 20% of all causes (or inputs) for any given event.



In business, a goal of the 80-20 rule is to identify inputs that are potentially the most productive and make them the priority. For instance, once managers identify factors that are critical to their company's success, they should give those factors the most focus.



Although the 80-20 rule is frequently used in business and economics, you can apply the concept to any field. Wealth distribution, personal finance, spending habits, and even infidelity in personal relationships can all be the subject of the 80-20 rule.





Key Takeaways

The 80-20 rule maintains that 80% of outcomes comes from 20% of causes.The 80-20 rule prioritizes the 20% of factors that will produce the best results.A principle of the 80-20 rule is to identify an entity's best assets and use them efficiently to create maximum value.This rule is a precept, not a hard-and-fast mathematical law.People sometimes mistakenly conclude that if 20% of factors should get priority, then the other 80% can be ignored.

   How Does the 80-20 Rule Work?  

You may think of the 80-20 rule as simple cause and effect: 80% of outcomes (outputs) come from 20% of causes (inputs). The rule is often used to point out that 80% of a company's revenue is generated by 20% of its customers.



Viewed in this way, it might be advantageous for a company to focus on the 20% of clients that are responsible for 80% of revenues and market specifically to them. By doing so, the company may retain those clients, and acquire new clients with similar characteristics. However, there's a more fundamental meaning to the 80-20 rule.


  Core Principle  

At its core, the 80-20 rule is about identifying an entity's best assets and using them efficiently to create maximum value. For example, a student should try to identify which parts of a textbook will create the most benefit for an upcoming exam and focus on those first. This does not imply, however, that the student should ignore the other parts of the textbook.


  Misinterpretations  

People may not realize that the 80-20 rule is a precept, not a hard-and-fast mathematical law. Furthermore, it is isn't necessary that the percentages equal 100%. Inputs and outputs simply represent different units. The percentages of these units don't have to add up to 100%. It's the concept behind the rule that matters.



There's another way in which the 80-20 rule is misinterpreted. Namely, that if 20% of inputs are most important, then the other 80% must not be important. This is a logical fallacy. The 80% can be important, even if the decision is made to prioritize the 20%.






Business managers from all industries use the 80-20 rule to help narrow their focus and identify those issues that cause the most problems in their departments and organizations.


   80-20 Rule Background  

The 80-20 rule is also known as the Pareto principle and is applied in Pareto analysis. It was first used in macroeconomics to describe the distribution of wealth in Italy in the early 20th century. It was introduced in 1906 by Italian economist Vilfredo Pareto, who is best known for the concepts of Pareto efficiency.



Pareto noticed that 20% of the pea pods in his garden were responsible for 80% of the peas. Pareto expanded this principle to macroeconomics by showing that 80% of the wealth in Italy was owned by 20% of the population.



In the 1940s, Dr. Joseph Juran, a prominent figure in the field of operations management, applied the 80-20 rule to quality control for business production.



He demonstrated that 80% of product defects were caused by 20% of the problems in production methods. By focusing on and reducing the 20% of production problems, a business could increase the overall quality of its products. Juran referred to this phenomenon as "the vital few and the trivial many."


   Benefits of the 80-20 Rule  

Although there is little scientific analysis that either proves or disproves the 80-20 rule's validity, there is much anecdotal evidence that supports the rule as being essentially valid, if not numerically accurate.



Performance results of salespeople in a wide range of businesses have demonstrated success by incorporating the 80-20 rule. In addition, external consultants who use Six Sigma and other management strategies have incorporated the 80-20 principle in their practices with good results.


   Example of the 80-20 Rule  

A Harvard graduate student, Carla, was working on an assignment for her digital communications class. The project was to create a blog and monitor its success during the course of a semester.



Carla designed, created, and launched the site. Midway through the term, the professor conducted an evaluation of the blogs. Carla's blog, though it had achieved some visibility, generated the least amount of traffic compared with her classmates' blogs.


  Define the Problem  

Carla happened upon an article about the 80-20 rule. It said that you can use this concept in any field. So, Carla began to think about how she might apply the 80-20 rule to her blog project. She thought, "I used a great deal of my time, technical ability, and writing expertise to build this blog. Yet, for all of this expended energy, I am getting very little traffic to the site."



She now understood that even if a piece of content is spectacular, it is worth virtually nothing if no one reads it. Carla deduced that perhaps her marketing of the blog was a greater problem than the blog itself.


  Apply the 80-20 Rule  

To apply the 80-20 rule, Carla decided to assign her 80% to all that went into creating the blog, including its content. Her 20% would be represented by a selection of the blog's visitors.



Using web analytics, Carla focused closely on the blog's traffic. She asked herself:



Which sources comprise the top 20% of traffic to my blog?Who are the top 20% of my audience that I wish to reach?What are the characteristics of this audience as a group?Can I afford to invest more money and effort into satisfying my top 20% readers?In terms of content, which blog posts constitute the top 20% of my best-performing topics?Can I improve upon those topics, and get even more traction from my content than I'm getting now?



Carla analyzed the answers to these questions, and edited her blog accordingly:



She adjusted the blog's design and persona to align with her top 20% target audience (a strategy common in micromarketing).
She rewrote some content to meet her target reader's needs more fully.



Significantly, although her analysis did confirm that the blog's biggest problem was its marketing, Carla did not ignore its content. She remembered the common fallacy cited in the article—if 20% of inputs are most important, then the other 80% must be unimportant—and did not want to make that mistake. She knew it was necessary to address aspects of the content, as well.


  Results  

By applying the 80-20 rule to her blog project, Carla came to understand her audience better and therefore targeted her top 20% of readers more purposefully. She reworked the blog's structure and content based on what she learned, and traffic to her site rose by more than 220%.




What's the 80-20 Rule?
The 80-20 rule is a principle that states 80% of all outcomes are derived from 20% of causes. It's used to determine the factors (typically, in a business situation) that are most responsible for success and then focus on them to improve results. The rule can be applied to circumstances beyond the realm of business, too.




What Does the 80-20 Rule Mean?
At its heart, the 80-20 rule simply underscores the importance of exerting your energy on those aspects of your business—or life, sports activity, musical performance, blog, etc.—that get you the best results. However, it does not mean people should then ignore the areas that are less successful. It's about prioritizing focus and tasks, and then solving problems that reveal themselves due to that focus.




How Do I Use the 80-20 Rule to Invest?
When building a portfolio, you could consider investing in 20% of the stocks in the S&P 500 that have contributed 80% of the market’s returns. Or you might create an 80-20 allocation: 80% of investments could be lower risk index funds while 20% might could be growth funds. Of course, past performance doesn't necessarily correlate with future results. So, be sure to monitor your portfolio's performance to see how well the results match your intent and your goals.
What Is the 83(b) Election?  

The 83(b) election is a provision under the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) that gives an employee, or startup founder, the option to pay taxes on the total fair market value of restricted stock at the time of granting.





Key Takeaways

The 83(b) election is a provision under the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) that gives an employee, or startup founder, the option to pay taxes on the total fair market value of restricted stock at the time of granting.The 83(b) election applies to equity that is subject to vesting.The 83(b) election alerts the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to tax the elector for the ownership at the time of granting, rather than at the time of stock vesting.


   Understanding the 83(b) Election  

The 83(b) election applies to equity that is subject to vesting, and it alerts the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to tax the elector for the ownership at the time of granting, rather than at the time of stock vesting.



The 83(b) election documents must be sent to the IRS within 30 days after the issuing of restricted shares. In addition to notifying the IRS of the election, the recipient of the equity must also submit a copy of the completed election form to their employer.



In effect, an 83(b) election means that you pre-pay your tax liability on a low valuation, assuming the equity value increases in the following years. However, if the value of the company instead declines consistently and continuously, this tax strategy would ultimately mean that you overpaid in taxes by pre-paying on higher equity valuation.



Typically, when a founder or employee receives compensation of equity in a company, the stake is subject to income tax according to its value. The tax liability is based on the fair market value of the equity at the time of the granting or transfer, minus any cost of exercising or buying the equity shares. The tax due must be paid in the actual year the stock is issued or transferred.



However, in many cases, the individual receives equity vesting over several years. Employees may earn company shares as they remain employed over time. In which case, the tax on the equity value is due at the time of vesting. If the company’s value grows over the vesting period, the tax paid during each vested year will also rise in accordance.


   Example of an 83(b) Election  

For example, a co-founder of a company is granted 1 million shares subject to vesting and valued at $0.001 at the time the shares are granted. At this time, the shares are worth the par value of $0.001 x number of shares, or $1,000, which the co-founder pays. The shares represent a 10% ownership of the firm for the co-founder and will be vested over a period of five years, which means that they will receive 200,000 shares every year for five years. In each of the five vested years, they will have to pay tax on the fair market value of the 200,000 shares vested. 



If the total value of the company’s equity increases to $100,000, then the co-founder’s 10% value increases to $10,000 from $1,000. The co-founder's tax liability for year 1 will be deduced from ($10,000 - $1,000) x 20% i.e. in effect, ($100,000 - $10,000) x 10% x 20% = $1,800.



$100,000 is the Year 1 value of the firm$10,000 is the value of the firm at inception or the book value10% is the ownership stake of the co-founder20% represents the 5-year vesting period for the co-founder's 1 million shares (200,000 shares/1 million shares)



If, in year 2, the stock value increases further to $500,000, then the co-founder's taxes will be ($500,000 - $10,000) x 10% x 20% = $9,800. By year 3, the value goes up to $1 million and the tax liability will be assessed from ($1 million - $10,000) x 10% x 20% = $19,800. Of course, if the total value of equity keeps climbing in Year 4 and Year 5, the co-founder’s additional taxable income will also increase for each of the years.



If at a later time, all the shares sell for a profit, the co-founder will be subject to a capital gains tax on their gains from the proceeds of the sale.






For restricted stock, you must file your 83(b) election within 30 days of receiving your shares. For stock options, you must file 83(b) within 30 days of exercising your options.


   83(b) Election Tax Strategy  

The 83(b) election gives the co-founder the option to pay taxes on the equity upfront before the vesting period starts. This tax strategy allows the co-founder to only pay taxes on the fair market value of the shares, minus the cost of exercising the options. If the fair market value of the shares is equal to their strike price, the taxable gain is zero.



The 83(b) election notifies the IRS that the elector has opted to report the difference between the amount paid for the stock and the fair market value of the stock as taxable income. The share value during the 5-year vesting period will not matter as the co-founder won’t pay any additional tax and gets to retain the vested shares. However, if the shares are sold for a profit, a capital gains tax will be applied. 



Following our example above, if the co-founder makes an 83(b) election to pay tax on the value of the stock upon issuance, the tax assessment will be made on the difference between the shares' strike price and their fair market value.



If the stock is sold after, say, ten years for $250,000, the taxable capital gain will be on $249,000 ($250,000 - $1,000 = $249,000).



The 83(b) election makes the most sense when the elector is sure that the value of the shares is going to increase over the coming years. Also, if the amount of income reported is small at the time of granting, an 83(b) election might be beneficial.



In a reverse scenario where the 83(b) election was triggered, and the equity value falls or the company files for bankruptcy, then the taxpayer overpaid in taxes for shares with a lesser or worthless amount. Unfortunately, the IRS does not allow an overpayment claim of taxes under the 83(b) election. For example, consider an employee whose total tax liability upfront after filing for an 83(b) election is $50,000. Since the vested stock proceeds to decline over a 4-year vesting period, they would have been better off without the 83(b) election, paying an annual tax on the reduced value of the vested equity for each of the four years, assuming the decline is significant.



Another instance where an 83(b) election would turn out to be a disadvantage will be if the employee leaves the firm before the vesting period is over. In this case, they would have paid taxes on shares that would never be received. Also, if the amount of reported income is substantial at the time of stock granting, filing for an 83(b) election will not make much sense.




When Is It Beneficial to File 83(b) Election?
An 83(b) election allows for the pre-payment of the tax liability on the total fair market value of the restricted stock at the time of granting. It is beneficial only if the restricted stock's value increases in the subsequent years. Also, if the amount of income reported is small at the time of granting, an 83(b) election might be beneficial.




When Is It Detrimental to File 83(b) Election?
If an 83(b) election was filed with the IRS and the equity value falls or the company files for bankruptcy, then the taxpayer overpaid in taxes for shares with a lesser or worthless amount. Unfortunately, the IRS does not allow an overpayment claim of taxes under the 83(b) election.Another instance is if the employee leaves the firm before the vesting period is over then the filing of 83(b) election would turn out to be a disadvantage as they would have paid taxes on shares they would never receive. Also, if the amount of reported income is substantial at the time of the stock granting, filing for an 83(b) election will not make much sense.




What Is Profits Interest?
Profits interest refers to an equity right based on the future value of a partnership awarded to an individual for their service to the partnership. The award consists of receiving a percentage of profits from a partnership without having to contribute capital. In effect, it is a form of equity compensation and is used as a means of incentivizing employees when monetary compensation may be difficult due to limited funds, such as with a start-up limited liability company (LLC). Usually, this type of worker compensation requires an 83(b) election.


   The Bottom Line  

An 83(b) election allows someone to pay taxes on their stock awards at the time that they are granted, rather than at the time of vesting. This tax law is of particular benefit to startup employees, who may receive a large part of their compensation in the form of restricted stock or stock options. Since startups hope that their share value will increase rapidly, an 83(b) election allows these employees to reduce their tax burden in the long term.



Correction: June 14, 2023—An older version of this article incorrectly stated that someone making an 83(b) election would be taxed according to the cost of exercising their shares. In fact, the tax is based on the difference between the fair market value of the shares and the exercise price.
What is an 8(a) Firm?  

An 8(a) firm is a small business that is owned and operated by socially and economically disadvantaged citizens and that has been accepted into the 8(a) Business Development Program. This program is administered by the Small Business Administration (SBA), the United States agency charged with supporting the growth and development of small businesses.﻿﻿ The 8(a) program is designed to help disadvantaged entrepreneurs get government contracts and access the economic mainstream in America.





Key Takeaways

8(a) firms are small businesses that are owned and controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals.The (8)a Business Development Program is run and administered by the SBA, or Small Business Administration, with the goal of giving a leg up to specially selected small businesses.The 8(a) program helps aspiring entrepreneurs obtain government contracts and also includes mentoring, procurement assistance, training, financial assistance, management assistance, and technical assistance, among other benefits.Applicants go through a rigorous application process for 8(a) status. 8 (a) status lasts up to nine years from when it is granted.


   How 8(a) Firm Status Works  

The 8(a) status is specially granted by the SBA to any small business that qualifies, making it eligible for financial assistance, training, mentoring, and other forms of assistance. In order to qualify for this special status, businesses must be owned and operated by individuals who are considered socially and economically disadvantaged. These individuals may have been subject to racial or ethnic prejudice or cultural bias.



The 8(a) status is outlined specifically in Section 8(a) of the Small Business Act, and is designed to help small, disadvantaged businesses compete in the general market. The federal government has a stated goal of awarding at least 5% of federal contracting dollars every year to these businesses.


   The Purpose of the 8(a) Business Development Program  

One of the main reasons behind the creation of the 8(a) status was to increase business involvement by a broader portion of society. The SBA identifies several groups that are eligible for 8(a) status, including Black Americans, Hispanic Americans, Native Americans, Asian Pacific Americans, and Subcontinent Asian Americans. Someone who is not a member of one of these groups may still get into the program if they can show significant evidence of having been socially disadvantaged—for instance, due to race, ethnic origin, gender, and physical handicap, among other causes.



Through the 8(a) Business Development Program, owners can compete for special contracts, such as sole-source government contracts for which there are no competitive bids, that help level the playing field for their small businesses. These small businesses can use the program to form joint ventures with already-established businesses to form mentor-protégé relationships, as well as for management and technical assistance. Businesses must meet certain requirements to be eligible to be a protégé.


   Qualifications for 8(a) Firm Status  

In order to qualify to become an 8(a) firm under SBA guidelines, a business must meet the following criteria (effective July 15, 2020):



It must be a small business.
It must not have participated in the program before.
At least 51% of the business must be owned and operated by U.S. citizens who are considered economically and socially disadvantaged.
The owner's personal net worth must be no higher than $750,000 
The owner's average adjusted gross income (AGI) must be $350,000 or less.
The owner must have no more than $6 million in assets.
The owner must be of good character.
It must show the potential for success and be able to perform successfully on contracts.



Title 13 Part 124 of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) spells out who qualifies for the 8(a) program as well as what counts as being economically and socially disadvantaged.






Small businesses with 8(a) status can receive sole-source contracts, up to a ceiling of $4 million for goods and services and $6.5 million for manufacturing. 


  The first step: getting certified  

Owners interested in taking part in the program are encouraged to do an on-line training and self-evaluation course through the 8(a) Business Development Suitability Tool. The course helps entrepreneurs determine whether or not their company meets the qualifications for the 8(a) program and if it does not, directs them to an appropriate SBA resource.



Before a firm can participate in the 8(a) program, it must first be certified at certify.SBA.gov. And small businesses that want to use the certification website must have a profile at SAM.gov, which is where companies register to do business with the U.S. government. (Contact your local SBA office if you have questions about applying.) Once you have applied, the administration will send a notification letter explaining whether the business was accepted into the 8(a) program. The certification lasts for nine years—the first four years are considered to be developmental, while the remaining five are deemed to be a transition phase. 



Small businesses that gain 8(a) status are subject to annual reviews in order to keep the designation and their good standing in the program. During these reviews, the business owner has to draw up business plans and undergo systematic evaluations. Entrepreneurs who have secured 8(a) firm status say that the application process can be lengthy and rigorous, having prior experience with government contracts can be helpful, and working hard to take advantage of the program's benefits can make the experience very rewarding.
DEFINITION of 90-Day Letter  

90-Day Letter is an IRS notice stating that there was a discrepancy or error within an individual's taxes and they will be assessed unless petitioned. The taxpayer has 90 days to respond, otherwise the audit deficiencies will result in reassessment. Also known as a Notice of Deficiency. 


   BREAKING DOWN 90-Day Letter  

Once you receive your notice, you have 90 days (150 days if the notice is addressed to a person who is outside the country) from the date of the notice to file a petition with the Tax Court, if you want to challenge the tax the IRS proposed, according to the agency. These notices are usually sent after or audit, in the case of people who fail to file a tax return or who have unreported income.


   What The Notice Means  

If you don't dispute the accuracy of the assessment the Internal Revenue Service has made, you won’t need to amend your tax return unless you have additional income, expenses, or credits that you want to report. In that case, all you need to do is sign Form 5564, Notice of Deficiency and return it to the IRS with a check attached to avoid additional interest and or penalties.﻿﻿



If you agree with the findings but have additional income, expenses, or credits to claim, it will be necessary to amend your original tax return with Form 1040-X.﻿﻿ You can do this through your online tax prep service or your tax professional or fill out the form yourself.



It gets more complicated if you disagree with the IRS findings. If you think the IRS notice is incorrect, incomplete or otherwise mistaken, you can contact them with additional information that will shed light on the case. You have 90 days from the date of the notice to dispute the claim. You can ask the Tax Court to reassess or correct or eliminate the liability proposed by the deficiency notice. During the 90 days and any period the case is being reconsidered the IRS by law can't assess or put your account into collection.﻿﻿



Many taxpayers use a tax professional or attorney to handle the dispute process if the amount in question is significant. 



If you lose the appeal and don't or can't pay, the government can file a federal tax lien against your wages, personal property, or your bank account. This is a claim against the assets, not the seizure of them. That happens when a federal tax levy occurs and the IRS actually seizes your property. Payment plans can also be worked out to avoid liens and seizure.﻿﻿
What Is the 90/10 Strategy?  

Legendary investor Warren Buffett proposed the "90/10" strategy in his 2013 chairman's letter to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders. The strategy calls for putting 90% of one's investment capital into low-cost stock index funds and the remaining 10% in low-risk government bonds.



It differs from many common investing strategies that suggest lower percentages of stocks and higher percentages of bonds, especially as the investor gets older.





Key Takeaways

The 90/10 strategy calls for allocating 90% of your investment capital to low-cost S&P 500 index funds and the remaining 10% to short-term government bonds.Warren Buffett described the strategy in a 2013 letter to his company's shareholders.A 90/10 investing strategy is very aggressive compared to other common asset allocation models and probably not for everyone.

   How the 90/10 Strategy Works  

For decades now, Warren Buffett's annual chairman's letters have been eagerly awaited by his shareholders and countless investors eager to emulate his success. His 2013 letter covered a variety of topics, with a single paragraph devoted to the 90/10 strategy. Nonetheless that was sufficient to bring it to wide attention, which continues to this day. Here is what he had to say:



My money, I should add, is where my mouth is: What I advise here is essentially identical to certain instructions I've laid out in my will. One bequest provides that cash will be delivered to a trustee for my wife's benefit. (I have to use cash for individual bequests, because all of my Berkshire shares will be fully distributed to certain philanthropic organizations over the ten years following the closing of my estate.) My advice to the trustee could not be more simple: Put 10% of the cash in short-term government bonds and 90% in a very low-cost S&P 500 index fund. (I suggest Vanguard's.) I believe the trust's long-term results from this policy will be superior to those attained by most investors—whether pension funds, institutions, or individuals—who employ high-fee managers.


   An Example of the 90/10 Strategy  

An investor with a $100,000 portfolio who wants to employ a 90/10 strategy could invest $90,000 in an S&P 500 index mutual fund or exchange traded fund (ETF), with the remaining $10,000 going toward Treasury bills.



Treasury bills, or T-bills, are short-term debt issued by the federal government with maturities of up to one year. They can be purchased directly from the government, through brokers, or in the form of a mutual fund or an ETF. Like Treasury notes and bonds, which have longer maturities, they are generally considered the safest of all investments.



To calculate the performance of a 90/10 portfolio, you would multiply each portion by its return for the year. For example, if the S&P 500 returned 10% for the year and Treasury bills paid 4%, the calculation would be 0.90 x 10% + 0.10 x 4%, resulting in a 9.4% return overall.





Note

Exchange traded funds, or ETFs, work much like mutual funds but are traded on stock exchanges like stocks.


   Keeping Fees to a Minimum  

One reason Buffett advocates investing through index funds is that they typically have rock-bottom costs. That's because they are passively managed. Rather that employ investment managers to make decisions on which stocks to buy and when to sell them, these funds simply try to replicate a particular stock index like the S&P 500, which is based on the stocks of 500 major U.S. corporations.



In addition, numerous studies have shown that few investment managers can beat the performance of an index in any given year and fewer still can do it year after year.



That doesn't mean all index funds are alike. Some do a better job than others at keeping their costs down. So in choosing among S&P 500 index funds, you should consider both their performance (which is likely to be pretty close) and their annual expense ratios (which may be significantly different). All else being equal, a fund with the lower expense ratio will be a better deal.



In addition, some mutual funds, typically sold through brokers, charge sales commissions, or loads, when you invest. That will immediately take a cut out of your investment. You can avoid commissions by buying no-load funds directly from the fund company or from a discount broker that offers them.


   Criticisms of the 90/10 Strategy  

The primary criticism of a 90% stock and 10% bond allocation is its high risk and potential for extreme volatility. By contrast, another well-known strategy suggests subtracting your age from 110 and putting that percentage into stocks, with the rest going into bonds. At age 40, for example, that would mean 70% stocks, 30% bonds. At age 65, it would be 45% stocks, 55% bonds. (Similar guidelines use 100 or 120 in place of 110.)



With such a heavy concentration in stocks, the 90/10 portfolio is exposed to market fluctuations and can experience significant short-term losses during market downturns. This can be emotionally challenging for investors and may not be suitable for those with a low risk tolerance or a shorter investment horizon.



As financial writer Walter Updegrave put it in a 2018 column, "what I believe is the major question anyone thinking of adopting this strategy needs to resolve before adopting it: Will you be willing, and able, to stick with such an aggressive stocks-bonds mix when the markets are in turmoil or even in the midst of a harrowing tailspin?"



That's an especially pertinent question for anyone nearing, or already in, retirement.




What Are the Advantages of a 90/10 Investment Allocation?
The primary advantage of a 90/10 allocation is the potential for higher long-term returns due to the significant exposure to stocks. This strategy may be suitable for investors with a high risk tolerance and a long investment horizon, such as those saving for a retirement decades in the future.




Is the 90/10 Allocation Suitable for Conservative Investors?
Generally, the 90/10 allocation is considered aggressive and is not suitable for conservative investors. Conservative investors typically prioritize capital preservation over potential growth and may find the strategy too risky or volatile.




How Often Should I Rebalance a 90/10 Investment Portfolio?
Rebalancing should be done periodically, typically annually or when your portfolio deviates significantly from your target allocation. It involves adjusting your holdings to maintain the desired asset allocation (in this case, 90/10 stocks/bonds). Consider setting a threshold where you rebalance regardless of the passage of time; for example, anytime your portfolio drifts above 95% stock or below 85% stock, you rebalance.


   The Bottom Line  

A 90/10 investment allocation is an aggressive strategy most suitable for investors with a high risk tolerance and a long time horizon. While Warren Buffett has an enviable track record as an investor, it probably isn't for everyone.
