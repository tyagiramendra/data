What Is the U-6 (Unemployment) Rate?  

The U-6 (Unemployment) rate measures the percentage of the U.S. labor force that is unemployed, plus those who are underemployed, marginally attached to the workforce, and have given up looking for work. The U-6 rate is considered by many economists to be the most revealing measure of the true state of the nation's employment situation.



Nevertheless, the more widely-reported unemployment number is the U-3, often referred to simply as the unemployment report. The U3 reveals only the number of people who are out of work and have sought work in the past four weeks.



Both numbers are published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS).





Key Takeaways

The U-6 (Unemployment) rate is sometimes called the "real" unemployment rate.The widely-reported official unemployment rate, the U-3, counts only people who are currently unemployed and have looked for work in the past four weeks.The U-6 includes not only the unemployed but the underemployed, the "discouraged" workers who have given up looking for work, and the "marginally attached" who have left the workforce but may return at some point.The U-6 is considered by many economists to be the most revealing measure of a country’s employment situation.Both the U-3 rate and U-6 rate are published by the BLS in the monthly job report, which is used by market watchers to gauge the health of the economy.


   Understanding the U-6 (Unemployment) Rate  

The official unemployment rate used by the U.S. government and published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) is the U-3 rate. This is the percentage of the total labor force that is unemployed and has actively sought employment within the past four weeks.



The portion of the unemployed that has not looked for a job in the past four weeks is defined as "marginally attached" and no longer counted as unemployed.



That marginally attached group includes unemployed people who have unsuccessfully looked for work sometime in the past twelve months. It also includes people who have returned to school or become disabled, in which case they may or may not return to the labor force at some point.


  Composition of the U-6 Rate  

The U-6 rate, on the other hand, factors in this marginally attached percentage of the labor force in its unemployment calculation.



The U-6 rate also includes the underemployed in its metrics. These are people who want full-time jobs but have settled for part-time jobs due to economic conditions. While the U-3 rate considers this category of workers to be employed, the U-6 counts this group as unemployed.



Finally, the U-6 rate includes the "discouraged": Those who want a job but have given up looking.






The BLS publishes six monthly unemployment numbers. The U-3 is the official rate and is most widely quoted. The U-6 is a more comprehensive look at the state of American workers.


   Factors of the U-6 (Unemployment) Rate  

Gallup, the data analytics firm, considers the U-6 rate to be "the real unemployment rate," and maintains that the widely-quoted U-3 rate does not accurately represent the reality of joblessness in America.



Gallup notes that an engineer or any other skilled professional who takes a low-paying part-time job to survive would not be counted in the official unemployment rate, even if they make as little as $20 a week.



In addition, the U-3 rate does not include any workers who are employed but have had their work hours reduced.



All of the above are termed "underemployed," and are included in the U-6 rate.



The U-3 also omits those who are unemployed but have not looked for work in the past four weeks. These are the "discouraged" workers that the U-6 reflects.


  Tracking the U-6  

The St. Louis Fed (FRED) tracks the U-6 rate over time on its website.



Its chart, based on BLS numbers, shows a startling U-6 rate of 22.9% in April 2020, during the first national COVID-19 shutdown. The official U-3 rate at that time was 14.7%. In January 2020, the U-6 rate had been just 6.9%. The official U-3 rate was 3.5%.


   Example of the U-6 (Unemployment) Rate  

To calculate the official unemployment rate, the U-3, the BLS divides the total number of unemployed people by the total number of labor force participants, then multiplies that number by 100.



For example, the June 2019 monthly rate report indicated that the total number of people that were unemployed was 6.0 million and the civilian labor force consisted of 163.0 million people. The U-3 unemployment rate was 3.7% (seasonally adjusted).



In the same January 2022 report, the number of people that were marginally attached to the labor force totaled 1.5 million, while the total number of workers with part-time jobs for economic reasons was 3.7 million. The U-6 unemployment rate was 7.1% (seasonally adjusted).



When calculating the U-6 rate, the marginally attached group is added to both the numerator (total unemployed) and denominator (total labor force). In addition, part-time workers are added to the numerator only, since they have already been included as part of the labor force.



The U-6 rate is considerably higher than the U-3 figure and is arguably a better reflection of the health of the American workforce at the time.






The unemployment rates are not based on the numbers of people who have applied for unemployment. They are based on a survey of households in every region of the U.S.


  The COVID-19 Effect  

Since March 2020, the Bureau of Labor Statistics has added several questions to its Household Survey in order to measure the impact of the coronavirus pandemic on jobs.



Here's some of what it found in January 2022:



15.4% of Americans with jobs teleworked at least part of the time.6 million people were unable to work because their employer closed or lost business due to the pandemic.1.8 million were unable to look for work due to the pandemic.




How Is the U-6 (Unemployment) Rate Calculated?
The unemployment statistics released early each month by the Bureau of Labor Statistics are based on a survey of 60,000 households. That's a total of about 110,000 individuals in about 2,000 geographic areas, urban and rural. The survey is conducted by Census Bureau employees.The calculation is straightforward:The number of people who say they are unemployed but have looked for work in the past month, as a percentage of the total civilian working population, equals the "official" or U-3 unemployment rate.The number of people who are unemployed, under-employed, are unemployed but have given up looking for work, or have temporarily left the workforce, as a percentage of the total civilian working population, equals the "real" or U-6 rate.




Where Can I Find the U-6 (Unemployment) Rate by State?
The BLS publishes annual average unemployment numbers for every state. This report includes the U-6 as well as all of the five other unemployment measures. The numbers for 2022 are posted on the BLS site.The U-3 numbers for the states, but not the U-6 numbers, are posted monthly.




What Are the 6 Unemployment Rates?
The U-1 unemployment rate is only one of six "alternative measures" of labor utilization in the U.S. that are published monthly by the Bureau of Labor Statistics.The alternative measures include:U-1: The percentage of the civilian labor force that has been unemployed for 15 weeks or longer.U-2: The percentage of the civilian labor force that lost jobs or completed temporary jobs.U-3: The percentage of the civilian labor force that is unemployed and has sought work in the past four weeks.U-4: The number of unemployed plus the number of discouraged job-seekers as a percentage of the total labor force.U-5: The total of the unemployed plus discouraged job-seekers plus marginally attached workers, as a percentage of the total labor force.U-6: All of the people counted in U-5 plus those working part-time due to economic conditions, as a percentage of the total labor force.


   The Bottom Line  

The U-3 unemployment rate is reported monthly and is watched and tracked carefully as a key indicator of the health of the U.S. economy.



The U-6 rate offers a broader understanding of the true health of the economy.



How many people are scrambling for part-time jobs because they can't get a full-time position? How many people have given up even trying to get a job? How many have left the workforce, hoping to return when the situation improves?



The U-3 number does not include any of those people, but the U-6 rate does.
What Is a U-Shaped Recovery?  

A U-shaped recovery is a type of economic recession and recovery that resembles a U shape when charted. A U-shaped recovery represents the shape of the chart of certain economic measures, such as employment, gross domestic product (GDP), and industrial output. This shape occurs when the economy experiences a sharp decline in these metrics without a clearly defined trough but instead a period of stagnation followed by a relatively healthy rise back to its previous peak.



A U-shaped recovery is similar to a V-shaped recovery except that the economy spends a longer time slogging along the bottom of the recession rather than immediately rebounding.





Key Takeaways

A U-shaped recovery is so-called because major measures of economic performance take on the shape of the letter "U" during these periods.U-shaped recoveries happen when a recession occurs and the economy does not immediately bounce back, instead tumbling along the bottom for a few quarters.It is similar to a V-shaped recovery but more prolonged.Examples of U-shaped recoveries are the 1973-75 Nixon recession and the 1990-91 recession following the S&L crisis.


   Understanding U-Shaped Recovery  

A U-shaped recovery describes a type of economic recession and recovery that charts a U-shape, established when certain metrics such as employment, GDP, and industrial output sharply decline and then remain depressed typically over a period of 12 to 24 months before they bounce back again. 



A U-shaped rescission features a steep decline in economic output followed by a relatively longer trough than a V-shaped recession, followed by a longer recovery out of that trough. The downturn here is usually deeper and longer than that of a V-shaped recession. In the early stages of a U-shape, economists may wrongly assume that the worst is over and the economy has bottomed out. However, the longer it takes to recover, the more likely the setback will be more severe than originally anticipated. As the recession drags on, companies experience more trouble in paying their bills, and some may have to declare bankruptcy.



During the recovery period, banks are typically reluctant to lend more money to firms, and consumers do not spend freely until they see signs that the economy is recovering, once again increasing consumer confidence. Although spending is a key driver of the economy, it takes time for consumers to feel comfortable once again about spending their money. Businesses must wait for the economic climate to improve before they can bring on additional workers. With fewer jobs available, unemployment tends to increase during such recovery periods.



Meanwhile, a V-shaped recovery may reach the same trough but quickly rebound in a matter of weeks or a few months, rather than dragging out for a year or more.


   Other Common Recession Shapes  

Recession shapes are shorthand concepts used by economists to characterize various types of recessions. Any number of recession and recovery types may conceivably be charted, although the most common shapes include U-shaped, V-shaped, W-shaped, and L-shaped.



V-shaped recessions begin with a steep fall, but they trough and recover quickly. This type of recession tends to be considered a best-case scenario.
W-shaped recessions begin like V-shaped recessions, but they turn down again after false signs of recovery are exhibited. These are also known as double-dip recessions, because the economy drops twice prior to full recovery.
L-shaped recessions are worst-case scenarios, describing recessions that fall quickly but fail to recover.
K-shaped recessions see an uneven recovery as some sectors come back quickly while others lag.


   Examples of U-Shaped Recessions  

Of the U.S. recessions charted since 1945, approximately half have been described by economists as U-shaped, including the 1973-5 recession and the 1990-91 recession.


  1973–1975: Nixonomics, the Gold Window, and Stagflation  

One of the most notable U-shaped recessions in U.S. history was the 1973-75 recession. The economy began to shrink in early 1973 and continued to decline or show only slight growth over the next two years, with the GDP dipping 3% at its deepest point before finally recovering in 1975. The roots of this recession lay in the inflationary policies of the preceding years, simultaneously financing the Vietnam War and the Great Society welfare state expansion under President Johnson, Keynesian deficit spending policies under President Nixon after him, and the resulting break of the last links between the U.S. dollar and gold.



The onset of the recession was marked by the 1973 oil crisis and increased oil prices as well as the 1973–74 stock market crash, one of the worst stock market downturns in modern history, which affected all the major stock markets in the world. The recovery was marked by persistently high unemployment and accelerating inflation that would characterize the 1970s as the era of stagflation.

  1990–1991: The Jobless Recovery  

The deregulation of banks and savings & loans (S&L) in the early 1980s kicked off a boom in commercial and residential real estate lending that really took off as the Fed loosened monetary policy and interest rates fell after the economy emerged from recession in 1982. This boom would build into a debt bubble of risky mortgages and shady banking practices that burst in the late 1980s in a debacle known as the S&L crisis. The resulting massive losses, debt deflation, and bank failures across the real estate and financial sector led to recession for the broader economy in mid-1990. 



Although mild GDP growth reappeared the following year, job losses continued and unemployment rose through mid-1992, and total employment did not regain its pre-recession level until 1993. Because of this, the recovery from the 1900–91 recession has been dubbed the Jobless Recovery, and it can be considered an example of a U-shaped recovery. 




Was the COVID Recession U-Shaped?
Many economists have characterized the economic downturn and recovery following the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic from 2020 to 2021 as K-shaped, whereby certain industries suffered (such as travel and hospitality) while others saw positive growth (such as internet communications and online streaming).




How Is a U-Shaped Recession Different from a V-Shaped Recession?
Both a U- and V-shaped recession features a sharp decline followed by a somewhat symmetrical recovery. The main difference is in how long the economy remains depressed at its trough: a V-shape remains there for only a short period with a quick rebound; a U-shape may remain there for far longer before eventually recovering.




How Long Do Recessions Usually Last?
Since 1857, the U.S. has had 34 recessions, ranging in length from two months (February to April 2020) to more than five years (October 1873 to March 1879). In the six instances since 1980, the average recession lasted less than 10 months.


   The Bottom Line  

A U-shaped recession and recovery is characterized by an initial drop in economic output followed by an extended period of decline and then a slower but eventual economic expansion. In the case of a U-shape, it is sometimes hard to tell if the economy has bottomed out or if things will get worse before they get better. Economists tend to categorize U-shapes into three stages: the recessionary part of the downturn, the economic trough, and the slower but more lasting economic recovery.
What Is an Uberrimae Fidei Contract?  

An uberrimae fidei contract is a legal agreement, common to the insurance industry, requiring the highest standard of good faith during the disclosure of all material facts that could influence the decision of the other party. A failure to adhere to uberrimae fidei is grounds for voiding the agreement. Uberrimae fidei is also known as utmost good faith and is simply the Latin translation of this phrase.





Key Takeaways

An uberrimae fidei contract is a legal agreement, common to the insurance industry, requiring the highest standard of good faith during the disclosure of all material facts that could influence the decision of the other party.Uberrimae fidei or "uberrima fides" literally means "utmost good faith" in Latin.The principles of uberrimae fidei were first expressed by Britain's Lord Mansfield in the case of Carter v Boehm (1766).


   Understanding Uberrimae Fidei Contracts  

Uberrimae fidei or "uberrima fides" literally means "utmost good faith" in Latin. It requires parties to certain contracts to exercise the highest standard of full disclosure of any relevant conditions, circumstances, or risks to their counterparties. Failing to disclose material facts that might influence the other party's decision when entering into a contract where uberrimae fidei applies can result in the contract being rendered null and void and the other party being released from any obligations under the contract.


   Uberrimae Fidei in Insurance Contracts  

Insurance contracts are the most common type of uberrimae fidei contracts. Since the insurance company agrees to share the risk of loss with the policyholder, it is imperative that the policyholder act in good faith by fully disclosing all information that affects the insurance company's level of risk. Full disclosure allows the insurer to protect itself by charging the policyholder a premium that accurately reflects the level of risk it is undertaking or even refusing to issue a policy if the risk is too high.



Standards of disclosure in legal contracts, such as uberrimae fidei, are attempts to resolve economic problems that arise from information asymmetry. Particularly in the case of insurance contracts, the principle of uberrimae fidei is meant to protect the insurer against the problem of adverse selection because it is common for the insurance applicant to have more information about their own characteristics and past behavior with respect to risk that is being insured against than the insurer does.



The potential insured has an obvious incentive to withhold information from the insurer about existing circumstances or past risky behavior that would tend to lead the insurer to demand a higher premium payment (or refuse to insure at all). Uberrimae fidei requires that they disclose this information before they can be insured.



For example, someone applying for life insurance knows more about their eating habits, exercise patterns, risky behaviors, family medical history, and personal medical history than the potential insurer does. In order to determine how risky the applicant is, the insurer requires them to honestly answer a medical questionnaire and submit to a review of medical records before being approved for a policy. If the policyholder is later found to not have acted in utmost good faith at the time of application, the policy and benefits can be rescinded.


   Special Considerations  

Uberrimae fidei is seen as the foundation of a reinsurance contract. In order to make reinsurance affordable, a reinsurer cannot duplicate costly processes, such as insurer underwriting and claim handling costs.



They must rely on the primary insurer’s ability to complete these tasks adequately. In return, a reinsurer must appropriately investigate and reimburse an insurer’s good faith claim payments. Uberrimae fidei is considered an implied term in reinsurance contracts.


   Origin of Uberrimae Fidei  

The principles of uberrimae fidei were first expressed by Britain's Lord Mansfield in the case of Carter v Boehm (1766).



Mansfield said:



"Insurance is a contract of speculation... the special facts, upon which the contingent chance is to be computed, lie most commonly in the knowledge of the insured only. The underwriter trusts to his representation, and proceeds upon confidence that he does not keep back any circumstances in his knowledge, to mislead the underwriter into a belief that the circumstance does not exist... Good faith forbids either party by concealing what he privately knows, to draw the other into a bargain from his ignorance of that fact, and his believing the contrary."




What Is an Example of a Breach of Utmost Good Faith?
An example of a breach of utmost good faith is any time one party in a contract does not disclose all material information; information that would otherwise change the nature of the contract. For example, if you are applying for health insurance and do not disclose that you are a regular smoker, which would increase the risk for the insurance company, this is a breach of utmost good faith.




What Is the Difference Between Caveat Emptor and Uberrimae Fidei?
Uberrimae fidei and caveat emptor are two completely opposing principles: two sides of the coin. While uberrimae fidei implies "utmost good faith," where both parties disclose all information, caveat emptor implies "buyer beware," where all material information is not disclosed and the risk is unknown to the buyer who is solely responsible for uncovering any risks.




What Is the Major Reason for a Breach of Utmost Good Faith?
Reasons for breaches of utmost good faith include withholding relevant information and lying, both of which would void a contract of utmost good faith.


   The Bottom Line  

Prevalent in the insurance industry, an uberrimae fidei contract requires the disclosure of all material information in good faith, which if not done, is grounds for termination of the contract. Uberrimae fidei contracts are particularly important in reinsurance, which is when an insurance company transfers some of its risk to a reinsurance company.
What Is UBS?  

UBS, formerly known as the Union Bank of Switzerland, is a multinational diversified financial services company headquartered in Zurich and Basel. UBS is involved in virtually all major financial activities, including retail and commercial banking, investment banking, investment management, and wealth management.



UBS has a major presence around the globe and in the United States. It has its American headquarters in New York City. It operates in over 50 countries worldwide, with close to 60,000 employees.





Key Takeaways


UBS is a Swiss investment bank with global operations.
In March 2023, UBS (UBS) announced it would absorb Credit Suisse (CS) in a $2 billion all stock deal brokered by the government to prevent the latter embattled bank from failing.
The main divisions of UBS include investment & retail banking and asset & wealth management.
Its retail banking sector facilitates private Swiss bank accounts.
The company has approximately USD $3.2 trillion in assets under management.



   UBS Explained  

The name UBS is derived from one of its predecessor corporations, the Union Bank of Switzerland. The current UBS originated when the Union Bank of Switzerland merged with the Swiss Bank Corporation in 1998. Thus, UBS is now used as the company's official name and not as an acronym.






The UBS logo consists of three keys, a symbol taken from the Swiss Bank Corporation. The keys symbolize confidence, security, and discretion.


   UBS’s Major Divisions  

UBS has several major divisions, offering products and services to numerous clients. These divisions include wealth management, asset management, investment banking, and retail banking.


  Wealth Management  

UBS wealth management covers both high net worth and ultra-high net-worth individuals. The division’s financial advisors work with clients to understand the breadth of their financial and other assets and develop tailored solutions to meet their needs. Financial advisors may specialize in services, such as investment management, income tax preparation, or estate planning.


  Asset Management  

The investment aim of UBS asset management is to “deliver superior investment performance and client service.” Asset management differs from wealth management in that it can also describe managing collective investments (such as a pension fund) in addition to overseeing individual assets. For this reason, some deem asset management to encompass wealth management.






UBS has more than CHF 2.8 trillion in invested assets in 2022 and is the largest bank in Switzerland.


  Investment Banking  

UBS investment bank is considered one of the bulge bracket banks, along with Goldman Sachs, J.P. Morgan, Morgan Stanley, Citigroup, Barclays, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Credit Suisse, and Deutsche Bank.



Investment banks underwrite new debt and equity securities for all types of corporations, aid in the sale of these securities, and help to facilitate mergers and acquisitions, reorganizations, and broker trades for institutions and private investors. At times, investment banks also provide guidance to issuers regarding the issue and placement of stock.


  Retail Banking  

UBS retail banking is what many traditionally view as mass-market banking, wherein individual customers use the local branches of larger commercial banks. Other examples of retail banks include Citibank and T.D. Bank.



UBS retail bank offers savings and checking accounts, mortgages, personal loans, debit or credit cards, and certificates of deposit (CDs). The focus is on the individual consumer.




What Does UBS Stand For?
UBS is the acronym for Union Bank of Switzerland ("Union de Banques Suisses" or "Unione di Banche Svizzere" in French or Italian, respectively. In German, it's "Schweizerische Bankgesellschaft"). When Union Bank merged with Swiss Bank, the new entity took on the name UBS.




Is UBS a US Bank?
While UBS is based in Switzerland, it also operates as a licensed U.S. bank, headquartered in New York City and registered in Utah, known as UBS Bank USA.




What Does UBS Wealth Management Do?
UBS Wealth Management provides a range of financial planning services for individuals and businesses. These include portfolio management, market research, retirement planning, and educational planning.


   The Bottom Line  

UBS is a Swiss investment bank with global operations; it operates in more than 50 countries worldwide, with close to 60,000 employees. Its primary divisions include investment and retail banking, and asset and wealth management. This financial institution has a major presence in the United States, including at its American headquarters in New York City. The main divisions of UBS include investment & retail banking and asset & wealth management.
What Is a UCC-1 Statement?  

A UCC-Uniform Commercial Code-1 statement is a legal notice filed by creditors to publicly declare their rights to potentially obtain the personal properties of debtors who default on business loans they extend. Often abbreviated as UCC-1, these notices are typically printed in local newspapers to alert the masses of the creditors’ intentions.



UCC-1s are required for all business loans under the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) and establish a relative priority over which specific assets may be seized, and in what order, while solidifying the collection pecking order in cases where there are multiple lenders to the same debtor.





Key Takeaways

A UCC-Uniform Commercial Code-1 (UCC-1) statement is a legal notice filed by creditors in an effort to publicly declare their right to seize assets of debtors who default on loans.UCC-1 notices are typically printed in local newspapers, in an effort to publicly express a lender’s intent to seize collateralized assets. These forms are mainly used to smooth out collection processes, often by helping lenders secure court orders authorizing them to seize assets from delinquent borrowers.These forms must be filed with agencies located in the state where the borrower’s business is incorporated.There are two types of UCC-1 statements: blanket liens, and liens attached to specific collateral.


   Understanding UCC-1 Statements  

The UCC-1 statement serves as a lien on secured collateral, where the components and filing procedures are comparable to the lien requirements in residential mortgage loan contracts. The UCC-1 statement is a directive of the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC), which governs business deals and activities in the United States.



According to the ninth article of the UCC, titled “Secured Transactions,” a lender must incorporate completed UCC-1 statements in a business loan’s contract for it to be deemed effective. The statements must include detailed information about the borrower, and they must itemize descriptions of all assets named as the secured collateral for the loan. While virtually any type of asset may serve as such collateral, the most commonly used items include real estate properties, motor vehicles, manufacturing equipment, inventory, and investment securities such as stock and bond holdings.



As with any ordinary lien, lenders must perfect the UCC-1 statement by filing it with the appropriate agency in the state where the debtor company is incorporated. In most cases, UCC-1 statements are filed with the secretary of state’s office, which subsequently time-stamps the document and assigns a file number to the associated parties.






In industry jargon, the process of issuing UCC-1 notices is referred to as “perfecting the security interest” in the debtor’s property.


   Types of UCC-1 Statements  

Lenders have the option of filing the following two types of UCC-1 statements:



Specific collateral UCC-1 statements. These are most commonly used in real estate or equipment transactions. They give lenders first-order secured rights to real estate properties or specific collateral such as the equipment purchased with the loaned funds.
Blanket lien. This gives the lender secured rights to a range of assets, as long as the terms of these liens are detailed in the collateral section of the UCC-1 statement. Lenders tend to prefer blanket or “all-asset” liens.


   How a UCC Filing Affects Credit Scores  

Like individuals, most businesses have a credit report and score. While a UCC lien will appear on a business’ credit report, it won’t necessarily have an immediate negative impact on the business’ credit score, unless the business should default on the underlying loan.



The loan attached to the UCC filing will also increase a business’ credit utilization ratio, which, if it gets too high, can negatively impact the score. Furthermore, the business won’t be able to use the same piece of property as collateral for a different loan if there is a lien attached to it.


   Example of a UCC-1 Statement  

Say a construction company named Alex’s Excavation applies for a business loan to purchase two new hydraulic excavators. Bank XYZ is interested in offering Alex a loan, and as part of the contract, it files a UCC-1. Shortly afterward, Alex’s Excavation loses one of its biggest construction contracts, and then another, and the company is forced to file for bankruptcy.



Because the company had several lenders, it’s likely that Bank XYZ would not be given first-order rights to Alex’s property and would have to wait until all other lenders were paid. However, because the bank filed a specific collateral lien on the two excavators, it received the property/cash mentioned in the UCC-1 statement in a timely fashion.




What are the benefits after filing a UCC-Uniform Commercial Code-1 (UCC-1) statement?
Filing a UCC-1 statement allows creditors to collateralize or “secure” their loan by utilizing the personal property assets of their customers. In the event of a customer defaulting on their loan or filing for bankruptcy, a UCC-1 elevates the lender’s status to a secured creditor, ensuring that it will be paid.




How do you remove a UCC filing?
While rules vary by state, there are essentially two ways to remove a UCC lien:The first is to ask the lender to immediately remove the lien upon full payment of the loan by filing a UCC-3 statement.The other option, if your lender fails to file a UCC-3 after you’ve paid off the loan, is to visit your local secretary of state’s office and swear under oath that you have fulfilled the debt in full and request to have the UCC-1 removed.




How long does a UCC filing last?
A UCC-1 statement is effective for five years. After this five-year period, the lien becomes null and void.




What is a continuation statement?
A continuation statement is an amendment attached to a UCC-1 financing statement. Continuation statements extend the lender’s lien on the borrower’s collateral past the original financing statement’s expiration date. When a lender files a continuation statement, the continuation statement extends the UCC-1 financing statement by five years from the date of filing.


   The Bottom Line  

UCC filings let creditors notify other creditors about a debtor’s assets that are used as collateral for a secured transaction. UCC liens filed with the appropriate secretary of state’s offices serve as public notice of the creditor’s interest in the assets. To check for UCC filings, visit your secretary of state’s website.

What Is UDAAP?  

UDAAP is an acronym that refers to unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or practices by those who offer financial products or services to consumers. UDAAPs are illegal, according to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010. The rules about UDAAPs were created by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). Enforcement is shared by the CFPB and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC).





Key Takeaways

The acronym UDAAP refers to unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or practices by those who offer financial products or services to consumers.Regulators created new laws in the wake of the financial crisis to protect consumers, which included defining and outlawing UDAAPs.Financial product and service providers cannot coerce or deceive consumers into making unwanted purchases and are prohibited from making misleading statements about products and services to consumers.The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has the authority to regulate UDAAPs while the agency shares enforcement responsibilities with the Federal Trade Commission.Regulators evaluate financial products and services for consume harm on a regular basis.


   Understanding UDAAP  

Defining and outlawing UDAAPs were among the many steps that financial regulators took following the financial crisis. It was during this time that financial regulators created new laws and regulations to protect consumers and boost consumer confidence in financial transactions. The most notable piece of legislation was the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act.



An unfair practice is one that harms consumers financially and that consumers cannot reasonably avoid. The harm does not have to involve a large amount of money. Under the law, unfair practices do not benefit consumers or market competition which would make the potential for harm a valid trade-off. Financial product and service providers are not allowed to:



Coerce or deceive consumers into making unwanted purchases
Mislead consumers through specific statements or through a lack of clear and full disclosure



The government does not determine which financial products and services are best for consumers, but it does require that consumers have access to information that lets them choose the best options for their situations. Consumers should only have to take reasonable measures—not impractical or expensive ones—to determine whether purchasing certain financial products or services is in their best interests.






The law generally does not cover emotional harm, except possibly in cases of excessive harassment.


  The Role of the CFPB  

The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has a key role when it comes to UDAAPs. Dodd-Frank gives the agency the authority to make rules about these practices. The act also includes the authority to enforce any actions that prevent the "unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or practices" related to consumer offerings and transactions for financial products and services as long as the entity falls within the CFPB's jurisdiction.


  The Role of the FTC  

The CFPB also grants enforcement authority to the Federal Trade Commission. Just like the other agency, the FTC ensures that financial products and service providers adhere to consumer protection laws by being truthful and ethical in their offerings and practices. As such, it is responsible for investigating complaints, enforcing regulations, and taking any action against entities that violate the law. This includes issuing fines and penalties, and even prosecuting offending service providers.






You can review the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's definition of UDAAPs on its website. If you feel that you've been affected, contact the CFPB or the FTC to file a complaint.


   Examples of UDAAP  

The following are examples of unfair or deceptive practices:



A lender keeping a lien on a house that is fully paid for by a consumer
A credit card company issuing convenience checks to consumers, then refusing to honor them without notifying those consumers
A bank maintaining a relationship with a customer who has repeatedly committed fraud
A car dealership advertising $0 down payment car leases without clearly disclosing the associated fees
A mortgage lender advertising fixed-rate mortgages but only selling adjustable-rate mortgages



Regulators routinely evaluate financial products and services for potential sources of consumer harm.


  Real-World Example  

The CFPB ordered three American Express subsidiaries to refund about $85 million to around 250,000 customers in October 2012. The agency determined the subsidiaries harmed consumers in interactions ranging from advertising credit cards to accepting payments to collecting debts.



The bureau found that consumers were deceived about credit card rebates and about the benefits of paying off old debt. The CFPB also found that some applicants were illegally treated differently based on their age, among other charges.




What Does UDAAP Stand for?
UDAAP is an acronym that stands for unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or practices by the providers of financial products and services. They are illegal as per the Dodd-Frank Act. The law gives authority to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to come up with rules surrounding these illegal acts. The CFPB and the Federal Trade Commission are both tasked with enforcing these regulations to ensure consumers are protected from unscrupulous lenders and financial institutions.




What Constitutes a UDAAP Violation?
There are many examples of unfair or deceptive violations. These include failing to provide customers with promised services, using bait-and-switch tactics, and misleading consumers about costs and prices for products and services, among others.




Who Has the Rulemaking Authority for UDAAPs?
The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act was established following the 2007-2008 financial crisis. Its goal is to protect consumers and boost confidence in the financial system. The act charged the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau with coming up with the rules surrounding UDAAPs. The CFPB and the Federal Trade Commission both enforce the regulations set forth.


   The Bottom Line  

The financial crisis of 2007-2008 brought to light many failures of the financial system. One of these was the lack of transparency and accountability of certain financial institutions. The Dodd-Frank Act helped establish rules to protect consumers and ensure that lenders, banks, and other financial service providers deal with consumers fairly and ethically. Both the CFPB and the FTC are responsible for ensuring that these entities live up to the rules. If you feel that you've been deceived or are the victim of unfair practices, contact the CFPB or FTC and file a complaint.
What Does Ulcer Index Mean?  

The Ulcer Index (UI) is a technical indicator that measures downside risk in terms of both the depth and duration of price declines. The index increases in value as the price moves farther away from a recent high and falls as the price rises to new highs. The indicator is usually calculated over a 14-day period, with the Ulcer Index showing the percentage drawdown a trader can expect from the high over that period.



The greater the value of the Ulcer Index, the longer it takes for a stock to get back to the former high. Simply stated, it is designed as one measure of volatility only on the downside.


   Understanding Ulcer Index (UI)  

The Ulcer Index was developed by Peter Marin and Byron McCann in 1987 for analyzing mutual funds. Marin and McCann first published it in their 1989 book, The Investor's Guide to Fidelity Funds. The indicator looks only at downside risk, not overall volatility. Other volatility measures, like standard deviation, treat up and down movement equally, but a trader typically does not mind upward movement; it is the downside that causes stress and stomach ulcers, as the index's name suggests.


   Calculating the Ulcer Index  

The indicator is calculated in three steps:



Percentage Drawdown = [(Close - 14-period High Close)/14-period High Close] x 100Squared Average = (14-period Sum of Percentage Drawdown Squared)/14 Ulcer Index = Square Root of Squared Average



Which price high is used in the Ulcer Index calculation is determined by adjusting the look-back period. A 14-day Ulcer Index measures declines off of the highest point in the past 14 days. A 50-day Ulcer Index measures declines off of the 50-day high. A longer look-back period provides investors with a more accurate representation of the long-term price declines they may face. A shorter-term look-back period provides traders with a gauge of recent volatility.


   Using the Ulcer Index  

Martin recommends the Ulcer Index as a measure of risk in various contexts where the standard deviation is usually used. The Ulcer Index can also be charted over time and used as a kind of technical analysis indicator, to show stocks going into ulcer-forming territory, or to compare volatility in different stocks.



Investors can use the Ulcer Index to compare different investment options. A lower average Ulcer Index means lower drawdown risk compared with an investment with a higher average UI. Applying a moving average to the Ulcer Index will show which stocks and funds have lower volatility overall.



Watching for spikes in the Ulcer Index that are beyond "normal" can also be used to indicate times of excessive downside risk, which investors may wish to avoid by exiting long positions.

What Is an Ultimate Mortality Table?  

An ultimate mortality table lists the percentage of life insurance purchasers expected to still be alive at each given age, beginning with age 0, which represents 100% of the population, up to age 120. Typically, the data is based on a population of life insurance policyholders from either a particular insurance company or group of them, rather than the entire U.S. population.





Key Takeaways

An ultimate mortality table lists the percentage of life insurance purchasers expected to still be alive at each given age.Typically, the data is based on policyholders from a particular insurance company or group of them, rather than the entire U.S. population.Ultimate mortality tables exclude data from recently underwritten policies because their owners were probably required to pass a medical exam.Insurance companies consult ultimate mortality tables to price their products and determine whether to offer coverage to an applicant.


   Understanding an Ultimate Mortality Table  

Mortality tables are essentially grids of numbers that show the probability of death for members of a given population within a defined period of time, based on a large number of factored variables.



What mainly separates an ultimate mortality table from other mortality tables is its exclusion of recently underwritten policies. The first few years of life insurance data is usually removed from the analysis to eliminate so-called selection effects. The rationale here is that people who just received life insurance will often have passed a medical exam and, as a result, should be statistically healthier and less likely to be on the brink of death than the rest of the general population.





1921

The year Raymond Pearl introduced the world to mortality tables for the purpose of furthering ecological studies.﻿﻿



The information underlying ultimate mortality tables is called survivorship data and takes into account many risk factors. Along with death and survival rates among age groups and sexes, mortality tables may also list survival and death rates in relation to weight, ethnicity, and region. Some break out statistics for smokers and non-smokers, too.



In addition, some might include an aggregate mortality table, featuring death-rate data on the entire study population that has purchased life insurance, without a categorization based on age or time of purchase. The data in an aggregate table depends on the combined statistics of several, if not many, individual mortality tables.


   How an Ultimate Mortality Table Is Used  

Insurance companies use data from ultimate mortality tables to price their products and determine whether to offer coverage to an applicant.



Life insurance guarantees a lump sum payment to named beneficiaries when the policyholder dies, so studying the probability that an applicant might pass away during the period he or she seeks coverage for is essential to ensure the profitability of an insurance company.





Important

The profitability of insurance products partly hinges on companies accurately analyzing the data behind ultimate mortality tables.



To a lesser degree, investment-management companies may also consult ultimate mortality tables to help their customers make determinations about their own respective life expectancies and how much money they might need in retirement.


   Special Considerations  

As is the case for other types of statistical data, the accuracy of ultimate mortality tables depends on the breadth of data in the survey. In other words, an insurance company's ultimate mortality table may not be as precise as one compiled by an organization that's able to compile data sets from multiple insurers.



For instance, the Society of Actuaries (SOA) typically produces an ultimate mortality table each year that is based on a fairly wide data set. It calculates mortalities for both men and women in the U.S., and also includes a blended table with the ultimate mortality of the entire U.S. population.﻿﻿
What Is Ultimate Net Loss?  

Ultimate net loss is a party's total financial obligation when an insured event occurs. The insured's ultimate net loss from costs such as property damage, medical expenses and legal fees will be offset by the portion of the loss that is paid by the insurance company (usually the amount of the claim that exceeds the insured's deductible, up to the policy maximum). Thus, the insured's loss will often be limited to the policy deductible unless the total loss exceeds the policy maximum.


   Understanding Ultimate Net Loss  

An insurance company's ultimate net loss from a claim may be offset by the salvage value of any recoverable items, awards from successful claims against third parties, money from reinsurance and the policyholder's deductible and policy maximum. Ultimate net loss can be a generic term that refers to the total amount of any loss, but in finance, it is most commonly used to refer to an insurance company's total loss from a policyholder's claim.



Insurance companies can protect themselves against large ultimate net losses by sharing policy risk with reinsurers. When an insurer shares a portion of the premiums it collects with a reinsurance company, it gains protection against a portion of its claims losses. For example, an insurance company might receive $30,000 in annual premiums for a $10 million policy. To protect itself against the threat of a $10 million loss, the insurance company might cede $15,000 of the annual premium to a reinsurer, who would agree to cover $5 million of the potential loss.


   Ultimate Net Loss and Liability Insurance  

In liability insurance, ultimate net loss is the amount actually paid or payable for the settlement of a claim for which the reinsured is liable (including or excluding defense costs), after deductions are made for recoveries and certain specified reinsurance.



In liability insurance contract language, ultimate net loss is often described as "the total sum which the insured, or his underlying insurers as scheduled, or both, become obligated to pay by reason of personal injuries … and shall also include … expenses for doctors, lawyers, nurses and investigators and other persons, and for litigation, settlement, adjustment and investigation of claims and suits which are paid as consequence of any occurrence cover hereunder." 


   Ultimate Net Loss and Reinsurance  

In reinsurance, ultimate net loss refers to the unit of loss to which the reinsurance applies, as determined by the reinsurance agreement. In other words, the gross loss less any recoveries from other reinsurance which reduce the loss to the treaty in question.
What is the Ultimate Oscillator?  

The Ultimate Oscillator is a technical indicator that was developed by Larry Williams in 1976 to measure the price momentum of an asset across multiple timeframes. By using the weighted average of three different timeframes the indicator has less volatility and fewer trade signals compared to other oscillators that rely on a single timeframe. Buy and sell signals are generated following divergences. The Ultimately Oscillator generates fewer divergence signals than other oscillators due to its multi-timeframe construction.















TradingView.





Key Takeaways


The indicator uses three timeframes in its calculation: seven, 14, and 28 periods. 
The shorter timeframe has the most weight in the calculation, while the longer timeframe has the least weight.
Buy signals occur when there is bullish divergence, the divergence low is below 30 on the indicator, and the oscillator then rises above the divergence high.
A sell signal occurs when there is bearish divergence, the divergence high is above 70, and the oscillator then falls below the divergence low.

   How to Calculate the Ultimate Oscillator  

Calculate the Buying Pressure (BP) which is the close price of the period less the low of that period or prior close, whichever is lower. Record these values for each period as they will be summed up over the last seven, 14, and 28 periods to create BP Sum.
Calculate the True Range (TR) which is the current period's high or the prior close, whichever is higher, minus the lowest value of the current period's low or the prior close. Record these values for each period as they will be summed up over the last seven, 14, and 28 periods to create TR Sum.
Calculate Average7, 14, and 28 using the BP and TR Sums calculations from steps one and two. For example, the Average7 BP Sum is the calculated BP values added together for the last seven periods.
Calculate the Ultimate Oscillator using the Average7, 14, and 28 values. Average7 has a weight of four, Average14 has a weight of two, and Average28 has a weight of one. Sum the weights in the denominator (in this case, the sum is seven, or 4+2+1). Multiply by 100 when other calculations are complete.


   What Does the Ultimate Oscillator Tell You?  

The Ultimate Oscillator is a range-bound indicator with a value that fluctuates between 0 and 100. Similar to the Relative Strength Index (RSI), levels below 30 are deemed to be oversold, and levels above 70 are deemed to be overbought. Trading signals are generated when the price moves in the opposite direction as the indicator, and are based on a three-step method.



Larry Williams developed the Ultimate Oscillator in 1976 and published it in Stocks & Commodities Magazine in 1985. With many momentum oscillators correlating too heavily to near-term price movements, Williams developed the Ultimate Oscillator to incorporate multiple timeframes to smooth out the indicator's movements and provide a more reliable indicator of momentum, with fewer false divergences.



False divergences are common in oscillators that only use one timeframe, because when the price surges the oscillator surges. Even if the price continues to rise the oscillator tends to fall forming a divergence even though the price may still be trending strongly.



In order for the indicator to generate a buy signal, Williams recommended a three-step approach.



First, a bullish divergence must form. This is when the price makes a lower low but the indicator is at a higher low.
Second, the first low in the divergence (the lower one) must have been below 30. This means the divergence started from oversold territory and is more likely to result in an upside price reversal.
Third, the Ultimate oscillator must rise above the divergence high. The divergence high is the high point between the two lows of the divergence.



Williams created the same three-step method for sell signals.



First, a bearish divergence must form. This is when the price makes a higher high but the indicator is at a lower high.Second, the first high in the divergence (the higher one) must be above 70. This means the divergence started from overbought territory and is more likely to result in a downside price reversal.Third, the Ultimate oscillator must drop below the divergence low. The divergence low is the low point between the two highs of the divergence.


   The Difference Between the Ultimate Oscillator and Stochastic Oscillator  

The Ultimate Oscillator has three lookback periods or timeframes. The Stochastic Oscillator has only one. The Ultimate Oscillator doesn't typically include a signal line (one could be added), while the Stochastic does. While both indicators generate trade signals based on divergence, the signals will be different due to the different calculations. Also, the Ultimate Oscillator uses a three-step method for trading divergence.


   Limitations of Using the Ultimate Oscillator  

While the three-step trading method for the indicator may help eliminate some poor trades, it also eliminates many good ones. Divergence is not present at all price reversal points. Also, a reversal won't always occur from overbought or oversold territory. Also, waiting for the oscillator to move above the divergence high (bullish divergence) or below the divergence low (bearish divergence) could mean poor entry point as the price may have already run significantly in the reversal direction.



As with all indicators, the Ultimate Oscillator shouldn't be used in isolation, but rather as part of a complete trading plan. Such a plan will typically include other forms of analysis such as price analysis, other technical indicators, and/or fundamental analysis.
What Is Ultimogeniture?  

Ultimogeniture, also known as postremogeniture or junior right, is a system of inheritance whereby the youngest son gains possession of his deceased father's estate. Many rural areas of medieval England used this system, as well as parts of France. It often applied to farmland, but sometimes included other types of land in addition to personal property.



This system is very rare today. On the contrary, primogeniture, which means inheritance by a firstborn son, is slightly more common today. Historically, primogeniture has been the most prevalent inheritance system.





Key Takeaways

Traditional inheritance rules granted the sons of a father (rather than the daughters) to be the primary beneficiary of his property upon death.Ultimogeniture, or junior right, was a system whereby the last son to be born became the primary beneficiary.Ultimogeniture was desirable for peasant or agricultural classes because it helped ensure that older children remained on the farm to work.Ultimogeniture can be contrasted with the system of primogeniture, a method of inheritance favored by the elite classes whereby the firstborn son was the sole heir.


   Understanding Ultimogeniture  

Ultimogeniture, primogeniture and other forms of traditional inheritance are very rare in modern society. Most developed countries rely on trusts and wills that explicitly state the desires of the decedent. However, in the past, the position of birth (and the male gender) tended to determine inheritance rights.



Practicality played an important part in this system. People didn’t live as long in the past, largely due to war and the spread of diseases. As a result, a family patriarch often died while he still had one or more minor sons. Bequeathing land to the youngest son encouraged the older minor children to remain on the farm, at least until they became old enough to marry. This kept a captive workforce and provided enough labor to support the patriarch’s widow.



While ultimogentiure kept sons on the farm, merchant families and nobility didn't have the same need for physical labor. Instead, they tended to use primogeniture, which grants the right of succession to the firstborn son. Primogeniture was also the primary method for establishing royal lineages and naming new kings.



As people eventually began to live longer, primogeniture and other social norms for inheritance slowly replaced ultimogeniture for all social classes.


   Ultimogeniture vs. Modern-Day Inheritance  

Today, inheritance depends far less on gender and birth order. Also, because women make up a substantial percentage of the workforce, children inherit both from mothers and fathers, and sometimes from two of each, considering split families and same-sex households.



No matter the family make-up, estate planning and a will is important. A will stipulates the bequest of assets to heirs, as well as the settlement of estate taxes. The presence of a will eliminates any chance of intestacy, where inheritance decisions end up in the hands of a probate court. In cases of intestacy, the property goes to a surviving spouse first, then to any children, then to extended family and descendants. However, if no family can be found, the property typically reverts to the state. Intestacy can be avoided by creating a will. With the help of an attorney experienced in estate law, a will can be set up very inexpensively.



In addition to wills, some wealthier families set up trusts, which grant certain legal protections to surviving spouses and children. However, trusts generally are more complicated and costly. Also, it’s important to know the trustee is in control of a trust, not the person who established the trust. For this reason, simply having a will and spelling out who gets which particular assets is preferable in some instances.
What Is an Ultra ETF?  

An ultra ETF is a class of exchange-traded fund (ETF) that employs leverage in an effort to amplify the return of a set benchmark. Since first arriving on the scene in 2006, ultra ETFs have grown to include different ETFs with underlying benchmarks ranging from broad market indexes, such as the S&P 500 and Russell 2000, to specific sectors, such as technology, healthcare, and basic materials.



Ultra ETFs are also known as leveraged ETFs or geared funds.





Key Takeaways

An ultra ETF is a class of exchange-traded fund (ETF) that employs leverage in an effort to amplify the return of a set benchmark.They use financial derivatives and debt to increase the impact of price movements, offering to double, triple, or more the long or short performance of a given underlying index.Due to the high-risk, high-cost structure of ultra ETFs, they are best suited to quick trading strategies.


   Understanding an Ultra ETF  

ETFs are funds that invest in a basket of securities from the index that they track. They generally aim to achieve the same returns as their benchmark by replicating its holdings, offering investors the opportunity to mimic the performance of the broader equity market or, in other cases, gain complete exposure to a specific sector or trend.



A traditional exchange-traded fund usually tracks the securities in its underlying index on a one-to-one basis, meaning that if, for example, the S&P moves 1 percent, an S&P ETF will also move by 1 percent. Alternative ones, often referred to as ultra ETFs, seek to be more aggressive. These marketable securities use financial derivatives and debt to amplify returns, offering to double, triple, or more the long or short performance of a given underlying index.





Important:

Leveraging is an investing strategy that involves using borrowed funds to buy options and futures to increase the impact of price movements.



Increased daily volatility is both the biggest benefit and greatest danger of ultra ETFs. They are best suited to short-term investing strategies or quick trading to maximize a given bet in the market—due to the high-risk, high-cost structure of ultra ETFs, they are rarely used as long-term investments.



According to the prospectuses for these funds, ultra ETFs may not achieve double or more the return of the benchmark during flat markets. Long-term returns may also diverge from the desired performance target. The ultra ETFs' only aim is to amplify the daily return—a goal they have succeeded in fairly accurately in the short time they can be analyzed.


   Benefits of an Ultra ETF  

If an investor is convinced, say, that the S&P 500 is about to rise, they will probably want to explore ways to make as much money as possible from this conviction. An ultra ETF can cater to those needs, without incurring the additional expenses and stress of trading on margin—a process whereby a broker lends money to a customer so that he or she can purchase stocks or other securities with the securities held as collateral for the loan.



Ultra ETFs can be beneficial to tactical investors who are short on capital or allocation space within a diversified portfolio. For instance, they can invest 5 percent of their portfolios into an ultra ETF and gain closer to 10 percent exposure due to the leveraged returns.


   Limitations of an Ultra ETF  

Leverage is a double-edged sword: It can lead to significant gains, as well as significant losses. The use of leverage magnifies not only the return potential of these ETFs, but also the standard deviation, making these investments riskier than non-leveraged ETFs targeting the same index or investment style. In other words, these vehicles are not for the average investor.






Ultra ETFs represent just a small portion of the total ETF universe, accounting for approximately $59.26 billion, or 3.9 percent of the $1.52 trillion total ETF market as of Q2 2022.



Anyone looking to make long-term, buy and hold investments should also steer clear of ultra ETFs. Daily rebalancing and compounding, combined with leverage, will cause investment results to diverge significantly over time from expectations. This is due to the wide variance of performance that make standard performance measures such as the geometric mean of limited use.



Potential payoffs can be significantly impaired by charges, too. Because of their complexity and use of borrowed funds, ultra ETFs carry much higher expense ratios than standard ETFs. The average fee for regular ETFs is roughly 0.5 percent, or $5.00 for every $1,000 invested in 2022. Ultra ETFs, on the other hand, usually come with expense ratios of 1 percent or more.


   Special Considerations  

Ultra ETFs also enable investors to amplify their returns when shorting, or betting against, an underlying index.



Inverse ultra ETFs, or ultra shorts, use leverage to make extra money when a market declines in value. When used properly, they allow sophisticated investors to hedge existing long positions with short exposure.
What Is an Ultra-High-Net-Worth Individual (UHNWI)?  

Ultra-high-net-worth individuals (UHNWI) are people with a net worth of at least $30 million. This category is composed of the wealthiest people in the world, who control a tremendous amount of global wealth. This group of people is small—in terms of total population—but it continues to grow.



In 2023, the group totaled 579,625 individuals globally, down 3.8% from 2022, according to Knight Frank's Wealth Report Series, published in 2023. The U.S. has the most UHNWIs globally by a large margin (41.6%).





Key Takeaways

According to Knight Frank's definition, ultra-high-net-worth individuals are those with at least $30 million in investable assets.The U.S. is home to the most UHNWIs in the world—241,253.Most UHNWIs allocate a significant portion of their portfolios to equities, commercial real estate, and bonds. The majority of their wealth stems from the value of their primary and secondary homes.


   Understanding Ultra-High-Net-Worth Individuals (UHNWIs)  

The U.S. is home to 41.6% of the world's UHNWIs—241,253. Europe is the next closest, with 155,996. It is followed by China, which has 150,362.



The United Arab Emirates grew the most from 2021 to 2022 (18.1%). Knight Frank forecasts that the ranks of the ultra-wealthy will grow by 85% from a total of 579,625 to 744,812 by 2027.



By 2027, Hungary is expected to experience the most growth (74.4%), followed by Turkey (69.1%). The U.S. will continue to have the most UHNWIs by 2027, adding 24.6% more super-rich individuals.



More than 86% of ultra-high-net-worth wealth is held by people 50 and older, and a majority are men, according to a report published by Wealth-X in 2022. Only 10.8% are women, but that number is on the rise—among those below 50, women account for 13.9% vs. 10.2% of men under 50.






Ultra-high net worth is generally quoted in terms of combined net assets over a certain figure. While $30 million is typically the number used, the exact amount can differ depending on who defines it, the region the person lives in, and when the term is used.


   Examples of UHNWIs  

Many of the world's super-rich citizens are self-made individuals. This is evident in Forbes' annually curated list of the world's richest people. On its World's Real-Time Billionaires List, the magazine ranks the daily worth on its wealth-tracking platform. According to the website, "[The list] reflects changes since 5 pm EST of [the] prior trading day."



On Forbes' ever-changing list, on June 23, 2023, Elon Musk led the billionaire pack with $243 billion. He was followed by:



Bernard Arnault and his family ($222.6 billion)Jeff Bezos ($152 billion)Larry Elison ($148.6 billion)



The total worth of billionaires in 2023 tops $12.2 trillion, a decrease from $12.7 trillion in 2022. Others near the top of the world's UHNWI population include Warren Buffet, Bill Gates, and Larry Page.





2,640

The number of billionaires in 2023, according to Forbes.


   How the UHNWIs Invest  

Most UHNWIs do not have their money sitting in certificates of deposit (CDs), money market accounts, mutual funds, or a 401(k). Many ultra-high-net-worth individuals store the majority of their wealth in:



Primary and secondary homesStocks and bondsVenture capital and private equity



Many UHNWIs invest in property—on average, UHNWIs allocate 21% of their wealth to investment properties like residential or office buildings.



When Forbes published its list of billionaires for 2023, it pointed out that billionaires suffered losses and slow growth in 2023.




What Defines Ultra-High Net Worth?
Net worth is the combined value of all of your assets. How much you need to be considered ultra-high net worth will change with time as more people become millionaires and billionaires. For now, the threshold is considered by most to be $30 million.




How Many People Have an Ultra-High Net Worth?
According to Knight Frank's definition, there are 529,625 people with a net worth of over $30 million. Because there are now more billionaires than ever, the Forbes billionaire list might be a better indicator of UHNW. In June 2023, there were 44 people with a net worth of more than $30 billion.




What Percentage of the U.S. Population Has $2 million?
Surveys find different figures, but the latest information from the U.S. Census Bureau 2021 survey shows that one in 10 households (10%) have a net worth of more than $1.41 million.


   The Bottom Line  

Ultra-high net worth individuals are loosely defined as people with more than $30 million in net worth. This is measured by combining the value of all assets, not just investable or physical assets.



In June 2023, hundreds of thousands of individuals worldwide met this definition. The number of millionaires in the world continues to grow, so it's safe to say that there will soon be many more UHNWIs. In fact, there are so many that the definition might soon need to be changed.
What Is an Ultra-Short Bond Fund?  

An ultra-short bond fund is a bond fund that invests only in fixed-income instruments with very short-term maturities. An ultra-short bond fund will invest in instruments with maturities of less than one year. Because of their focus on bonds with very short durations, these portfolios offer minimal interest-rate sensitivity and therefore lower risk and total return potential. This strategy, however, tends to offer higher yields than money market instruments with fewer price fluctuations than a typical short-term fund.



Note that a short-term bond fund like this should not be confused with a bear bond fund or ETF that goes short bonds on a leveraged basis.





Key Takeaways

Ultra-short funds hold short-term fixed-income securities, maturing in less than one year.These funds can have more freedom and typically pursue higher yields by investing in riskier securities than traditional bond funds.The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) does not cover or guarantee ultra-short bond funds.In high-interest rate environments, ultra-short bond funds of certain types may be extra susceptible to losses.


   Understanding Ultra-Short Bond Funds  

Ultra-short bond funds give investors more significant protection against interest rate risk than longer-term bond investments. Since these funds have very low durations, increases in the rate of interest will affect their value less than a medium- or long-term bond fund.



While this strategy offers more protection against rising interest rates, they usually carry more risk than most money market instruments. Further, certificates of deposits (CDs) follow regulated investment guidelines, but an ultra-short bond fund has no more regulation than a standard fixed-income fund.


   Ultra-Short Bond Funds vs. Other Low-Risk Investments  

The differences between ultra-short bond funds and other fixed-income investments with relatively low risks–such as money market funds and certificates of deposit (CDs) are important.



Money market funds, for instance, may only invest in high-quality, short-term investments issued by the U.S. government, U.S. corporations, and state and local governments. Conversely, ultra-short funds have more freedom and typically pursue higher yields by investing in riskier securities. Also, the net asset values (NAV) of ultra-short bond funds fluctuate. By contrast, money market funds try to keep NAV stable at $1.00 per share. Money market funds are also subject to strict diversification and maturity standards. However, these regulations do not apply to ultra-short bond funds.



Furthermore, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) does not cover or guarantee ultra-short bond funds. A certificate deposit, on the other hand, is insured up to $250,000. The FDIC covers CDs, which promises a return of principal and a specified rate of interest because a bank or thrift institution holds the deposit. Also, CDs typically offer a better interest rate on deposited funds than a regular savings account.






Ultra-short bond funds that hold securities with longer average maturity dates will tend to be riskier than a fund with shorter average maturity dates, all other factors being equal.


   Credit Quality of Ultra-Short Bond Funds  

Investors should research the types of securities in which an ultra-short fund invests because a credit downgrade or default of portfolio securities may occur that can result in losses. Because short-term bonds mature relatively quickly, however, credit risk is less of a factor for ultra-short funds compared to traditional bond funds. This risk is further reduced if a fund principally invests in government securities.



However, investors should be aware of ultra-short bond funds that invest in bonds of companies with lower credit ratings, derivative securities, or private-label mortgage-backed securities in an attempt to boost yield. Those types of funds tend to be subject to higher levels of investment risk. As always, be skeptical of any investment that promises you a greater potential for return at no additional risk. Investors can learn more about an ultra-short bond fund by reading all of the fund’s available information, including its prospectus.


   Ultra-Short Bond Funds and High-Interest Rates  

In high-interest rate environments, ultra-short bond funds of certain types may be extra susceptible to losses. It is important for prospective investors to research a fund’s “duration,” which gauges how sensitive the fund’s portfolio may be to fluctuations in interest rates.



Any investment which promises a more significant potential for return at no additional risk should raise skepticism. Investors can learn more about an ultra-short bond fund by reading all of the fund’s available information, including its full prospectus.

What Are Ultra Vires Acts?  

Ultra vires acts are any acts that lie beyond the authority of a corporation to perform. Ultra vires acts fall outside the powers that are specifically listed in a corporate charter or law. This can also refer to any action that is specifically prohibited by the corporate charter.



The roots of the term are from a Latin phrase that means beyond the power. It is the opposite of under proper authority—intra vires. You will also find the term in the legal profession.


   Excessive Use of Power  

Ultra vires acts can also be defined as any excessive use of corporate power that has been granted. These acts cannot be legally defended in court. They will, in fact, leave the corporation vulnerable to lawsuits by employees or other parties.



Companies have a variety of legal documents and directives that outline the parameters of what actions are permitted by each organization, its employees, and directors. These documents can include what is known as a "memorandum of association." The memorandum is largely used in Europe but not in the United States.



The memorandum combined with articles of association can serve as a constitution for companies that outlines the conditions by which the organization may operate and interact with shareholders. The memorandum offers guidance on the external matters the company can engage in. Articles of incorporation also define the nature of a company, its purpose, and the type of organization it will be.



If other types of entities such as government bodies also take actions beyond the scope of their legal powers, their deeds can also be described as ultra vires acts.


   Examples of Ultra Vires Actions  

Actions that breach the above directives can be classified as ultra vires. For example, a company’s constitution might outline the procedure for appointing directors to its board. If board members are added or removed without following those procedures, then those actions would be described as ultra vires.



If individuals within a company make use of resources that go beyond the scope of their legal purview, this can be called ultra vires. Such actions may include appropriating company revenue or shares of the company that the individuals do not have legal ownership of. If a manager were to access the bank accounts of the company and use those assets for personal needs this would be classified as ultra vires acts. If an accountant or another financial officer within a company transferred ownership of company shares they have rights to control, this also falls under ultra vires acts.



When government bodies or agencies take action, the scope of their powers is determined by laws that can include a constitution. If branches of government go beyond those outlined powers, their actions can be deemed ultra vires and may face legal repercussions.
What Is High-Frequency Trading (HFT)?  

High-frequency trading (HFT) is a trading method that uses powerful computer programs to transact a large number of orders in fractions of a second. HFT uses complex algorithms to analyze multiple markets and execute orders based on market conditions. Traders with the fastest execution speeds are generally more profitable than those with slower execution speeds. HFT is also characterized by high turnover rates and order-to-trade ratios.





Key Takeaways

HFT is complex algorithmic trading in which large numbers of orders are executed within seconds.It adds liquidity to the markets and eliminates small bid-ask spreads.HFT is criticized for allowing large companies to gain an upper hand in trading.Another complaint is that the liquidity produced by this type of trading is momentary—it disappears within seconds, making it impossible for traders to take advantage of it.






   Understanding High-Frequency Trading (HFT)  

High-frequency trading is a type of algorithmic trading. Traders are able to use HFT when they analyze important data to make decisions and complete trades in a matter of a few seconds. HFT facilitates large volumes of trades in a short amount of time while keeping track of market movements and identifying arbitrage opportunities.



Some of the key characteristics of high-frequency trading include:



Trading at high speedsA large number of transactions executedShort-term investment horizons



Because of the complexities and intricacies involved with HFT, it isn't surprising that it is commonly used by banks, other financial institutions, and institutional investors.



It became popular when exchanges started to offer incentives for companies to add liquidity to the market. For instance, the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) has a group of liquidity providers called supplemental liquidity providers (SLPs) that attempts to add competition and liquidity for existing quotes on the exchange.



The SLP was introduced following the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008 when liquidity was a major concern for investors. As an incentive to companies, the NYSE pays a fee or rebate for providing said liquidity. With millions of transactions per day, this results in a large amount of profits.






Some of the best-known HFT firms include Tower Research, Citadel LLC, and Virtu Financial.


   Advantages and Disadvantages of High-Frequency Trading (HFT)  
  Advantages  

The main benefit of high-frequency trading is the speed and ease with which transactions can be executed. Banks and other traders are able to execute a large volume of trades in a short period of time—usually within seconds.



HFT has improved market liquidity and removed bid-ask spreads that would have previously been too small. This was tested by adding fees on HFT, which led bid-ask spreads to increase. One study assessed how Canadian bid-ask spreads changed when the government introduced fees on HFT. It found that market-wide bid-ask spreads increased by 13% and the retail spreads increased by 9%.


  Disadvantages  

HFT is controversial and has been met with some harsh criticism. It has replaced a number of broker-dealers and uses mathematical models and algorithms to make decisions, taking human decisions and interaction out of the equation.



Decisions happen in milliseconds, and this could result in big market moves without reason. As an example, on May 6, 2010, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) suffered its largest intraday point drop until then, declining 1,000 points and dropping 10% in just 20 minutes before rising again. A government investigation blamed a massive order that triggered a sell-off for the crash.



An additional critique of HFT is it allows large companies to profit at the expense of the little guys. Its so-called ghost liquidity is also a source of criticism: The liquidity provided by HFT is available to the market one second and gone the next, preventing traders from actually being able to trade this liquidity.





Pros

Large volume of transactions at once
Easy and speedy process
Improves market liquidity
Removes small bid-ask spreads



Cons

Removes human decision-making and interaction
Speedy transactions could result in major market moves
Traders can't trade liquidity







How Does High-Frequency Trading Work?
High-frequency trading is an automated form of trading. It involves the use of algorithms to identify trading opportunities. HFT is commonly used by banks, financial institutions, and institutional investors. It allows these entities to execute large batches of trades within a short period of time. Because everything is automated, trading becomes easy. HFT provides the market with liquidity. But it can result in major market moves and removes the human touch from the equation.




Does the Cryptocurrency Market Use High-Frequency Trading?
Yes, high-frequency trading does occur in the cryptocurrency market. It works the same way HFT does in other markets. Using algorithms, it analyzes crypto data and facilitates a large volume of trades at once within a short period of time—usually within seconds.




How Fast Is a High-Frequency Trade?
High-frequency trading is fast. It can be as fast as 10 milliseconds. In some cases, it can be even less to execute a large batch of trades.


   The Bottom Line  

Advances in technology have helped many parts of the financial industry evolve, including the trading world. Computers and algorithms have made it easier to locate opportunities and make trading faster. High-frequency trading allows major trading entities to execute big orders very quickly. Although it makes things easier, HFT (and other types of algorithmic trading) does come with drawbacks—notably the danger of causing major market moves as it did in 2010 when the Dow suffered a large intraday drop.
What Is an Umbrella Insurance Policy?  

An umbrella insurance policy is extra liability insurance coverage that goes beyond the limits of the insured's homeowners, auto, or watercraft insurance. It provides an additional layer of security to those who are at risk of being sued for damages to other people's property or injuries caused to others in an accident. It also protects against libel, vandalism, slander, and invasion of privacy.





Key Takeaways

An umbrella insurance policy is a type of personal liability coverage that goes above and beyond the amount that regular home or vehicle insurance offers.To own umbrella insurance, you must own standard homeowners, auto, or watercraft policy first; the umbrella policy kicks in after the regular coverage has been exhausted.Candidates for umbrella insurance include people who possess considerable assets or potentially hazardous things, or who engage in activities that could increase their risk of being sued.


   How an Umbrella Insurance Policy Works  

The added coverage provided by an umbrella insurance policy is most useful to high net worth individuals who own a lot of assets—or very expensive assets—and are at a significant risk of being sued. Small businesses also use an umbrella insurance policy to guard against potential monetary damages arising due to claims.



The premium for an umbrella insurance policy may be less expensive if the policy is purchased from the same insurer that provided the original auto, home, or watercraft insurance. Depending on the provider, the policyholder who wants to add an umbrella insurance policy is required to have a base insurance coverage of $150,000 to $250,000 for auto insurance and $250,000 to $300,000 for homeowners insurance.



Umbrella insurance is often referred to as excess liability insurance. If a policyholder is sued for damages that exceed the liability limits of car insurance, homeowners insurance, or other coverage types, an umbrella policy helps pay what they owe. In other words, if the dollar limit of the original policy has been exhausted, the umbrella policy acts as a fail-safe, so the insured person doesn't have to dip into savings and other assets.






Umbrella insurance may also provide coverage not included in a basic insurance policy, such as libel, slander, and false imprisonment.


   Special Considerations  

People who regularly purchase umbrella insurance will usually own expensive property or have significant savings. Or they may own dangerous things that can cause injury (swimming pools, trampolines, dogs, etc.). They might also engage in activities that increase their chances of lawsuits, such as:



Being a landlordCoaching kids’ sportsServing on the board of a nonprofitVolunteeringRegularly posting reviews of products and businessesParticipating in sports where you could easily injure others (skiing, surfing, hunting, etc.)





$150 to $300

The annual cost of $1 million personal umbrella insurance policy, according to the Insurance Information Institute


   Example of an Umbrella Insurance Policy  

To understand how umbrella insurance can help, consider the following scenario. If a driver runs a red light and accidentally hits another car, there might be significant damage to the vehicle and several people might be injured.



With car repairs totaling $50,000 and the treatment of the injuries eclipsing $500,000, the driver at fault may be liable for expenses that go far beyond the coverage limits of their insurance. An umbrella insurance policy will pick up the additional liability costs beyond the limits of car insurance coverage.
What is an Umbrella Personal Liability Policy  

An umbrella personal liability policy is extra liability coverage which goes beyond the limits of the insured’s home, auto or other liability coverage. It provides an additional layer of security to those who are at risk of high loss if they injure someone else, or someone’s property. An umbrella policy provides broad coverage, meaning that some claims which would not be covered by a standard policy may have coverage under the umbrella policy.


   BREAKING DOWN Umbrella Personal Liability Policy  

Umbrella personal liability insurance is often referred to as excess liability insurance. It protects savings and other assets from a major lawsuit if a policyholder finds themselves on the wrong end of a damages lawsuit. These lawsuits may exceed the liability limits of an automobile, homeowners, or other insurance coverage. An umbrella policy kicks in to pay damages, up to the ceiling stated in the contract.



Before an individual can add umbrella personal liability to an existing policy, it must contain minimum levels of liability specified by the insurance company. Depending on the provider, the policyholder wanting to add umbrella coverage is required to have a base level of $150,000 to $250,000 for auto insurance and $250,000 to $300,000 for homeowners insurance.



Umbrella policies usually do not add significantly to the premium since the risk of a significant claim is minimal. Also, the premium may be less expensive if the policy comes from the same insurer that provides the original auto, home or watercraft insurance. Umbrella personal liability policies do not cover business losses, contract disputes or damages resulting from criminal actions.


   Umbrella Policies Protect People With a Lot to Lose  

The added coverage of an umbrella policy is most useful to wealthy individuals, at significant risk of loss from a lawsuit. For example, if a driver with $5 million in assets hits and severely injures a pedestrian, they could be liable for damages which far exceed the typical car insurance policy limit of $250,000. Beyond medical bills, the driver could be responsible for lost income of the injured pedestrian. If the pedestrian happens to be a high earner and can no longer work, the liability could quickly reach into millions of dollars, wiping out the driver’s fortune.



Starting umbrella coverage is $1 million, and increase in increments of $1 million.



In a lawsuit, it is technically possible for a an individual to receive a judgment higher than their net worth. However, federal law puts strict limits on the garnishment of wages for civil damages.﻿﻿ State laws will vary by jurisdiction on the protection they provide for assets. As an example, some states offer unlimited protection for the primary homestead, while others grant limited protection, and a few provide no protection at all. The same applies to annuities and life insurance benefits.

What is Umpire Clause  

n umpire clause refers to language in an insurance policy that provides for a means of resolution by an unbiased third party if an insurer and an insured cannot agree on the amount of a claim payment. An umpire clause is the same thing as an arbitration clause. The arbitration process requires both the insurance company and the policy holder to hire an appraiser of their choosing to assess the damages and the cost to repair them. The umpire will agree with one or perhaps both of the resulting appraisals and that amount will be used to satisfy the claim.﻿﻿


   Understanding Umpire Clause  

The umpire clause is closely related to the appraisal clause, which allows a policyholder to hire an independent appraiser to determine the value of their damages. In turn, the insurance company will also hire their own appraiser. The two appraisers will then get together and select an umpire. The umpire is basically the arbitrator.﻿﻿



These three individuals are known as the appraisal panel. The purpose of the appraisal panel is to set or determine the amount of loss, or the total dollar amount needed to return the damaged property back to it's original condition by repair or replacement.





Key Takeaways

The umpire clause is similar to an arbitration clause and is used to settle disputes between insurance companies and the insured.Each party hires an independent appraiser who works with the umpire to resolve differences relating to the claim.Only two of the three members of this panel need to agree to resolve the case.



With an appraiser panel in place, the policyholder's chosen appraiser and the insurance company's chosen appraiser will review the documents, estimates, and differences between them. They'll then try to resolve their differences. In such a scenario, the three will discuss the issues and try to reach an agreed settlement of the differences. If disagreements between the two appraisers can't be resolved, the umpire makes the ultimate decision.



Interestingly, not everyone one on the appraiser panel has to agree. Only two of the three individuals need to agree, the umpire and either appraiser or the two appraisers themselves. Once two of the three individuals on the appraisal panel sign the award, the dispute is over. The amount on the award is paid to the policyholder.


   Example of How an Umpire Clause Works  

For example, let's say Max has a car accident and his car is totaled. He is at fault, so he files a first-party claim with his own insurance company. The insurer determines that the value of his totaled vehicle is $10,000 and offers to pay him the $10,000 minus his $1,000 collision deductible. According to his research, Max believes the value of his car to be closer to $15,000. Since they are so far apart, Max and his insurer agree to invoke the policy's umpire clause and have an umpire and appraisers determine the value of the car.
What Are the UN Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI)?  

The UN Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI) is an international organization that works to promote the incorporation of environmental, social, and corporate governance factors (ESG) into investment decision-making.



Launched in April 2006 with support from the United Nations (UN), the PRI has over 4,900 participating financial institutions, as of March 31, 2021. These institutions participate by becoming signatories to the PRI’s six key principles and then filing regular reports on their progress.





Key Takeaways

The UN Principles for Responsible Investment is an organization dedicated to promoting environmental and social responsibility among the world’s investors.The UN Principles for Responsible Investment relies on voluntary disclosures by participating members, called signatories.Today, UN Principles for Responsible Investment signatories are responsible for over $121 trillion in assets worldwide, and include some of the world’s largest and most influential investors.


   Understanding the UN Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI)  

They core philosophy behind the organization is that environmental and social considerations are relevant factors in investment decision-making and should therefore be considered by responsible investors. For example, supporters of the PRI argue that it is both financially and ethically irresponsible to not consider the environmental impact of a company when assessing its merits as an investment. By contrast, many investors have historically viewed environmental and social impacts as negative externalities which can be ignored for purposes of investment decisions.



To combat this long-prevailing attitude, the PRI put forward six core principles, to which signatory companies must agree to commit themselves. As expressed on the organization’s website, these six principles are as follows:



Principle 1: We will incorporate ESG issues into investment analysis and decision-making processes.Principle 2: We will be active owners and incorporate ESG issues into our ownership policies and practices.Principle 3: We will seek appropriate disclosure on ESG issues by the entities in which we invest.Principle 4: We will promote acceptance and implementation of the Principles within the investment industry.Principle 5: We will work together to enhance our effectiveness in implementing the Principles.Principle 6: We will each report on our activities and progress towards implementing the Principles.



Collectively, the organizations that have become signatories to these six principles are responsible for a total assets under management (AUM) of over $121 trillion. This includes many prominent founding signatories who helped launch the program, such as the Norwegian Government Pension Fund; the Government Pension Fund of Thailand; the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board; and the California Public Employees’ Retirement System (CalPERS).


   Example of the UN Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI)  

Standard Life is a financial services company that was acquired by Manulife in 2015. Standard Life—a PRI signatory—uses ESG factors to assess emerging risks and opportunities in the automobile supply chain, particularly as it relates to new anti-pollution legislation being considered by the European Union (EU).



After analyzing the potential impact of this new legislation on various automakers and parts suppliers, the company decided to make adjustments to their investments in that sector and also updated their valuation estimate of the lithium-ion battery manufacturer, LG Chem. This upward adjustment was due in part to their belief that the increased emission standards would accelerate the transition toward electric vehicles and create an increased demand for batteries worldwide.
What Is Unadjusted Basis?  

Unadjusted basis refers to the original cost to purchase an asset. This amount includes not only the initial price the purchaser paid to acquire the asset but also includes other costs such as expenses and liabilities assumed to purchase it. Adjusted basis is a related term, and refers to any adjustments made to the original purchase price of an asset over time. Unadjusted basis is used mostly in accounting nomenclature and is akin to the concept of cost basis.


   Understanding Unadjusted Basis  

Unadjusted basis is the initial value assigned to an asset. It includes the cash cost or price of an asset, any liability assumed to acquire the asset, any asset the purchaser gave to the seller as part of the transaction, and any purchase expenses incurred to acquire the asset. Purchase expenses may include commissions, fees, survey costs, transfer taxes, or title insurance, for example.


   Example of Unadjusted Basis  

Sam purchased a building from Emily using $100,000 in cash and a $50,000 mortgage. As part of the purchase agreement, Sam also paid $1,000 in property taxes attributed to a period of time in which Emily was still the owner of the property. Total closing costs and fees for Sam to purchase this property were $4,000. Sam's unadjusted basis for this property is $100,000 + $50,000 + $1,000 + $4,000 = $155,000.


   Unadjusted Basis in Practice  

The unadjusted basis is used to calculate the gain on the sale of an asset. Extending Sam's purchase example above, assume Sam later sold this piece of property for $175,000, after costs and fees associated with the sale. He could determine his return on investment by calculating the profit on the investment. He earned $20,000 ($175,000 - $155,000) net of expenses on this investment, which equates to a 12.9% return on investment (($175,000 - $155,000)/$155,000).



Unadjusted basis is also the starting point for determining depreciation on an asset, such as a plant or piece of manufacturing equipment, in accelerated depreciation methods. Depreciation is an accounting method of allocating the cost of a tangible asset over its useful life and is used to account for declines in the value of the asset over time. Accelerated depreciation methods allow the deduction of higher expenses from the unadjusted basis in the first years after purchase and lower expenses as the depreciated item ages.
What Are Unaffiliated Investments?  

Unaffiliated investments are investment holdings of an insurance company that it neither controls nor shares joint ownership with. Unaffiliated investments can include stocks, bonds, property, and other assets and are often disclosed in the financial statements of insurers.





Key Takeaways

Unaffiliated investments are investment holdings of an insurance company that it neither controls nor shares joint ownership with.Insurers invest in securities of various liquidities in a bid to increase the return on the premiums they receive.They need to have funds available quickly in order to cover liabilities, so they often make short-duration investments in highly liquid assets.Regulators periodically examine these investments to determine if they are suitable and likely to pose a threat to solvency. 


   Understanding Unaffiliated Investments  

Insurance companies use the proceeds from their underwriting activities in a number of different ways.



They set aside funds as loss reserves to cover liabilities that they may incur from policyholders making a claim.﻿ They pay commissions to brokers who bring in new business, and operational expenses such as salaries, benefits, and overhead. They also allocate capital to invest in securities of various liquidities in a bid to increase the return on the premiums they receive.



Insurers need to have funds available quickly in order to cover liabilities. As a result, they often make short-duration investments in highly liquid assets that can easily and promptly be converted into cash, alongside longer-term assets that may offer a higher return. 



Depending on the type of insurance policies underwritten, an insurer’s liability may last a few months to a few years. Short-term assets are considered part of the insurer’s current liquidity, which is used to cover policies that have a duration of less than a year.﻿





Important

Asset mixes vary over time, depending on the economy and industry-specific factors, and also hinge on what the insurer specializes in: Life companies, for example, generally have longer-term liabilities, enabling them to invest more in longer-term assets.


   History of Unaffiliated Investments   

Historically, insurers would generally invest in traditional asset classes that offer steady yields such as government bonds. This approach has been complicated since the financial crisis. Now that ultra-low interest rates are a regular fixture, insurers have been forced to widen their nets to secure decent returns.



In most cases, this has resulted in a shift to alternative investments, including private equity and structured finance, such as residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS).﻿



Because these types of non-traditional investments tend to be more complex, an increasing number of insurers have begun outsourcing investment decisions to specialist investment management firms. This has been particularly the case among smaller insurers, who generally have fewer resources available to effectively manage portfolios on their own.





51%

The hunt for yield and shift to more complex, non-traditional investments led about half of all U.S. insurers to outsource to an unaffiliated investment manager in 2019, according to the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC).﻿﻿﻿


   Special Considerations  

Insurers are required to report their financials to state insurance regulators periodically. These regulators look at liquidity ratios in order to determine how quickly an insurer will be able to pay for its policyholder liabilities, as well as to establish if the investment strategies and holdings of the insurer are likely to pose a threat to its solvency.﻿



Unaffiliated investments are included in the overall liquidity ratio, though this ratio does not take into account affiliated investments. They do not, however, appear in the calculation of an insurer’s combined ratio. This is because the combined ratio looks at cash outflows—expense ratio, loss and loss-adjustment ratio, and dividend ratio—to see how much money it costs to maintain the book of business.
What Are Unallocated Loss Adjustment Expenses (ULAE)?  

Unallocated loss adjustment expenses (ULAE) are costs incurred by an insurance company that cannot be attributed to the processing of a specific claim. They are among the expenses for which an insurer has to set aside reserve funds, in addition to allocated loss adjustment expenses and contingent commissions.





Key Takeaways

Unallocated loss adjustment expenses are business costs that the insurer cannot attribute to a specific claim.Allocated loss adjustment expenses are directly attributable to a specific claim.Insurers maintain reserve funds to manage both types of expenses.



Unallocated loss adjustment expenses combined with allocated loss adjustment expenses represent an insurer's estimate of the money it will pay out in claims in addition to the expenses associated with processing the claims.


   Understanding ULAE  

Allocated loss adjustment expenses (ALAE) are expenses linked directly to the processing of a specific claim. Insurers that use third parties to investigate the veracity of claims or to act as loss adjusters may include this expense in its allocated loss adjustment expenses.



ULAE expenses are more general and may include overhead and salaries. The most common expenses fall into the categories of operations and field adjusters.


  Calculating ULAE  

Because unallocated loss adjustment expenses do not apply to a specific claim, there's no loss date or report date for them. This makes calculations tricky. Any of several methods are available for calculating ULAE:



The transaction-based method allocates costs to each claim transaction, using an average cost for each type of transaction. This is the most accurate method, but it is also the most difficult to calculate.Another method is to use a percentage of an average year’s ULAE paid out. This method does not account for growth or changes to how often claims are made.Some insurers add a ratio of the amount of paid ULAE to paid losses, calculated from a certain number of years of data. This method does not include inflation adjustments.






Liability policies may contain a clause that allows the insurer to charge the client for some unallocated loss adjustment expenses.



The process of loss reserve development requires the insurer to adjust estimates to its loss and loss-adjustment expense reserves over a period of time. Analysts can determine how accurate an insurance company has been at estimating its reserves by examining its loss reserve development.


   Reimbursement for ULAE  

Some liability policies contain a clause, called an endorsement, that requires the policyholder to reimburse the insurance company for unallocated or allocated loss adjustment expenses. These expenses may include fees charged by attorneys, investigators, experts, arbitrators, mediators, and other costs incidental to adjusting a claim.



It is important to carefully read the endorsement language, which may say that a loss adjustment expense is not intended to include the policyholder’s attorney fees and costs if an insurer denies coverage and a policyholder successfully sues the insurer. 



In this situation, the insurance company has done no actual adjusting of the claim, and should not be entitled to apply its deductible to the expenses incurred by the policyholder in defending the claim denied by the insurance company.
What Is an Unamortized Bond Discount?  

An unamortized bond discount is an accounting methodology for certain bonds. The unamortized bond discount is the difference between the par value of a bond—its value at maturity—and the proceeds from the sale of the bond by the issuing company, less the portion that has already been amortized (written off in gradual increments) on the profit and loss statement.





key takeaways

An unamortized bond discount represents a difference between the face value of a bond and the amount actually paid for it by investors—the proceeds reaped by the bond's issuer.The bond issuer amortizes—that is, writes off gradually—a bond discount over the remaining term of the associated bond as an interest expense. The amount of the bond discount that has not yet been written off is the unamortized bond discount.The flip side or an unamortized bond discount is an unamortized bond premium, which comes into play when the bond is selling for more than its face value.


   How Unamortized Bond Discount Works  

The discount refers to the difference in the cost to purchase a bond (its market price) and its par, or face, value. The issuing company can choose to expense the entire amount of the discount or can handle the discount as an asset to be amortized. Any amount that has yet to be expensed is referred to as the unamortized bond discount.



A bond discount to par value occurs when the current interest rate associated with a bond is lower than the market interest rate of issues of similar credit risk. If on the date a bond is sold, the listed bond's coupon or interest rate is below current market rates; investors will only agree to purchase the bond at a "discount" from its face value.



Because bond prices and interest rates are inversely related, as interest rates move after bond issuance, bond's will be said to be trading at a premium or a discount to their par or maturity values. In the case of bond discounts, they usually reflect an environment in which interest rates have risen since a bond's issuance. Because the bond's coupon or interest rate is now below market rates, and investors can get better deals (and better yields) with new issues, those selling the bond have to, in effect, mark it down to make it more appealing to buyers. So the bond will be priced at a discount to its par value.


   Accounting for the Unamortized Bon Discount  

The bond's issuer can always elect to write off the entire amount of a bond discount at once, if the amount is immaterial (e.g., has no material impact on the financial statements of the issuer). If so, there is no unamortized bond discount, because the entire amount was amortized, orwritten off, in one gulp. Usually, though, the amount is material, and so is amortized over the life of the bond, which may span a number of years. In this latter case, there is nearly always an unamortized bond discount if bonds were sold below their face amounts, and the bonds have not yet been retired.



A bond's unamortized discount to par will:



turn into a recognized capital loss if the bond is sold before its stated maturity; or,shrink as the bond's market price rises with the passage of time as the bond nears its maturity date, which the bond will then be priced at its par value.


   Unamoritzed Bond Premium  

The flip side or an unamortized bond discount is an unamortized bond premium. A bond premium is a bond that is priced higher than its face value. Unamortized bond premium refers to the amount between the face value and the higher amount the bond was sold at, minus the interest.The unamortized bond premium is the part of the overall bond premium that the issuer will amortize—that is, write off incrementally against expenses in the future. The amortized amount of this bond is credited as an interest expense.
What Is Unamortized Bond Premium?  

An unamortized bond premium refers to the difference between a bond's face value and its sale price. If a bond is sold at a discount, for instance, at 90 cents on the dollar, the issuer must still repay the full 100 cents of face value at par. Since this interest amount has not yet been paid to bondholders, it is a liability for the issuer.





Key Takeaways

An unamortized bond premium is the net difference in the price that a bond issuer sells securities less the bonds' actual face value at maturity.An unamortized bond premium is a liability for issuers as they have not yet written off this interest expense, but will eventually come due.On financial statements, unamortized bond premium is recorded in a liability account called the Unamortized Bond Premium Account.


   Understanding Unamortized Bond Premium  

The bond premium is the excess amount that the bond is priced at over its face value. When prevailing interest rates in the economy decrease, the price of bonds increase. This is because the market interest rate becomes lower than the fixed coupon rate on outstanding bonds.



Since bondholders are holding higher-interest paying bonds, they require a premium as compensation in the market. The unamortized bond premium is what remains of the bond premium that the issuer has not yet written off as an interest expense.



For example, let’s assume that when interest rates were 5% a bond issuer sold bonds with a 5% fixed coupon to be paid annually. After a period of time, interest rates declined to 4%. New bond issuers will issue bonds with the lower interest rate. Investors who would rather buy a bond with a higher coupon will have to pay a premium to the higher-coupon bondholders to incentivize them to sell their bonds. In this case, if the bond’s face value is $1,000 and the bond sells for $1,090 after interest rates decline, the difference between the selling price and par value is the unamortized bond premium ($90).



The unamortized bond premium is the part of the bond premium that will be amortized (written off) against expenses in the future. The amortized amount of this bond is credited as an interest expense. If the bond pays taxable interest, the bondholder can choose to amortize the premium, that is, use a part of the premium to reduce the amount of interest income included for taxes.


   Special Considerations  

Those who invest in taxable premium bonds typically benefit from amortizing the premium, because the amount amortized can be used to offset the interest income from the bond, which will reduce the amount of taxable income the investor will have to pay with respect to the bond. The cost basis of the taxable bond is reduced by the amount of premium amortized each year.



In a case wherein the bond pays tax-exempt interest, the bond investor must amortize the bond premium. Although this amortized amount is not deductible in determining taxable income, the taxpayer must reduce his or her basis in the bond by the amortization for the year.



An unamortized bond premium is booked as a liability to the bond issuer. On an issuers balance sheet, this item is recorded in a special account called the Unamortized Bond Premium Account. This account recognizes the remaining amount of bond premium that the bond issuer has not yet amortized or charged off to interest expense over the life of the bond.


   Example: Unamortized Bond Premium Calculation  

To calculate the amount to be amortized for the tax year, the bond price is multiplied by the yield to maturity (YTM), the result of which is subtracted from the coupon rate of the bond. Using the example above, the yield to maturity is 4%.



Multiplying the selling price of the bond by the YTM yields $1,090 x 4% = $43.60.
This value when subtracted from the coupon amount (5% coupon rate x $1,000 par value = $50) results in $50 - $43.60 = $6.40, which is the amortizable amount.
For tax purposes, a bondholder can reduce his or her $50 interest income to $50 - $6.40 = $43.60.
The unamortized premium after a year is $90 bond premium - $6.40 amortized amount = $83.60.
For the second tax year, $6.40 of the bond premium has already been amortized, so the bond's cost basis is $1,090 - $6.40 = $1,083.60.
Premium amortization for Year 2 = $50 - ($1,083.60 x 4%) = $50 - $43.34 = $6.64.
Premium remaining after the second year or the unamortized premium is $83.60 - $6.64 = $76.96.



Assuming the bond matures in five years, you can run the same calculation for the remaining three years. For instance, the bond's cost basis in the third year will be $1,083.60 - $6.64 = $1,076.96.
What Are Unappropriated Retained Earnings?  

Unappropriated retained earnings consist of any portion of a company's retained earnings that are not classified as appropriated retained earnings. Appropriated retained earnings are set aside by the board and are assigned to a specific purpose, such as factory construction, hiring new labor, buying new equipment, or marketing. They will not be distributed to shareholders as dividend payments. Unappropriated retained earnings can be passed on to shareholders in the form of dividend payments.





Key Takeaways

Unappropriated retained earnings are the portion of retained earnings not assigned to a specific business purpose.Dividends are usually paid out through unappropriated earnings based on the dividend payment schedule.Increased unappropriated retained earnings can indicate that a business is doing well or that it is not investing enough in itself.


   Understanding Unappropriated Retained Earnings  

Unappropriated retained earnings help to determine the amount of dividends that will be paid to shareholders. They are not directed towards a specific purpose by the board and therefore are available to be paid out as dividends. The greater the unappropriated retained earnings, the higher the dividend that can possibly be paid. Unappropriated retained earnings are divided among all of the outstanding shares of the company and paid as dividends according to a predetermined dividend payment schedule.



The level of unappropriated retained earnings can provide a certain amount of insight into a company. For example, if unappropriated retained earnings are increasing over time and are being paid out as dividends, this can indicate that a company is performing better, in that sales are up, costs are static, and earnings are not needed for business purposes.



On the other hand, it could possibly indicate that management is not reinvesting in the company when it should be, letting equipment age or not spending enough on marketing, both of which could have adverse impacts down the road. It's important to pay attention to where and how a company spends its earnings.












Investopedia / Candra Huff


   Example of Unappropriated Retained Earnings  

For the fiscal year-end 2019, Company XYZ has retained earnings of $5 million. Currently, the company's machinery is aged and out of date. If the company invested in new, state of the art equipment, it could possibly lead to greater production and more efficiency in the future. This would allow the company to remain competitive amongst its peers. The company decides that it will need to spend $3 million on updating all of its equipment, and the board approves that it should do so.



This $3 million would be classified as appropriated retained earnings, as it will be allocated for a specific use (buying equipment). It is a decision made by management to reinvest in the company. The remainder of the retained earnings after accounting for the capital expenditure on equipment is $2 million ($5 million - $3 million = $2 million). This is the unappropriated retained earnings, and this is the amount through which dividends will be paid out to shareholders, based on the currently established dividend payment schedule.
What Is an Unauthorized Insurer?  

The term “unauthorized insurer” refers to a fraudulent business that is posing as a legitimate insurance company. As the name suggests, unauthorized issuers are not registered with their state’s insurance regulator, and as such are not permitted to legally sell insurance products.



Purchasing insurance from an unauthorized insurer is very dangerous, because the entity may not have the intention or capacity to fulfill its obligations.





Key Takeaways

An unauthorized insurer is an insurance company that is operating without the permission or oversight of its state insurance regulator.Operating an unauthorized insurer is illegal, and can result in legal or financial penalties.Customers who are sold insurance by unauthorized insurers may be entitled to compensation by the professionals who carried out the sale.


   How Unauthorized Insurers Work  

Those who operate unauthorized insurance companies are in effect perpetrating fraud on the public. After all, customers who rely on insurance companies themselves against personal or commercial risks may find themselves wholly unprotected if their insurer fails to honor their end of the transaction. In the case of unauthorized insurers, the customer may have little or no recourse, since the unauthorized insurer may never have had the requisite assets to make good on their claims.



In some cases, unauthorized insurers can fool professional intermediaries as well as policyholders. For example, unwitting insurance agents might be fooled into reselling or recommending the products offered by an unauthorized insurer. In those instances, the insurance broker might be held partially responsible for any losses or unpaid claims experienced by the policyholder. Moreover, the insurance agent may also be charged with committing a crime, be forced to pay a penalty, and even have their insurance license revoked.



To protect against these risks, it is wise for both individual customers and insurance professionals to check with their state insurance regulator before deciding whether to do business with a new insurance issuer that they are not already familiar with. Other best practices include paying attention to potential warnings signs that might indicate that a particular insurer is not legitimate. Examples include very aggressive agents or brokers who express an urgency to sign up for a product immediately, premiums that seem unrealistically low compared to comparable companies’ coverage, and the lack of any listed phone number or other customer service mechanisms.


   Example of an Unauthorized Insurer  

Emma is the owner of a small retail store, and is looking for commercial insurance to protect her business against theft, property damage, and general liability. To assist in her search, she reaches out to a local insurance broker who claims to be an expert in the various options available in her region. After briefly discussing her needs, the broker recommends to her a product sold by a new insurer whose rates are nearly half those of the nearest-priced competitor. Emma decides to sign on to this insurance package, partly because the offer was only available for the next 24 hours.



A year later, Emma experiences a burglary at her store, resulting in several months’ worth of lost inventory. Thankfully, she remembers that she had purchased insurance against theft and other risks and had been diligently paying her monthly premiums. Therefore, she fully expects to be reimbursed for her losses, and fills out the necessary paperwork to file her claim.



After waiting several weeks without any reply, Emma is advised to inform her state insurance regulator about the unresponsive insurer. To her surprise, Emma is told by the regulator that there is no record of her insurance company, and that she was therefore unwittingly sold insurance by an unauthorized insurer.



Depending on the details of her case, Emma may be entitled to some form of compensation from the state insurance regulator or another governing body, although it is also possible that she will be forced to cover her business’s losses personally. It is also likely that the insurance broker who sold her the fraudulent policy will be investigated by the insurance regulator, and may in fact be ordered to compensate Emma for her loss.
What Is Unbanked?  

Unbanked is an informal term for adults who do not use banks or banking institutions in any capacity. While often an issue in the developing world, there are also pockets of unbanked adults in developed countries, including the United States.





Key Takeaways


Unbanked refers to adults who do not use or do not have access to any traditional financial services, including savings accounts, credit cards, or personal checks.
The unbanked are often concentrated in less developed countries or in poorer regions of developed countries.
A lack of money, trust, and privacy concerns are three main reasons people in the U.S. are unbanked.
Governments and other organizations have initiated several programs to "bank" the unbanked, such as the FDIC's Money Smart program.



   Understanding the Unbanked  

Unbanked people generally pay for things in cash or else purchase money orders or prepaid debit cards. Unbanked people also typically do not have insurance, pensions, or any other type of professional money-related services. They may take advantage of alternative financial services, such as check-cashing and payday lending, if such services are available to them.


  Unbanked vs. underbanked  

Underbanked is a related term. It refers to families who have checking or savings accounts but often rely on alternative financial services such as money orders, check-cashing services, and payday loans, as opposed to traditional loans and credit cards, to manage their finances.


  Unbanked households in the United States  

A Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) study revealed that more than 7 million or 5.4% of American households were unbanked in 2019 in the United States, which is the fewest recorded since its survey was first conducted in 2009. In its 2017 study, the FDIC estimated that 8.4 million or 6.5% of households were unbanked.



The FDIC stated that unbanked rates tend to be higher among certain segments of the population, namely households with low, volatile, or no income. Education can also be influential as people without a high school diploma were deemed more likely to be without a bank account.



Black and Latinx households are overrepresented among the unbanked, according to a Boston Consulting Group analysis of FDIC data. While they make up 32% of the U.S. population, they represent 64% of unbanked households.



The rate of unbanked households varies greatly from one state to the next. The highest rate of unbanked households remains in the South at 6.2%. Unbanked households in the remainder of the country were as follows:



5% of households in the Midwest4.9% in the West4.7% in Northeast



Mississippi and Louisiana were the states with the highest rate of unbanked households, sitting at 12.8% and 11.4%, respectively. New Hampshire and Vermont had the lowest instances of unbanked households with 0.5% and 0.7%, respectively.






The Federal Reserve (Fed) also runs a survey on how households use banking services. According to its findings, 5% of U.S. households were unbanked in 2020.






   Why People Become Unbanked  

The main reason for being unbanked, according to the FDIC study, is cost—those who are unbanked can’t meet banks’ minimum requirement balances. Another way of looking at it: Traditional banks don’t provide access to the financial services and products unbanked populations need. For instance, someone living paycheck-to-paycheck with very low or volatile income, may not be able to wait for a paycheck to clear at a bank. So they turn to a check-cashing service, which will provide cash immediately, albeit for a fee.



In neighborhoods that are "bank deserts," such alternative financial services are also likely more common and open longer hours—in other words, more accessible and convenient than arranging for transportation to and from bank branches during limited banking hours. These high transaction costs (e.g. time/cost to visit bank branches, inconvenient hours), lack of clarity about fees, and alternative products that provided a more compelling value proposition have all been identified as reasons people are unbanked.



Lack of trust in banking institutions can also come into play. Distrust was the second main reason cited in the FDIC study for being unbanked—not surprising given the history of lending discrimination experienced by Blacks and Latinx in the U.S. and the lingering inequities. For instance, predominantly Black and Latinx neighborhoods have been targeted for predatory lending, including subprime mortgages. Recent immigrants who experienced banking crises in their countries of origin may also lack trust in banks.



Being unbanked is sometimes attributed to people’s lack of financial literacy or knowledge of banking products. But about half of unbanked people have previously held a bank account, so they are familiar with banking services.






The three main reasons people are unbanked are: not having enough money to meet minimum balance requirements; not trusting banks; and privacy concerns, according to the FDIC.


   Initiatives to Help the Unbanked  

Various state and federal programs have been aimed at helping the unbanked gain access to banking services and financial literacy. Some such initiatives include former California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger's Bank on California Initiative and the FDIC's Money Smart program.



The U.S. Treasury Department's Section 326 regulations, which allow banks and credit unions to accept identification issued by foreign governments, seek to help undocumented aliens become banked. The U.S. Treasury Department also makes federal payments to unbanked federal benefits recipients using a Mastercard prepaid debit card.




Why Is Being Unbanked a Problem?
Being unbanked can be undesirable for several reasons. Alternative financial services, such as cash-checking services and payday loans, are much more costly. What’s more, without a bank account, people don’t generate the data they need to establish creditworthiness. As a result, when it comes time to cover an emergency car repair or medical bill, a payday loan may be their only option. These extra costs significantly hurt families who are already struggling to make ends meet.




How Many People Are Unbanked?
The Fed found that 5% of adults in the U.S. did not have a bank account in 2020. The FDIC, which uses different criteria, said that an estimated 7 million or 5.4% of American households were unbanked in 2019.




Who Are the Unbanked?
The FDIC says that unbanked rates are usually higher among lower-income households, less-educated households, Black households, Hispanic households, American Indian or Alaska Native households, working-age disabled households, and households with volatile income.
What Is Expectations Theory?  

Expectations theory attempts to predict what short-term interest rates will be in the future based on current long-term interest rates. The theory suggests that an investor earns the same interest by investing in two consecutive one-year bond investments versus investing in one two-year bond today. The theory is also known as the "unbiased expectations theory."

   Understanding Expectations Theory  

The expectations theory aims to help investors make decisions based upon a forecast of future interest rates. The theory uses long-term rates, typically from government bonds, to forecast the rate for short-term bonds. In theory, long-term rates can be used to indicate where rates of short-term bonds will trade in the future.


  Calculating Expectations Theory  

Let's say that the present bond market provides investors with a two-year bond that pays an interest rate of 20% while a one-year bond pays an interest rate of 18%. The expectations theory can be used to forecast the interest rate of a future one-year bond.



The first step of the calculation is to add one to the two-year bond’s interest rate. The result is 1.2.The next step is to square the result or (1.2 * 1.2 = 1.44).Divide the result by the current one-year interest rate and add one or ((1.44 / 1.18) +1 = 1.22).To calculate the forecast one-year bond interest rate for the following year, subtract one from the result or (1.22 -1 = 0.22 or 22%).



In this example, the investor is earning an equivalent return to the present interest rate of a two-year bond. If the investor chooses to invest in a one-year bond at 18%, the bond yield for the following year’s bond would need to increase to 22% for this investment to be advantageous.






Expectations theory aims to help investors make decisions by using long-term rates, typically from government bonds, to forecast the rate for short-term bonds.


   Disadvantages of Expectations Theory  

Investors should be aware that the expectations theory is not always a reliable tool. A common problem with using the expectations theory is that it sometimes overestimates future short-term rates, making it easy for investors to end up with an inaccurate prediction of a bond’s yield curve.



Another limitation of the theory is that many factors impact short-term and long-term bond yields. The Federal Reserve adjusts interest rates up or down, which impacts bond yields, including short-term bonds. However, long-term yields might be less affected because many other factors impact long-term yields, including inflation and economic growth expectations.



As a result, the expectations theory does not consider the outside forces and fundamental macroeconomic factors that drive interest rates and, ultimately, bond yields.


   Expectations Theory Versus Preferred Habitat Theory  

The preferred habitat theory takes the expectations theory one step further. The theory states that investors have a preference for short-term bonds over long-term bonds unless the latter pay a risk premium. In other words, if investors are going to hold onto a long-term bond, they want to be compensated with a higher yield to justify the risk of holding the investment until maturity.



The preferred habitat theory can help explain, in part, why longer-term bonds typically pay out a higher interest rate than two shorter-term bonds that, when added together, result in the same maturity.



When comparing the preferred habitat theory to the expectations theory, the difference is that the former assumes investors are concerned with maturity as well as yield. In contrast, the expectations theory assumes that investors are only concerned with yield.
What Is an Unbundled Life Insurance Policy?  

An unbundled life insurance policy is a type of financial protection plan that provides cash to beneficiaries upon a policyholder's death. An unbundled life insurance policy contains a savings and investment component that the policyholder can use during his or her lifetime.



Provisions of the policy do not have expiration dates and the policyholder can adjust the amount and timing of premium payments tied to the amount of the death benefit while the policy is in force. Unbundled life insurance is also called universal life insurance.





Key Takeaways

Unbundled life insurance has a cash value component, in which a portion of each premium payment can be saved and invested on the policyholder's behalf.One of the most noteworthy features of an unbundled life insurance policy is its flexible premiums; the flexibility in premiums is tied to both the option for an adjustable death benefit and the cash value element.Unbundled life insurance policies include the option for a savings component; the savings component will usually have a stated interest-earning rate.Most unbundled life insurance policies come with a policy loan option; the borrowing amount is usually based on the cash value.


   Understanding Unbundled Life Insurance Policy  

Universal/unbundled life insurance is one of several types of permanent life insurance. Unbundled life insurance has a cash value component, in which a portion of each premium payment can be saved and invested on the policyholder's behalf. The other portion of the premium goes toward the death benefit and administrative expenses.



With universal/unbundled life insurance, the premiums and death benefit can be changed during the life of the policy. This can be a desirable feature if the policyholder's needs change. The universal/unbundled policy also clearly discloses the policy's administrative fees—also called underwriting and sales expense charges—to the policyholder, whereas other types of permanent life insurance policies may not.



Within the permanent life insurance category, individuals can choose from whole life, universal/unbundled life, variable life, and variable universal life options. Some of the key benefits of the unbundled life insurance policy include its flexibility and allowance for the policyholder to see exactly where his or her premium payments are going.


   Elements of Unbundled Life Insurance  

Every life insurance policy comes with its own provisions, which can vary by company and type. Some of the basic elements an individual can expect in an unbundled life insurance policy include the following.


  Flexible Premiums  

One of the most noteworthy features of an unbundled life insurance policy is its flexible premiums. The flexibility in premiums is tied to both the option for an adjustable death benefit and the cash value element.



Directly, the premiums are based on the coverage amount and policyholder risks. Unbundled life insurance policies often allow the policyholder to adjust their death benefit and corresponding premium. This allows the policy to be changed with the changing needs of the holder. Premiums can flexibly decrease or increase with decreases or increases in death benefit coverage.


  Cash Value  

Unbundled life insurance policies include the option for a savings component. The savings component will usually have a stated interest-earning rate. Individuals can usually contribute to the cash value at any time or with payments in excess of their stated premium. Payments of the premium can usually also come directly from the cash value for added premium payment flexibility.


  Loan Option  

Most unbundled life insurance policies come with a policy loan option. The borrowing amount is usually based on the cash value. This allows the policyholder to obtain tax-free payouts but requires regular payments at a specified interest rate. Interest rates are often lower than other traditional loan options. The loan can be considered a type of collateralized loan since the life insurance policy and its cash value usually serve as collateral for missed payments and defaults.


  Surrender Options  

A surrender option allows the policyholder to terminate the policy and withdraw their cash value. The cash value is usually subject to surrender charges which can vary depending on the year of termination. Cash values can usually be withdrawn directly by the policyholder. Other alternatives may also exist such as a paid in full life insurance policy death benefit for varying amounts.
What Is Unbundling?  

Unbundling is a process by which a company with several different lines of businesses retains core businesses while selling off, spinning off, or carving out assets, product lines, divisions, or subsidiaries.



Unbundling is done for a variety of reasons, but the goal is always to create a better-performing company or companies. Unbundling may also refer to offering products or services separately that had previously been packaged together.





Key Takeaways

To improve its operations, a company may “unbundle” by selling off assets, product lines, subsidiaries, or divisions. Unbundling may also refer to offering products or services separately that had previously been packaged together.If a company’s share price is performing poorly, the board of directors may call for unbundling to raise capital or distribute cash to its shareholders if they believe the process will help improve its performance.  












Investopedia / Paige McLaughlin


   How Unbundling Works  

The decision to "unbundle" may be called for by the board of directors or by company managers. The board of directors may call for it if the company’s stock is performing poorly, the company needs to raise capital, and/or the company wants to distribute cash to shareholders. 



Unbundling might help the company to become a pure-play for analysts to evaluate. This means focusing on a core offering and can be compared easily to comparables in the industry for benchmarking. This might improve analyst coverage and stock price.



Management might call for unbundling if it thinks the result would help the company perform better. When the board or managers call for unbundling, it often improves the company’s stock price. Unbundling might also occur when one company purchases another for its most valuable divisions but determines it has little use for other aspects of the business.



In some cases, unbundling doesn’t mean a company has sold off its bundled product line, division, or subsidiary. It could mean it has split operations into different businesses while still maintaining control of each business. When this type of unbundling occurs, the newly-formed companies usually have a great opportunity for success in the future. 






A great example of product unbundling is the trend in the mobile phone space where cellphones and cellphone plans are no longer packaged together. 


   Benefits of Unbundling  

Product unbundling may be beneficial for a company looking to expand options for its consumers. For example, a company may offer package deals on products at a discounted rate, but finds not every consumer benefits from the package. The company will decide to unbundle these products to give its customer base a larger selection of items that meets the needs of the consumer. 



When a customer wants less than a bundled package deal, the company may unbundle to meet the needs of the consumer. Whether the company is planning to launch a new offering or unbundle packaged products, it may see an increase in revenue by offering its consumers more. The business may continue to experiment with its unbundled products, while still analyzing its market on recently-bundled products or new offerings based on the needs of the customers. 



Unbundling your products or services offers more choices for your audience by splitting them into multiple offerings tailored to meet the needs of your audience. This helps a business reach different consumers by offering just what they want. Unbundling can also increase revenue in certain cases.


   Example of Unbundling  

When a company unbundles, it may maintain a significant percentage of ownership in the new firm(s). In 2001, Cisco unbundled a division that became Andiamo, but it retained some ownership because it wanted to be involved in the development of a new product line that would give it a competitive advantage.

WHAT IS Unchanged  

Unchanged refers to a situation in which the price or rate of a security is the same between two periods. This can be over any time frame including a trading day, week or even as much as a year. Unchanged is a term used universally among equity, fixed-income, futures and options markets. The term also applies to indexes, exchange-traded funds and the net asset value of mutual funds.



While it is possible to note an unchanged price between two random times, say 3 p.m on a Thursday and then at 10:15 a.m. the following Tuesday, most investors and traders focus on either unchanged intra-day prices, or unchanged closing prices over multiple trading days.


   BREAKING DOWN Unchanged  

Unchanged intraday prices are more common for securities that are fairly illiquid and generally less popular, such as closed-end funds, microcap stocks, and interests in private companies that do not trade on major exchanges. Certain exchange-traded funds are also thinly traded and could be more likely to have unchanged prices.



Conversely, very few stocks on the S&P 500 end a typical day unchanged, or where the session’s opening price and closing price are identical, even during periods of relative market calm.



When choosing two random points on a price chart, it is often possible to hand-select two price points at which prices are identical. In this case, the holding period return between these points will be unchanged. However, this will not take into account the range of peak-to-trough price movements. That is to say, an investor’s return, excluding fees and expenses, is unchanged, but the security price likely moved around quite dramatically between those two points.


   Examples of Unchanged  

For example, say West Texas Intermediate crude, known as WTI, traded at precisely $70.32 at two particular market closes in both October 2008 and May 2018. The holding period return between these two points in time is unchanged. This may be useful to know for an investor who held a long-term futures contract during this precise time frame.



The peak-to-trough price of oil moved dramatically between these two points in time, however, as did underlying supply-and-demand conditions. WTI prices soon crashed to less than $40 in January 2009 amid the Great Recession, climbed back above $100 a barrel in May 2011, then roughly moved sideways until July 2014. Then, prices plunged below $30 in February 2016 as shale-oil extraction lifted inventories, before finally getting back to $70 in May 2018 as those inventories ebbed and inflation began to creep higher.﻿﻿



Through all these gyrations, the holding period return, excluding fees and expenses, is still unchanged.
What Are Unclaimed Funds?  

Unclaimed funds are money and other assets whose rightful owner cannot be located. Unclaimed funds are typically turned over to the government after a specific period of time has passed. To claim the funds or assets, the designated owner or beneficiary must file a claim; if belonging to an estate, it may require the claimant to prove their rights to the unclaimed property or funds.


   Understanding Unclaimed Funds  

There are various reasons why funds and assets go unclaimed. For example, a taxpayer may be owed a refund but the refund check became unclaimed because the taxpayer moved without updating his/her address with the tax authority. Bank failures can create a pool of unclaimed funds when customers are unaware of its closure or do not know who to contact to retrieve their funds. Unclaimed pensions are a common type of unclaimed funds, especially when a company closes and no immediate information is available about the administration of their pensions.



Unclaimed property is essentially property that has gone unclaimed beyond the dormancy period. The dormancy period is the amount of time between when a financial institution reports an account or asset as unclaimed and when the government deems that account or asset to be abandoned. For most states, the dormancy period is five years. When property is officially designated by the state as abandoned or unclaimed, it undergoes a process known as escheatment, where the state assumes ownership of that property until the rightful owner files a claim.



Types of unclaimed property include uncashed payroll checks, inactive stocks, court funds, dividends, checking and savings accounts, and estate proceeds. When property accounts go unclaimed, they are turned over to the state for reasons that may include the death of the account holder, a failure to register a forwarding address after changing residence, or simply forgetting about an account.



Unclaimed property is not taxed while it is filed as unclaimed; however, when it is reclaimed, the property may be officially recognized as taxable income. Some unclaimed funds such as investments from a 401(k) or an IRA can be reclaimed tax-free.





Key Takeaways

Unclaimed funds are those assets where the rightful owner cannot be located.Typically unclaimed funds and property are handed over to the state the assets are located in, after a dormancy period has passed.When claiming unclaimed funds that have risen in value, taxes may be assessed at the time as ordinary income.States have established processes whereby legal owners of assets can reclaim unclaimed funds.


   Unclaimed Funds Example  

Consider an example in which an individual pays estimated federal taxes over the course of a year, files his taxes, and requests any refund be mailed to his home address; before the refund is processed, he moves and fails to disclose his new address to the tax authority. The refund is later processed and mailed to his last known address. To deter fraud, correspondence and payments from tax authorities generally cannot be forwarded. Because of this policy, his undeliverable refund check was returned to the issuer and became an unclaimed fund. The onus now lies with the taxpayer to contact the government to reissue the check to the correct address.



New York State collected $932 million in revenue from unclaimed property in 2018.﻿﻿ While this number is higher than average, the amount of revenue derived by states from misplaced accounts could total between $60 and $80 billion nationwide according to news reports﻿﻿. Data for the state of New York indicates 70% of unclaimed accounts hold less than $100, but there is no limit to account size.﻿﻿ In 2019, Texas returned more than $308 million to owners of previously unclaimed property.﻿﻿ Many claims are more than $100, but not many are likely to match the $32.8 million a Connecticut resident claimed in 2012, proceeds from the sale of stock, according to a 2017 article by Press Connects.﻿﻿


   Verifying Unclaimed Funds  

Governments offer a variety of ways to check for unclaimed funds. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS), for example, allows taxpayers to check the status of a refund online and also offers a hotline that taxpayers can call. Because online refund portals are easier and less expensive to maintain than phone systems, governments may emphasize that customers only call if the delivery of a refund payment extends beyond a reasonable time (e.g. 21 days from receipt).﻿﻿



In the United States, the federal government does not yet have a system available for people to check for unclaimed funds or property. It also does not maintain a centralized database for the purpose of monitoring unclaimed funds on a federal level, nor does it have information about unclaimed funds for each state. Individuals and businesses looking for unclaimed funds will likely have to contact the appropriate state agencies where unclaimed funds or property may exist.



Unbeknownst to many individuals, most, if not all, government agencies are prohibited from contacting owners of unclaimed funds/assets by phone. Because scammers are aware of this limitation, they may attempt to defraud the public. In some instances, such as with unclaimed pensions managed by the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC), the names of individuals owed money are publicly listed. A scam artist may contact these individuals posing as a government employee and may offer to help secure the unclaimed funds for a fee. It is important to know what official agency to contact to verify funds and understand that most are prohibited from calling individuals about their property. A key indicator that someone is attempting to defraud is their request for a fee, a social security number (SSN), or banking information.



Not all unclaimed funds originate with the government. Individuals may have unused money left on gift cards, positive account balances with banks and other financial institutions, and uncollected sales commissions with previous employers. Also, beneficiaries of life insurance policies and other investments are common claimants to unclaimed funds. Businesses that hold onto unclaimed property are typically legally required to attempt to locate the asset owner, but if unsuccessful, may be required to escheat it to a state or local government.
What Is an Ommer Block?  

It's possible for two blocks to be created simultaneously by a network. When this happens, one block will be left out. This leftover block is called an ommer block. In the past, they were called uncle blocks, referring to the familial relationships used to describe block positions within a blockchain.





Key Takeaways

Ommer blocks are created in the Ethereum blockchain when two blocks are created and submitted to the ledger at roughly the same time. Only one can enter the ledger.Ommer blocks are similar to Bitcoin orphans but have an integrated use, unlike their Bitcoin counterparts.Ethereum miners or validators are rewarded for creating ommer blocks in the Ethereum system through transaction fees to pay for their work.


   Understanding Ommer Blocks  

In a public blockchain like Ethereum and Bitcoin, it's essential to use a method that ensures data within the blockchain is verified and added by consensus. It is equally important to keep data from being changed. Many blockchains use a data structure called a Merkle tree to accomplish this.



A Merkle tree establishes ancestral relationships for blocks of data. Information from previous blocks is included in new blocks, similar to DNA passed on between generations. This creates the concept of a parent, parent's sibling, child, and sibling blocks similar to a graphical representation of a family tree.



Here's how it works—the first block in a tree could be named block A. The next block created from block A would be considered block A's child and would include A's information plus its own.






Ethereum is transitioning from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake consensus. Under the proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, ommer blocks may still be produced and have transaction fees rewarded.



This block could be called block B but could be represented as Ba. B is the name of the new block, and "a" refers to the data from the parent block. This parent/child relationship continues as more blocks are added with the information from each previous block. This creates a family tree and blockchain.



Now consider if two blocks were validated and created simultaneously from Ba. They are blocks Cab and Cab2, sibling blocks from the same parent block. Only one can be added to the blockchain—so the network chooses Cab. Cab2 is a fork of the original blockchain but is not added to it or validated. Finally, another block is mined on the blockchain that kept Cab. This is block Dcab. Cab2 is the sibling of Dcab's parent, so Cab2 is an ommer block.


   Special Considerations  

These orphaned blocks were, in essence, bugs in the code—unintended and accidental byproducts of the mining process. However, Ethereum incentivized ommer block miners for several reasons:



To allow for creating more ommer blocks as a byproduct of shorter block times and speed up the network.To decrease the centralization of incentives for large mining pools. These pools employ large mining farms and claim the majority of the cryptocurrency rewards, leaving little for individual miners.To increase the network's security by supplementing the work on the main blockchain by allowing the work done on ommer blocks to be included.



Ommer blocks are purposefully incorporated into Ethereum's blockchain using its consensus mechanism's validation protocol, Casper the Friendly GHOST (Greedy Heaviest Object Sub Tree). When a blockchain fork occurs from simultaneously created blocks, a two-thirds consensus rule from network validators selects which block is used.

What Is an Ommer (Uncle) Block?
Uncle block is the old name for an ommer block. Developers and the Ethereum community decided that there was no reason to have gender-specific names, so they decided on ommer as the new name.




What Is Ethereum's Ommer (Uncle) Rate?
The ommer rate (previously the uncle rate) is the rate at which the network produces ommer blocks. The rate changes daily and depends on the number of transactions occurring.




What Is Ethereum's Ommer (Uncle) Reward?
Under the proof-of-work consensus mechanism, rewards for ommer blocks were a small percentage of the block reward, plus transaction fees. When Ethereum transitions to proof-of-stake, ommer blocks will receive transaction fees.

Who Is Uncle Sam?  

"Uncle Sam" is a personified representation of either the United States federal government or the United States of America in general. In finances, Uncle Sam can refer to a specific tax or regulatory authority—or more specifically, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). One might say, for instance: "I have to pay Uncle Sam a portion of my income to pay for roads and hospitals."





Key Takeaways

Uncle Sam is the personification of the United States federal government, dating back to the 19th century.He's typically depicted as an older gentleman sporting a star-spangled top hat and red bow tie.Uncle Sam is often used colloquially for the IRS, which levies income taxes on American citizens and corporations.One of the most prominent representations of Uncle Sam in popular culture is a poster of him pointing at the viewer with the words "I Want YOU," used for U.S. military recruitment initiatives.Uncle Sam represents the U.S. government whereas Lady Liberty and Columbia represent the U.S. as a nation.


   Understanding Uncle Sam  

A popular etymology first traces the origins of the usage of "Uncle Sam" to early American military history, when it referred to the meat packer Samuel Wilson. Wilson served as an officer during the American Revolutionary War, procuring meat supplies for the Continental Army.



After leaving the army, he and his brother went on to establish a meatpacking house in Troy, New York, which supplied U.S. troops in New York and New Jersey who were fighting against British invaders during the War of 1812. Barrels of Wilson's meat stamped "U.S." were associated with his nickname, Uncle Sam, which in turn became a personification of the national government, as the initials for the United States are also U.S.



Before the 19th century, the U.S. had been personified by the figure "Brother Jonathan," originally a derogatory term for Puritans during the English Civil War. Female representations of the U.S. are also common: Columbia and, since the 20th century, Lady Liberty.


   Uncle Sam in Popular Culture  

Uncle Sam is sometimes used in the financial media to refer to the federal government, particularly in the context of income taxes or financial regulation. Some tax-sheltered products, such as municipal bonds or qualified retirement accounts, are sometimes referred to as "off-limits to Uncle Sam," denoting that they are not subject to taxation by the federal government.



By regulating various financial activities and transactions, such as the Federal Trade Commission's (FTC) oversight of mergers and acquisitions (M&A), Uncle Sam is said to have "had his say" or "given his stamp of approval."















Source: Wikimedia.



The character of Uncle Sam has been widely used in U.S. government propaganda to encourage support for various policies and military efforts over the years, including the financing of these activities, with varying economic impacts.



Uncle Sam was used, for example, to promote the U.S. Treasury's liberty bond program to finance World War I military spending, which one study showed help drive the financialization of the U.S. economy during the early 20th century.






In 1961, Congress passed a resolution recognizing Samuel Wilson as the namesake of the Uncle Sam symbol.



The most popular image of Uncle Sam is based on a World War I military recruiting poster drawn by James Montgomery Flagg, which features a stern Uncle Sam pointing an index finger outward and the words, "I want YOU for U.S. Army." This depiction features an older White man with a white goatee beard wearing an American flag–inspired top hat and red bow tie. His likeness has appeared numerous times since the 1910s.




Was There a Real Uncle Sam?
Uncle Sam is based on a real person named Samuel Wilson, who started a meatpacking company after the American Revolution. His company supplied troops in the War of 1812 with meat, earning him the nickname "Uncle Sam."




What Universal Idea Is the Uncle Sam Poster Meant to Represent?
Uncle Sam is a personification of the U.S. government. He is meant to represent the ideas of the government as opposed to other aspects of the nation, such as liberty and freedom, though the personification in some uses does represent the U.S. as a whole. The famous Uncle Sam poster that points at the viewer stating "I Want YOU" is meant to encourage enlistment in the U.S. military and was prominently used during World War I as well as to encourage the general population to support U.S. entry into the war.




What Special Meanings Do the Statue of Liberty and Uncle Sam Try to Represent?
Uncle Sam aims to represent the U.S. federal government. In that sense, he represents support for the government, taxation, military enlistment, and any other actions taken by the U.S. government. Lady Liberty is meant to represent the ideals of the U.S. as a nation, such as freedom, liberty, equality, and the American Dream.
What Are Uncollected Funds?  

The term "uncollected funds" refers to a portion of a check deposit that remains unavailable to the accountholder who made the deposit until the bank verifies that the funds associated with the deposit have been received by the depositor's bank.



Once the deposited check has cleared the banking system, the funds are deemed to have been collected. At that point, they become part of the accountholder's available balance.





Key Takeaways

Uncollected funds are the unavailable portion of a bank deposit that is in the process of being cleared by the bank.The period of time that funds remain unavailable allows banks to ensure that a deposit by check has been verified and the correct amount of money has been received, or collected.Although there are numerous complaints about uncollected funds, the practice protects banks and their customers from certain types of fraud.A check written against an account with uncollected (and unavailable) funds that is cashed and bounces typically results in an uncollected funds charge.Bank customers who face uncollected funds charges often find them to be unfair and excessive.


   How Uncollected Funds Work  

Uncollected funds are derived from deposits that need to be cleared by the depositor's bank before they're released for use.


  The Check Clearing Process  

The bank must verify that the deposited funds have been received from the bank that issued the check to the payee. Until then, the bank refers to the funds as uncollected funds, coded as "UCF" or "UF" for short, and deposits appear as "pending."



A check for a large amount that is deposited to an account is subject to a hold on most of the amount. A portion typically is made available immediately to the depositor as long as the customer is in good standing with the bank.


  Uncollected Funds Fee  

A check written against an account with uncollected funds that bounces normally results in an uncollected funds charge. This charge is also called a UCF fee and it is usually the same as the bank's non-sufficient funds (NSF) fee. As of 2023, some banks charged NSF and UCF fees that ranged from $30 to $40. However, a growing number of banks have decided to stop charging NSF fees.



No uncollected funds charges are incurred if the available checking account balance can cover checks written against it.


   Benefits of Uncollected Funds  
  Fraud Protection  

Although there are numerous complaints about uncollected funds, they do protect banks and their customers from certain types of fraud.



Without uncollected funds, it would be possible for someone to write a bad check on one bank account, deposit it in another, and then withdraw supposedly available cash.



This scheme is so easy and obvious that normally law-abiding people in need of money, perhaps those facing bankruptcy, might be tempted by it. Even worse, criminals could force innocent people into such schemes and then make them turn over the money.


  Money Management Support  

Uncollected funds are a way for a bank to tell customers that it received a check deposit, but the funds are not yet available. Customers can consider the uncollected funds phase a short waiting period that supports good money management and helps them avoid unnecessary overdrafts.



For example, a customer might deposit a check by sending it to the bank through the mail. When the bank gets the check, it will designate a portion of it as uncollected funds.



When the customer reviews their online banking account, they will see the uncollected funds status and know that the bank received the deposit. The customer can then check back later to see if the funds have cleared. If they've been made available, the customer knows that they can use the money as needed.


  Short-Term Investments  

During the uncollected funds hold period, banks use these funds for short-term investments that can add to their returns and income.


   Criticism of Uncollected Funds  
  Fees Are Unfair  

Customers who face uncollected funds charges often find them to be unfair. When people deposit checks, many of them naturally assume that those deposits instantly become money in the bank that they can spend. From this point of view, an uncollected funds charge is a sneaky way for the bank to make money.


  Fees Are Excessive  

There is also a good argument that UCF fees are excessive. The fact that they can be the same amount as NSF fees is particularly irksome.



A person writing a bad check normally has no reason to believe it will clear, while someone with uncollected funds might think their money is available.



Furthermore, there might be little or nothing in an account with insufficient funds, leaving the bank with a loss and a need to collect. On the other hand, it is easy for the bank to take UCF fees out of the uncollected funds when they are cleared, which usually happens within a few days.


  Hold Periods Are Uncertain  

Since uncollected funds are not available right away, when do they become available? In a day? In a week? Check clearing times can be hard to determine and a source of frustration for customers. Granted, this was more of an issue before online banking made it easier to determine the status of deposited checks. Still, not everyone banks online so indeterminate holding periods may continue to be an issue for some.






The best way to avoid uncollected funds charges (UCF fees) is to check your account balance online after making a deposit. Make sure the deposit is part of the available balance rather than uncollected funds before spending it.


   Examples of Uncollected Funds  

Example 1: Jack, a longtime customer of Hometown Community Bank, deposits a $1,000 check on Monday. $100 is available for withdrawal right away. However, the $900 balance is designated as uncollected funds, so Jack must wait until the check clears later in the week to draw upon that amount. If Jack tries to write a check against the balance and it has not yet cleared, Jack will incur an uncollected funds charge.



Example 2: Christine runs a small graphic design company. A new client sends her a check for services rendered. Christine deposits the check into the company's business account knowing that the money is seen as uncollected funds and won't be available immediately. Because the client’s bank isn't local, it takes a day longer than normal for the check to clear. But business is good and she can use existing funds in the account for her spending needs until the uncollected funds are verified, collected, and become available to her.


   Uncollected Funds vs. Insufficient Funds  

It is crucial to make a distinction between uncollected funds and insufficient funds. Unlike uncollected funds, an account with insufficient funds will not show a deposit pending. Such an account does not have enough money in it to meet demands against it.



Writing a check against an account with insufficient funds will always result in a bounced check and incur a fee. In fact, people who knowingly write a check against an account with insufficient funds may be committing a crime.



On the other hand, writing a check against an account with uncollected funds can work if the check is not cashed until after the uncollected funds have cleared.




How Long Can Banks Put a Hold on Uncollected Funds?
According to the U.S. Office of the Comptroller, banks must make $225 from your deposit available the day after you make the deposit. And then, normally, the uncollected funds should be available on the second business day after the deposit was made. Holds can be extended if there is cause for concern involving the funds or the accountholder or the source of the money for deposit.




What Does Uncollected Mean?
It refers to the fact that the funds relating to a bank deposit made by an accountholder have not yet been received—collected—from the bank that issued the check for deposit. Movement of money, even electronically, must be verified, or cleared, by financial institutions before that money can be made available to customers.




Is Writing a Check on an Account With Uncollected Funds a Crime?
Not if there are available funds in the account that can cover the check. And if a check bounces, most accountholders will be charged a UCF fee rather than with a crime.


   The Bottom Line  

Uncollected funds are the part of any bank deposit that is normally quarantined for a short period of time and unavailable for use by a bank customer until the deposit clears.



The purpose of the uncollected funds phase is to ensure that the money related to a deposited check actually makes it into the bank account before it is spent. This practice can protect banks and customers from fraud, function as a basic money management tool for accountholders, and provide banks with a short-term investment window for added returns.
What Is an Uncommitted Facility?  

An uncommitted facility is an agreement between a lender and a borrower where the lender agrees to make short-term funding available to the borrower. This is unlike a committed facility that involves clearly defined terms and conditions set forth by the lending institution and imposed on the borrower. Uncommitted facilities are used to finance seasonal or temporary needs of businesses with fluctuating revenues, such as paying creditors to earn trade discounts, single or one-off transactions, and meeting payroll obligations.





Key Takeaways

Uncommitted facilities lending arrangments used to fund short-term needs, such as payroll.Term loans are a common committed facility, which can include equipment, working capital, and equipment loans. Uncommitted facilities are cheaper to set up than committed facilities.An uncommitted facility can include a working capital facility, also known as an overdraft, and is payable on demand. 


   How an Uncommitted Facility Works  

Because small businesses may struggle to have adequate monthly cash flow, an uncommitted facility may help them operate until they establish a stronger presence in the marketplace and increase their annual revenues.



Uncommitted facilities are generally less costly to arrange, compared to committed facilities, because the lender has no obligation to extend the loan; when financing is made available, it is short term, and the credit risk is comparatively small.


   Uncommitted Facility vs. Committed Facility  

A term loan from a bank, a committed facility, is for a specific amount with a specified repayment schedule and a fixed or variable interest rate. For example, many banks have long-term programs offering small businesses the cash necessary for monthly operations. In many cases, a small business uses cash for purchasing fixed assets such as production equipment.



A term loan for equipment, real estate or working capital is paid off within one to 25 years through a monthly or quarterly repayment schedule. The loan requires collateral and a rigorous approval process for reducing the risk of repayment. The loan is appropriate for established small businesses with sound financial statements and a substantial down payment for minimizing payment amounts and total loan cost.


   Example of an Uncommitted Facility  

An overdraft, or working capital facility, solve companies’ short-term cash flow issues. The bank or other financial institution decides whether to lend money and the limit. Because an overdraft is typically payable on demand, it is unsuitable for purposes such as funding a major acquisition. The lender typically does not call in the overdraft unless the borrower’s financial position or activities give the lender reasons for concern.



Receiving an overdraft is typically a simple process. However, there is always uncertainty about whether the bank will lend to a specific business and when the lender will demand repayment. Plus, a limited amount of capital may be borrowed, and lender charges may be high. Also, the borrower typically has little room for amending the lender’s standard form for issuing an overdraft. In addition, the borrower may have to reduce the overdraft to a set amount for a particular number of days to ensure it is used only for short-term cash flow issues.
What Is Unconditional Probability?  

An unconditional probability is the chance that a single outcome results among several possible outcomes. The term refers to the likelihood that an event will take place irrespective of whether any other events have taken place or any other conditions are present.



The probability that snow will fall in Jackson, Wyoming, on Groundhog Day, without taking into consideration the historical weather patterns and climate data for northwestern Wyoming in early February is an example of an unconditional probability.



Unconditional probability may be contrasted with conditional probability.





Key Takeaways

Unconditional probability reflects the chance that some event will occur without accounting for any other possible influences or prior outcomes.For instance, the chance of a fair coin flip being heads has an unconditional probability of 50% regardless of how many coin flips preceded it, nor if some other event had occurred.Unconditional probability is also known as marginal probability.


   Understanding Unconditional Probability  

The unconditional probability of an event can be determined by adding up the outcomes of the event and dividing by the total number of possible outcomes.

P(A) = Total Number of Possible OutcomesNumber of Times ‘A’ Occurs​
Unconditional probability is also known as marginal probability and measures the chance of an occurrence ignoring any knowledge gained from previous or external events. Since this probability ignores new information, it remains constant.
Conditional probability, on the other hand, is the likelihood of an event or outcome occurring, but based on the occurrence of some other event or prior outcome. Conditional probability is calculated by multiplying the probability of the preceding event by the updated probability of the succeeding, or conditional, event.
Conditional probability is often portrayed as the "probability of A given B," notated as P(A|B). Unconditional probability also differs from joint probability, which calculates the likelihood of two or more outcomes occurring simultaneously and is portrayed as the "probability of A and B", written as P(A ∩ B). It essentially incorporates the unconditional probabilities of A and B.


   Example of Unconditional Probability  

As a hypothetical example from finance, let's examine a group of stocks and their returns. A stock can either be a winner, which earns a positive return, or a loser, which has a negative returns. Say that out of five stocks, stocks A and B are winners, while stocks C, D, and E are losers. What, then, is the unconditional probability of choosing a winning stock? Since two outcomes out of a possible five will produce a winner, the unconditional probability is 2 successes divided by 5 total outcomes (2 / 5 = 0.4), or 40%.
What Is an Unconsolidated Subsidiary?  

An unconsolidated subsidiary is a company that is owned by a parent company but whose individual financial statements are not included in the consolidated or combined financial statements of the parent company to which it belongs. Instead, an unconsolidated subsidiary appears in the consolidated financial statements of the parent as an investment. This usually applies when the parent company does not have a controlling stake in the subsidiary.





Key Takeaways

Unconsolidated subsidiaries are owned by a parent company, but their individual financial statements are not included in the consolidated financial statements of the parent company.Rather than their individual financial statements, unconsolidated subsidiaries appear as investments on the parent company's consolidated financial statements.Companies are considered to be unconsolidated subsidiaries when the parent company is not in control of the subsidiary, has only temporary control, or if the parent's business operations are different than that of the subsidiary.Depending on the equity stake of the parent company in the subsidiary, the investment has to be recorded either using the equity method or the historic cost method.Parent companies most often have less than a 50% ownership stake in the unconsolidated subsidiary. The accounting method used depends if the ownership stake is more or less than 20%.


   Understanding an Unconsolidated Subsidiary  

A company may be treated as an unconsolidated subsidiary when the parent company is not in control of a subsidiary, has temporary control of the subsidiary, or if the parent company's business operations are considerably different than that of the subsidiary.



Different accounting treatments apply, depending on the percentage owned by the parent company. The ownership stake, however, is always less than 50%. If the ownership stake is 20% or more (but less than 50%), the parent typically can exert some type of control over the subsidiary.



Here, the parent will use the equity method of accounting as the unconsolidated subsidiary is treated as an investment with more than 20% ownership in the voting stock of the subsidiary. This is known as an influential investment. Under this method, the parent must record any profit or losses realized from the subsidiary on its income statement.



Parent companies with less than a 20% stake and no control of the subsidiary merely record the investment at historical cost or the purchase price on its balance sheet. This is known as a passive investment. However, if dividends are paid, which are cash payments to shareholders, the parent records the dividend income but does not record any investment income earned from the subsidiary.


   Reasons to Have an Unconsolidated Subsidiary  

Most often, a parent company will create the unconsolidated subsidiary itself. There are a variety of reasons it may do so, including creating joint ventures (JVs) to split costs with another company or special purpose vehicles (SPVs) to segregate revenues, costs, and profits for special projects from that of the parent company.






When a subsidiary or affiliated entity is a sizable operation, a parent company’s financial statements may not fully reflect its true exposure to all attached elements of its business.



While a parent company may not have managerial control of a subsidiary, it could have significant exposure to the financial and operational dealings of the subsidiary. For instance, a multinational enterprise may experience political risk in another region. From an accounting sense, it might not make sense to account for the subsidiary beyond an investment on a parent’s financial statements, but the exposure does extend to the parent’s core business.


   Example of an Unconsolidated Subsidiary  

As an example, let's say that Company ABC has a 40% controlling interest in its unconsolidated subsidiary, Business XYZ, which it created as an SPV for a new construction project in a foreign country that will only last for a year.



XYZ records $1 billion in profits for the year. Because ABC owns more than 20% of XYZ (but less than 50%), it will use the equity method of accounting for its unconsolidated subsidiary. ABC must record $400 million in earnings on its income statement since ABC has a 40% stake and exerts some control over XYZ. Also, ABC needs to record the increase in the value of the initial investment, listed on the balance sheet, by $400 million.
What is Unconstrained Investing?  

Unconstrained investing is an investment style that does not require a fund or portfolio manager to adhere to a specific benchmark. Unconstrained investing allows managers to pursue returns across many asset classes and sectors.





Key Takeaways

Unconstrained investing allows fund managers to pursue investment themes and ideas without tying them to a specific performance benchmark such as the S&P 500 Index.This flexibility gives managers the ability to take advantage of market changes in a timely manner.However, it also increases investment manager risk. Managers who operate more independently could make poor decisions that hurt a portfolio.


   Understanding Unconstrained Investing  

Unconstrained investing rose to prominence, in part, from the mistrust surrounding the 2007-2008 Financial Crisis. Investors were wary of the market, as well as benchmarks, such as the S&P 500 Index or Russell 2000. Finance professionals often use benchmarks in investing to determine whether the performances of the portfolios they select and manage are meeting expectations.



Fund and portfolio managers generally stuck closely to specific guidelines and measured their performance against fixed benchmarks. This inflexibility meant that managers were not always able to take advantage of market changes in a timely manner. It also meant that portfolio managers were highly invested in the U.S. market, which happened to be sitting on top of a subprime mortgage bomb that seriously shook up the financial markets when it went off.


   Unconstrained Investing as an Alternative Style  

Unconstrained investing focuses on performance over time, rather than on short-term gains. It also eschews constraints that arise by focusing on benchmark tracking.



For example, in the case of fixed-income investing, managers are not required to adhere to specific bond ratings, currencies, or sectors as these requirements may only apply to a portion of the portfolio. Bond portfolio managers are allowed to use derivatives to hedge against price and rate ranges, as well as to bet against the market throughput and call options.



This can cause portfolios to see an increase in investment manager risk, since inexperienced managers without guidelines or those operating more independently could make poor decisions that affect the value of the portfolio. Managers are entrusted with understanding not only how different asset classes and sectors interact, but also how different geographies and governments impact performance.



It is worth noting that there will still be internal performance metrics and controls designed to measure and control risks. The main difference is that a popular market benchmark will not be the main focus of the metrics.


   Access to Unconstrained Investing Styles  

While some teams develop their own unconstrained investing styles, established asset managers like J.P. Morgan also have unconstrained strategies that many accredited and high-net-worth individuals can place their money with.



On its website, J.P. Morgan describes how its managers that pursue unconstrained investing strategies are able to research and develop their best ideas, across a wide range of asset classes, security types, and sectors.﻿﻿ Another way to describe unconstrained investing is a multi-sector, multi-asset, global approach.
What Is an Unconventional Cash Flow?  

An unconventional cash flow is a series of inward and outward cash flows over time in which there is more than one change in the cash flow direction. This contrasts with a conventional cash flow, where there is only one change in the cash flow direction.





Key Takeaways

An unconventional cash flow is a change in the direction of a company's cash flow over time from an inward cash flow to an outward cash flow or vice versa.An unconventional cash flow makes capital budgeting difficult because it requires more than one internal rate of return (IRR).Most projects have a conventional cash flow; one outflow of cash, which is the capital investment, and then multiple inflows of cash, which are the revenues.


   Understanding an Unconventional Cash Flow  

In terms of mathematical notations, where the "-" sign represents an outflow and "+" denotes an inflow, an unconventional cash flow could appear as -, +, +, +, -, +, or alternatively, +, -, -, +, -, -. This would indicate the first set has a net inflow of cash and the second set has a net outflow of cash. If the first set represented cash flows in the first financial quarter and the second set represented cash flows in the second financial quarter, the change in direction of the cash flows would indicate an unconventional cash flow for the company.



Cash flows are modeled for net present value (NPV) in a discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis in capital budgeting to help determine if the initial investment cost for a project will be worthwhile when compared to the NPV of the future cash flows generated from the project.



Unconventional cash flows are more difficult to handle in an NPV analysis than a conventional cash flow since it will produce multiple internal rates of return (IRR), depending on the number of changes in the cash flow direction.



In real-life situations, examples of unconventional cash flows are abundant, especially in large projects where periodic maintenance may involve huge outlays of capital. For example, a large thermal power generation project where cash flows are being projected over a 25-year period may have cash outflows for the first three years during the construction phase, inflows from years four to 15, an outflow in year 16 for scheduled maintenance, followed by inflows until year 25.


   Challenges Posed by an Unconventional Cash Flow  

A project with a conventional cash flow starts with a negative cash flow (investment period), where there is only one outflow of cash, the initial investment. This is followed by successive periods of positive cash flows where all the cash flows are inflows, which are the revenues from the project.



A single IRR can be calculated from this type of project, with the IRR compared to a company's hurdle rate to determine the economic attractiveness of the contemplated project. However, if a project is subject to another set of negative cash flows in the future, there will be two IRRs, which will cause decision uncertainty for management. For example, if the IRRs are 5% and 15%, and the hurdle rate is 10%, management will not have the confidence to go ahead with the investment.
What Is Unconventional Oil?  

In the oil and gas industry, the term “unconventional oil” refers to crude oil that is obtained through methods other than traditional vertical well extraction.



Examples of such methods include developing oil sands, directional drilling, and hydraulic fracturing (colloquially known as “fracking”), among others. Today, unconventional oil is becoming increasingly common, driven by new technological developments as well as economic considerations, making it more cost-effective and profitable. Some people, however, have concerns that unconventional oil extraction methods may be harmful to the environment.





Key Takeaways

Unconventional oil is crude oil that is extracted using relatively new and/or complex methods.Historically, unconventional oil was associated with periods of relatively high oil prices, in which costlier methods could be economically justified.It is increasingly the case, however, that the technological advances obtained through unconventional oil extraction have been implemented throughout mainstream oil production practices—such as in the case of directional drilling techniques.


   How Unconventional Oil Works  

There are two primary reasons why unconventional oil has become increasingly common in recent years. The first has to do with the economic climate surrounding the oil extraction industry. For instance, in periods when the price of oil is relatively low, companies face pressures to develop new technological means of extracting oil more efficiently. 



In practice, this means increasing the speed and reliability of equipment, reducing the reliance on personnel through increased automation, developing new techniques that reduce the amount of equipment or personnel altogether, or some combination of the above. All of these developments can cause the methods used for oil extraction to differ substantially from the traditional vertical wells used in conventional oil extraction. Directional drilling techniques, for example, have allowed companies to access multiple underground reserves using a single vertical well—something which would have required multiple vertical drill sites in the past.



The same is true when oil prices are persistently high. In those circumstances, oil reserves that had previously been considered too difficult to be exploited economically may suddenly find themselves to be commercially viable targets. For example, increased oil costs helped encourage the development of the techniques now known as hydraulic fracturing, which involves using steam, gas, and chemical injections to break up rock formations and extract the hydrocarbons contained within them.



Ultimately, it seems inevitable that a growing percentage of oil extraction techniques will come to be seen as “unconventional” by historical standards. As oil becomes increasingly scarce and challenged by alternative energy sources such as solar, wind, and nuclear power, it is likely that the techniques for oil extraction will continue to change, and the industry works to continuously improve the efficiency of its production methods.


   Example of Unconventional Oil: Fracking  

Perhaps the most famous example of unconventional oil extraction is hydraulic fracturing, which was first invented in 1947 by engineers at the Stanolind Oil and Gas Corporation. The basic premise of hydraulic fracturing is that it is possible to create newly accessible reserves of oil by releasing the hydrocarbons that are trapped within underground rock formations. 



This is done by injecting highly pressurized fracking fluid into a well which then creates fissures in an underground rock formation. The resulting oil, which escapes from the fissures, then gradually flows up through the well in the direction of the low-pressure surface. The movement of the oil toward the surface is further accelerated by artificially increasing the pressure inside the underground reservoir while also using chemical injections to adjust the viscosity of the oil.


   Example of Unconventional Oil: Oil Sands  

Another example is oil sands. Also known as "tar sands," these refer to soil and rock material that contains crude bitumen, a dense, viscous form of crude oil. Bitumen is too thick to flow on its own, so specialized extraction methods are necessary. As a result, recovering usable crude oil from oil sands is a complex and expensive method of extraction. However, technological advances have made it less expensive over time, and when oil prices are expensive in the market, this type of unconventional oil becomes profitable.



Oil sands are found primarily in the Athabasca, Cold Lake, and Peace River regions of northern Alberta and Saskatchewan, Canada, and in areas of Venezuela, Kazakhstan, and Russia. Bitumen is extracted and processed using two methods, mining and in situ.
What Is Uncovered Interest Arbitrage?  

Uncovered interest arbitrage is a form of arbitrage that involves switching from a domestic currency that carries a lower interest rate to a foreign currency that offers a higher rate of interest on deposits. With uncovered interest arbitrage, there is a foreign exchange risk implicit in this transaction since the investor or speculator will need to convert the foreign currency deposit proceeds back into the domestic currency sometime in the future.



The term "uncovered" in this arbitrage refers to the fact that this foreign exchange risk is not covered through a forward or futures contract.





Key Takeaways

Uncovered interest arbitrage is a form of arbitrage that involves switching from a domestic currency that carries a lower interest rate to a foreign currency that offers a higher rate of interest on deposits.The term "uncovered" in this arbitrage refers to the fact that this foreign exchange risk is not covered through a forward or futures contract.Uncovered interest arbitrage involves an unhedged exchange of currencies in an effort to earn higher returns due to an interest rate differential between the two currencies. 


   How Uncovered Interest Arbitrage Works  

Uncovered interest arbitrage involves an unhedged exchange of currencies in an effort to earn higher returns due to an interest rate differential between the two currencies. Total returns from uncovered interest arbitrage depend considerably on currency fluctuations since adverse currency movements can wipe out all the gains and in fact even lead to negative returns. If the interest rate differential obtained by investing in a foreign currency is 3%, and the foreign currency appreciates against the domestic currency by 2% during the holding period, the total return from this arbitrage activity is 5%. On the other hand, if the foreign currency depreciates by 4% during the holding period, the total return is -1%.
What Is Uncovered Interest Rate Parity (UIP)?  

Uncovered interest rate parity (UIP) theory states that the difference in interest rates between two countries will equal the relative change in currency foreign exchange rates over the same period. It is one form of interest rate parity (IRP) used alongside covered interest rate parity.



If the uncovered interest rate parity relationship does not hold, then there is an opportunity to make a risk-free profit using currency arbitrage or Forex arbitrage.





Key Takeaways

Uncovered interest rate parity (UIP) is a fundamental equation in economics that governs the relationship between foreign and domestic interest rates and currency exchange rates.The basic premise of interest rate parity is that, in a global economy, the price of goods should be the same everywhere (the law of one price) once interest rates and currency exchange rates are factored.UIP can be contrasted with covered interest rate parity, which involves using forward contracts to hedge exchange rates for forex traders.

  How to Calculate Interest Rate Parity  

Forward exchange rates for currencies are exchange rates at a future point in time, as opposed to spot exchange rates, which are current rates. An understanding of forward rates is fundamental to interest rate parity, especially as it pertains to arbitrage (the simultaneous purchase and sale of an asset in order to profit from a difference in the price).



Forward rates are available from banks and currency dealers for periods ranging from less than a week to as far out as five years and beyond. As with spot currency quotations, forwards are quoted with a bid-ask spread.



The difference between the forward rate and spot rate is known as swap points. If this difference (forward rate minus spot rate) is positive, it is known as a forward premium; a negative difference is termed a forward discount.



A currency with a lower interest rate will trade at a forward premium in relation to a currency with a higher interest rate. For example, the U.S. dollar typically trades at a forward premium against the Canadian dollar; conversely, the Canadian dollar trades at a forward discount versus the U.S. dollar.


   What Does Uncovered Interest Rate Parity Tell You?  

Uncovered interest rate parity conditions consist of two return streams, one from the foreign money market interest rate on the investment and one from the change in the foreign currency spot rate. Said another way, uncovered interest rate parity assumes foreign exchange equilibrium, thus implying that the expected return of a domestic asset (i.e., a risk-free rate like a U.S. Treasury Bill or T-Bill) will equal the expected return of a foreign asset after adjusting for the change in foreign currency exchange spot rates.



When uncovered interest rate parity holds, there can be no excess return earned from simultaneously going long a higher-yielding currency investment and shorting a different lower-yielding currency investment or interest rate spread. Uncovered interest rate parity assumes that the country with the higher interest rate or risk-free money market yield will experience depreciation in its domestic currency relative to the foreign currency.



UIP is related to the so-called "law of one price," which is an economic theory that states the price of an identical security, commodity, or product traded anywhere in the world should have the same price regardless of location when currency exchange rates are taken into consideration—if it is traded in a free market with no trade restrictions.



The "law of one price" exists because differences between asset prices in different locations should eventually be eliminated due to the arbitrage opportunity. The law of one price theory is the underpinning of the concept of purchasing power parity (PPP). Purchasing power parity states that the value of two currencies is equal when a basket of identical goods is priced the same in both countries. This relates to a formula that can be applied to compare securities across markets that trade in different currencies. As exchange rates can shift frequently, the formula can be recalculated on a regular basis to identify mispricings across various international markets.


   The Difference Between Covered Interest Rate Parity and Uncovered Interest Rate Parity  

Covered interest parity (CIP) involves using forward or futures contracts to cover exchange rates, which can thus be hedged in the market. Meanwhile, uncovered interest rate parity (UIP) involves forecasting rates and not covering exposure to foreign exchange risk—that is, there are no forward rate contracts, and it uses only the expected spot rate.



There is no theoretical difference between covered and uncovered interest rate parity when the forward and expected spot rates are the same.


   Limitations of Uncovered Interest Parity  

There is only limited evidence to support UIP, but economists, academics, and analysts still use it as a theoretical and conceptual framework to represent rational expectation models. UIP requires the assumption that capital markets are efficient.



Empirical evidence has shown that over the short- and medium-term time periods, the level of depreciation of the higher-yielding currency is less than the implications of uncovered interest rate parity. Many times, the higher-yielding currency has strengthened instead of weakened.
What is an Uncovered Option?  

In option trading, the term "uncovered" refers to an option that does not have an offsetting position in the underlying asset. Uncovered option positions are always written options, or in other words options where the initiating action is a sell order. This is also known as selling a naked option.





Key Takeaways

Uncovered options are sold, or written, options where the seller does not have a position in the underlying security.Selling this kind of option creates the risk that the seller may have to quickly acquire a position in the security when the option buyer wants to exercise the option. The risk of an uncovered option is that the profit potential is limited, but the loss potential may generate a loss that is multiple times the greatest profit that can be made.


   How an Uncovered Option works  

Any trader who sells an option has a potential obligation. That obligation is met, or covered, by having a position in the security that underlies the option. If the trader sells the option but has no position in the underlying security, then the position is said to be uncovered, or naked.



Traders who buy a simple call or put option have no obligation to exercise that option. However those traders who sell those same options do have an obligation to provide a position in the underlying asset if the traders to whom they sold the options do actually exercise their options. This can be true for put or call options.



An uncovered or naked put strategy is inherently risky because of the limited upside profit potential, and at the same time holding a significant downside loss potential, theoretically. The risk exists because maximum profit is achievable if the underlying price closes at or above the strike price at expiration. Further increases in the cost of the underlying security will not result in any additional profit. The maximum loss is theoretically significant because the price of the underlying security can fall to zero. The higher the strike price, the higher the loss potential.



An uncovered or naked call strategy is also inherently risky, as there is limited upside profit potential and, theoretically, unlimited downside loss potential. Maximum profit will be achieved if the underlying price falls to zero. The maximum loss is theoretically unlimited because there is no cap on how high the price of the underlying security can rise.



An uncovered options strategy stands in direct contrast to a covered options strategy. When investors write a covered put, they will keep a short position in the underlying security for the put option. Also, the underlying security and the puts are sold or shorted, in equal quantities. A covered put works in virtually the same way as a covered call. The exception is that the underlying position is a short instead of a long position, and the option sold is a put rather than a call.



However, in more practical terms, the seller of uncovered puts, or calls, will likely repurchase them well before the price of the underlying security moves adversely too far away from the strike price, based on their risk tolerance and stop loss settings.


   Using Uncovered Options  

Uncovered options are suitable only for experienced, knowledgeable investors who understand the risks and can afford substantial losses. Margin requirements are often quite high for this strategy, due to the capacity for significant losses. Investors who firmly believe the price for the underlying security, usually a stock, will rise, in the case of uncovered puts, or fall, in the case of uncovered calls, or stay the same may write options to earn the premium.



With uncovered puts, if the stock persists above the strike price between the option's writing and the expiration, then the writer will keep the entire premium, minus commissions. The writer of an uncovered call will keep the whole premium, minus commissions, if the stock persists below the strike price between writing the option and its expiration.



The breakeven point for an uncovered put option is the strike price minus the premium. Breakeven for the uncovered call is the strike price plus the premium. This small window of opportunity would give the option seller little leeway if they were incorrect.


   Example of an Uncovered Put  

When the price of the stock falls below the strike price before, or by, the expiration date, the buyer of the options product can demand the seller take delivery of shares of the underlying stock. The options seller must go to the open market to sell those shares at the market price loss, even though the option writer paid the strike price. For example, imagine the strike price is $60, and the open market price for the stock is $55 at the time the options contract is exercised. The options seller will incur a loss of $5 per share of stock.
What is an Undated Issue?  

An undated issue is a government bond that has no maturity date resulting in interest payments that last into perpetuity.





Key Takeaways

An undated issue is a government bond that has no maturity date resulting in interest payments that last into perpetuity.An undated issue can function, from the bond holder’s perspective, much like a dividend-paying stock.Banks consider undated issues to be a form of Tier 1 capital as they help banks fulfill their capital reserve requirements.


   Understanding Undated Issue  

Technically speaking, the pre-established, agreed-upon term for which an undated issue will pay interest is, essentially, “forever.” An undated issue can function, from the bond holder’s perspective, much like a dividend-paying stock, since the holder will continue to receive interest payments on a recurring, ongoing basis for a long period of time. For obvious reasons, undated issues are sometimes also known as perpetual bonds, or just “perps” for short.



While the government can redeem an undated issue if it so chooses, it would usually not exercise this option. Since most existing undated issues have very low coupons, there is little or no incentive for redemption. Undated issues are treated as equity for all practical purposes due to their perpetual nature, as opposed to being treated as debt. One difference that sets these bonds apart from other forms of equity, though, is that they come with no corresponding vote attached, so the holder has no voting-related influence or control over the issuing entity.



Banks consider undated issues to be a form of Tier 1 capital, a category that includes equity capital and disclosed reserves. This means that these bonds are useful in helping banks to fulfill their capital reserve requirements.



Undated issues continue to be offered in the current financial landscape, but they are not as in demand as the more popular financial instruments such as municipal bonds or Treasury bonds.


   Undated Issues in History  

Undated issues have been around for a long time. Many financial historians credit the British government for creating the concept, or at least for introducing the first widely recognized examples. Financial experts recorded the first British release of undated issues back in the 18th century.



Perhaps the best-known undated issues are the U.K. Government's undated bonds or gilts, also referred to as gilt-edged securities. Up until fairly recently, there were eight issues in existence, some of which dated back to the 19th Century. The largest of these issues in recent times was the War Loan, with an issue size of £1.9 billion and a coupon rate of 3.5 percent that was issued in the early 20th century. However, undated gilts have now become a part of financial nostalgia in the UK. The last remaining undated bonds in the UK portfolio were redeemed in July 2015, as part of a program initiated by the British chancellor.﻿﻿
What Is Under Reporting?  

Under reporting is a term describing the crime of intentionally reporting less income or revenue than was actually received. Companies and individuals chiefly under report their incomings in an effort to avoid or reduce their respective tax liabilities.



Under reporting is not a victimless crime. In fact, the billions of dollars of tax-loss revenue caused by under reporting reduces the funds the federal government relies on to finance Social Security, Medicare, and a host of other programs.





Key Takeaways

Under reporting is the deliberate criminal act of reporting less income or revenue than was actually received.  The tax loss revenue that results from under reporting may ultimately slash the funds that Social Security, Medicare, and other federal programs need to finance their outgoing expenditures.Under reporting may be committed by public companies and by individuals alike.Those who purposely under report may face fiscal penalties, criminal consequences, or both.


   Understanding Under Reporting  

If a struggling public company experiences a sharp drop in its share price, it may report even lower revenues for a fiscal quarter than it actually earned during that time period. This is done merely for optical purposes. The trick is to hide revenues and then subsequently lump those hidden figures with the revenues in the following quarter's earnings statement, so that onlookers are led to believe that the company has rebounded and is now in much better shape.



The appearance of a more successful quarter can inspire investors, and ultimately boost a company's stock price. Naturally, this form of under reporting is also an illegal practice.



Companies listed on stock exchanges aren't the only culprits. In fact, in most cases, it's usually self-employed filers and those who earn cash income that are most likely to under report their incomes. The primary goal here is to reduce tax liabilities and pocket a higher percentage of any money made.






Wage and salary employees typically do not under report their incomes, because their earnings are usually directly reported to the IRS by third parties--namely, their employers.



During the 1990s, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) estimated that as much as 84% of cash tips, worth hundreds of millions of dollars each year, were going unreported. And in 2019, the U.S. tax authority revealed that under reporting accounted for about $352 billion of the United States' $441 billion tax gap—the difference between taxes owed and taxes actually paid—in the 2011-2013 tax years.






Under reporting accounted for approximately 80% of the U.S. tax gap in the 2011-2013 tax years.


   Consequences of Under Reporting  

Individuals and companies that are caught under reporting may be subject to fiscal penalties, and in extreme cases, might even face criminal charges.



However, it's important to remember that under reporting is only a crime if offenders willfully disregard the tax code. If this action occurs due to negligence or calculation errors, the IRS could penalize the under reporting company or individual without initiating criminal action against those parties.



For example, if a waitress one night distractedly back pockets a few bills, rather than consolidating them with the rest of her take, this act of negligence won't likely result in criminal punishment. Only if investigators determine that willful tax evasion or fraud has occurred will that waitress be at risk of a felony conviction.
What Is Underapplied Overhead?  

The term underapplied overhead refers to a situation that arises when overhead expenses amount to more than what a company actually budgets for in order to run its operations. Underapplied overhead is normally reported as a prepaid expense on a company's balance sheet and is balanced by inputting a debit to the cost of goods sold (COGS) section by the end of the year. Costs of goods sold are the direct cost associated with the production of goods sold by a company. The amount of underapplied overhead is referred to as an unfavorable variance.





Key Takeaways

Underapplied overhead occurs when overhead expenses are more than what a company actually budgets.This figure is reported on a company's balance sheet as a prepaid expense or short-term asset as a debit, then offset by a debit to the cost of goods sold before the end of the fiscal year and a credit to prepaid expenses.Underapplied overhead is an unfavorable variance because a business goes over budget.It is generally not considered negative because analysts and managers look for patterns that may point to changes in the business environment or economic cycle.


   Understanding Underapplied Overhead  

Before looking at how underapplied overhead works, it's important to define overhead costs. The term overhead is used to describe the costs associated with running a business. More specifically, these are expenses that a business incurs for its day-to-day operations but are not directly linked to the creation of a product or service. Overhead is important for businesses for a number of reasons including budgeting and how much to charge their customers in order to realize a profit.



Underapplied overhead occurs when a business doesn't budget enough for its overhead costs. This means the budgeted amount is less than the amount the business actually spends on its operations. For example, when a company incurs $150,000 in overhead after budgeting only $100,000, it has an underapplied overhead of $50,000. This is referred to as an unfavorable variance because it means that the budgeted costs were lower than actual costs. Put simply, the business went over budget making the cost of goods sold more than expected.



As noted above, underapplied overhead is reported on a company's balance sheet as a prepaid expense or a short-term asset. This debit item on the balance sheet must be offset at a future date. In order to reconcile this, the company's accounting department generally inputs a debit by the end of the year to the COGS section and a credit to the prepaid expenses section.



When underapplied overhead appears on financial statements, it is generally not considered a negative event. Rather, analysts and interested managers look for patterns that may point to changes in the business environment or economic cycle. Should unfavorable variance or outcomes arise—because not enough product was produced to absorb all overhead costs incurred—managers will first look for viable reasons. These may be explained by expected hiccups in production, business, or seasonal variation.






The initial predetermined overhead cost rate is calculated by taking the budgeted overhead costs divided by the budgeted activity.


   Special Considerations  

Analyzing underapplied overhead takes on greater significance for certain businesses such as manufacturing. Often as part of standard financial planning and analysis (FP&A) activities, careful review on underapplied overhead can point to meaningful changes in operational and financial conditions. These can be useful in assessing capital budgeting decisions and the allocation of limited resources from time, money, and human capital.



Advancements in electronic inventory and production management systems have greatly eased the burden of comprehensive operational reporting, often including underapplied overhead analysis. These improvements allow managers to better assess key operational metrics.


   Underapplied Overhead vs. Overapplied Overhead  

Underapplied overhead is the opposite of overapplied overhead. Overapplied overhead occurs when expenses incurred are actually less than what a company accounts for in its budget. This means that a company comes in under budget and achieves a lower amount of overhead costs during the accounting period.



Businesses must account for overapplied overheads as well. This is recorded in the opposite manner that underapplied overhead is on the balance sheet—first noted as a credit to the overhead section, which is then offset by a credit on the COGS section and debit on the overhead section by the end of the fiscal year.
What Does Underbanked Mean?  

Underbanked refers to individuals or families who have a bank account but often rely on alternative financial services such as money orders, check-cashing services, and payday loans rather than on traditional loans and credit cards to manage their finances and fund purchases. This may be because they lack access to convenient, affordable banking services or because they need or prefer to use alternatives to traditional financial services.





Key Takeaways

Underbanked households often rely on cash and alternative financial services, as opposed to credit cards and traditional loans, to fund purchases and manage their finances.Many underbanked households lack access to affordable banking and financial services.According to the Federal Reserve, 13% of U.S. adults are underbanked.


   Understanding the Underbanked  

The majority of people use banks to conduct routine financial transactions. Banks offer public checking accounts for everyday use to make deposits, withdrawals and transfers, and to pay bills. Savings accounts and other investment vehicles offer consumers a place to store their money and earn interest. Banks also offer consumers a variety of credit facilities such as loans and mortgages.



People who have a bank account but also tap into alternative financial services, such as short-term payday loans, check-cashing services, and prepaid debit cards, are typically referred to as the underbanked. Some households are considered unbanked because they don't use banks or financial services at all.


   How Many People Are Underbanked in the U.S.?  

According to a 2021 Federal Reserve (FRB) report on the economic well-being of U.S. households, in 2020, 13% of adults in the U.S. were underbanked, while 5% were unbanked. Those results marked an improvement on 2018 when the FRB found that 16% of U.S. adults were underbanked and 6% were unbanked.



The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) runs its own survey on how households use banking services. The FDIC revealed that an estimated 5.4% of U.S. households were unbanked in 2019, meaning that 94.6% of U.S. households had at least a checking or savings account.



In its 2019 report, the FDIC broke down the financial services activities of the population but, unlike in previous years, stopped short of providing a specific percentage figure of underbanked households. In 2017, the government agency put its estimate of underbanked at 48.9 million adults, or 18.7% of U.S. households, down from 19.9% in 2015.






The FRB and the FDIC's numbers cannot be directly compared as they define the underbanked somewhat differently.


   Who Are the Underbanked?  

The FRB has stated that both the unbanked and underbanked "are more likely to have low income, less education, or be in a racial or ethnic minority group." Among the underbanked, 21% had a family income of under $25,000 (vs. 5% with incomes over $100,000) and 24% didn't have a high school degree (vs. 8% with a bachelor's degree or more). In terms of race/ethnicity, 27% of Blacks and 21% of Latinx were underbanked vs. 9% of Whites.







When it comes to applying for credit, the FRB survey showed that Americans with incomes under $50,000 per year were much more likely to be denied traditional bank credit than those with incomes over $100,000 (39% vs. 9%, respectively). In every income bracket, Black and Latinx individuals were more likely to experience an adverse credit outcome than White applicants.






Community development financial institutions (CDFIs) provide loans to home buyers and businesses in rural, impoverished, and disadvantaged communities.







The FDIC study came to similar conclusions regarding links between the underbanked and lower-income, lower education levels, and less access to credit. It also explored bill payment methods, finding that 11.9% of households used money orders, 5.5% used cashier’s checks, and 4.9% used bill payment services, such as those offered by Western Union and MoneyGram, to pay their bills.






Both the FRB and the FDIC have found over the years that households with less predictable and more volatile income were more likely to be underbanked than those with a steady paycheck.




What Is an Underbanked Customer?
An underbanked customer is someone who has a bank account but often relies on alternative sources, such as money orders, check-cashing services, and payday loans, to manage finances.




What Is the Difference Between Unbanked and Underbanked?
Underbanked households have a bank account but regularly use alternative financial services. Unbanked households, on the other hand, do not even have a checking or savings account.




Why Are So Many People Underbanked?
There are lots of possible explanations. An obvious one is that traditional financial services are not always accessible to everyone. For example, banks may have deposit minimums or fees that are a barrier. Or they may have stringent loan criteria, whereas payday loan operators are generally more lenient. Moreover, banks may not advertise their services much, or at least not as aggressively as alternative sources do.
What Is Undercapitalization?  

Undercapitalization occurs when a company does not have sufficient capital to conduct normal business operations and pay creditors. This can occur when the company is not generating enough cash flow or is unable to access forms of financing such as debt or equity.



Undercapitalized companies also tend to choose high-cost sources of capital, such as short-term credit, over lower-cost forms such as equity or long-term debt. Investors want to proceed with caution if a company is undercapitalized because the chance of bankruptcy increases when a company loses the ability to service its debts.


   How Undercapitalization Works  

Being undercapitalized is a trait most often found in young companies that do not adequately anticipate the initial costs associated with getting a business up and running. Being undercapitalized can lead to a significant drag on growth, as the company may not have the resources required for expansion, leading to the eventual failure of the company. Undercapitalization can also occur in large companies that take on significant amounts of debt and suffer from poor operating conditions.





Key Takeaways

Undercapitalized companies do not have enough capital to pay creditors and often need to borrow more money.Young companies that do not fully understand initial costs are sometimes undercapitalized.When starting, entrepreneurs must asset their financial needs and expenses—then err on the high side.If a company can't generate capital over time, chances of going bankrupt increase, as it loses the ability to service its debts.



If undercapitalization is caught early enough, and if a company has sufficient cash flows, it can replenish its coffers by selling shares, issuing debt, or obtaining a long-term revolving credit arrangement with a lender. However, if a company is unable to produce net positive cash flow or access any forms of financing, it is likely to go bankrupt.



Undercapitalization can have a number of causes, such as:



Poor macroeconomic conditions that can lead to difficulty in raising funds at critical times
Failure to obtain a line of credit
Funding growth with short-term capital rather than permanent capital
Poor risk management, such as being uninsured or underinsured against predictable business risks


   Examples of Undercapitalization in Small Business  

When starting a business, entrepreneurs should conduct an assessment of their financial needs and expenses—and err on the high side. Common expenses for a new business include rent and utilities, salaries or wages, equipment and fixtures, licenses, inventory, advertising, and insurance, among others. Since startup costs can be a significant hurdle, undercapitalization is a common issue for young companies.



Because of this, small business startups should create a monthly cash flow projection for their first year of operation (at least) and balance it with projected costs. Between the equity, the entrepreneur contributes and the money they are able to raise from outside investors, the business should be able to be sufficiently capitalized.



In some cases, an undercapitalized corporation can leave an entrepreneur liable for business-related matters. This is more likely when corporate and personal assets are commingled when the corporation's owners defraud creditors, and when adequate records are not kept.
What Is Undercast?  

Undercast is a type of forecasting error that occurs when estimates turn out to be below realized values. These estimates could apply to sales, an expense line item, net income, cash flow, or any other financial account.





Key Takeaways

Undercast refers to a forecasting error when estimated numbers turn out to be lower than realized numbers.The estimates that are valued can include sales, expenses, income, cash flows, or any other financial account or metric.Undercast estimates can occur because of a conservative management team or a volatile or unpredictable market.Dishonest undercast estimates can occur because management purposefully lowered estimates to ensure that the actual performance would outperform the lower numbers.Continuous undercasting indicates that a company is ineffectively deploying its resources based on poor estimates.


   Understanding Undercast  

Companies try to predict their financial performance for the upcoming year. They typically use forecasting models based on a variety of inputs, including the economic environment, past performance, and any changes in legislation that could impact the business.



Forecasts and budgets help a company determine how to best allocate resources, confirm areas in the company that are working efficiently, and highlight areas that need correction in the business process. When a company in the private sector, government agency, or nonprofit organization prepares its budget for the upcoming year, it relies on its best and most up-to-date information to estimate what the operational numbers will look like for the next 12 months.



Typically, the two main areas that a business aims to estimate are its revenues and its expenses. This will indicate what it expects its profits to be for the upcoming year. Managers of businesses pull together all relevant information and make assumptions. Sometimes these assumptions are subject to greater degrees of uncertainty, which may ultimately cause an undercast or overcast.



When a company's actual results fall short of what was expected, they have undercast that specific account. An undercast situation is akin to budgetary slack, and if undercasting occurs frequently, the causes should be investigated.



Undercasting could be a reflection of a cautious or conservative management team, particularly if its market or the general economy is in a state of flux. Continuous undercasting is a problem for a company as it means it does not strongly understand the business environment or its operational processes and is ineffectively deploying its resources based on poor estimates.



It should also be determined if undercast estimates are a result of compensation motives. For example, if the bonuses paid to managers are linked to how well they outperform the budget estimates, they may purposely undercast the budget, thereby ensuring that the actual results are better than the estimates.


   Examples of Undercast  

A steel manufacturer forecasts $3 billion in sales for the year. However, due to the imposition of tariffs to protect the domestic industry from foreign imports, which increases domestic sales, the company realized $3.5 billion in sales. The undercast amount of $500 million was due to an unforeseen change in legislation that helped the business.



As another example, the management team of a technology firm estimates that profits will be $50 million. However, they also know that their bonuses will be tied to beating the estimated profit number. Therefore, in reporting its profit estimates, the management team reports $35 million, ensuring that the actual profits will beat the reported estimate. This $15 million undercast was done on purpose, in a dishonest way, so that management could secure their bonus that is tied to performance.
What Is Underconsumption?  

Underconsumption is the purchase of goods and services at levels that fall below the available supply.





Key Takeaways

Underconsumption deems inadequate consumer demand to be the only source of recessions, stagnation, and other aggregate demand failures.According to the theory of underconsumption, a capitalist economy invariably tends toward a state of persistent depression.Other modern economic theories find that inadequate consumer demand alone does not automatically cause a recession because other factors may counteract this situation.


   Understanding Underconsumption  

Underconsumption is an economic theory referring to recession and stagnation. In this theory, inadequate consumer demand in relation to the production of a particular good or service results in underconsumption.



Underconsumption theories date back hundreds of years and have been largely replaced by modern Keynesian economics and the theory of aggregate demand, which is the total demand for goods and services in the economy at a particular time and price level.


   Underconsumption vs. Keynesian Theory  

Underconsumption asserts that consumption of less than is produced is caused by insufficient purchasing power and results in business depression. Furthermore, the theory of underconsumption claims that because workers are paid a wage lower than they produce, they cannot buy back what they produce, therefore resulting in an inadequate demand for the product. This can be rectified by government intervention, specifically spending on public programs, to restore the balance between production and consumption.



The Keynesian theory addresses total spending in the economy and its effects on output and inflation, and it was developed by the British economist John Maynard Keynes during the 1930s in an attempt to understand the Great Depression. Keynes advocated increased government expenditures and lower taxes to stimulate demand and pull the global economy out of the depression. Keynesian economics is considered a "demand-side" theory that focuses on changes in the economy over the short run.



The theory of underconsumption deems inadequate consumer demand to be the only source of recessions, stagnation, and other aggregate demand failures, and therefore a capitalist economy tends toward a state of persistent depression because of this. In contrast, modern economic theories find that inadequate consumer demand does not automatically cause a recession because other factors, including private fixed investments in factories, machines and housing, and government purchases and exports may counteract this situation.


   Example of Underconsumption  

An example of underconsumption is the automobile industry during the Great Depression. During the 1920s, increases in disposable income and the new affordability of automobiles resulted in more people purchasing cars. Increased demand led to the creation of a large number of independent auto dealers and manufacturers.



When the stock market crashed and the effects of the Great Depression took hold, many Americans became unemployed and encountered financial troubles, resulting in less purchasing power for cars in relation to the supply. Due to the plummeting demand for automobiles, many independent manufacturers were not able to stay in business.
Underemployment is a measure of the total number of people in an economy who are unwillingly working in low-skill and low-paying jobs or only part-time because they cannot get full-time jobs that use their skills.



Underemployment as well as unemployment is counted in U.S. government reports in order to provide a truer picture of the health of the job market.





Key Takeaways

Underemployment is a measure of employment and labor utilization in the economy that looks at how well the labor force is being used in terms of skills, experience, and availability to work.It refers to a situation in which individuals are forced to work in low-paying or low-skill jobs.Visible underemployment and invisible underemployment are types of underemployment.Underemployment can be caused by a variety of factors, from economic recessions to business cycles.The unemployment rate is calculated based solely on the labor force, which does not include persons who are not seeking a job.


   Understanding Underemployment  

Underemployment is calculated by dividing the number of underemployed individuals by the total number of workers in a labor force.



There are two types of underemployment: Visible underemployment is underemployment in which an individual works fewer hours than is necessary for a full-time job in their chosen field. Due to the reduced hours, they may work two or more part-time jobs in order to make ends meet.



The second type of underemployment is invisible underemployment. It refers to the employment situation in which an individual is unable to find a job in their chosen field. Consequently, they work in a job that is not commensurate with their skill set and, in most cases, pays much below their customary wage.



A third type of underemployment refers to situations in which individuals who are unable to find work in their chosen field quit the workforce altogether, meaning they haven't looked for a job in the last four weeks, per the Bureau of Labor Statistics' (BLS) definition of "not in the labor force."



The number of these workers skyrocketed during the onset of the economic crisis and lockdown in early 2020, which ultimately resulted in a substantial change in working conditions and coincided with a crash in the markets. It is statistically difficult to measure the third type of underemployment.


   Causes of Underemployment  

Underemployment can be caused due to several factors. The period during and after a recession, when companies downsize and lay off qualified workers, is characterized by underemployment. Underemployment jumped to its highest levels in the recession resulting from the global outbreak crisis.



According to a BLS report, the number of underemployed individuals in the U.S. economy decreased from 9 million during the fourth quarter of 2018 to 8.2 million in the same period a year later. On an overall basis, the agency estimated that there were 95 million people not in the labor force (including discouraged workers who had stopped looking for work) in Q4'19.



Another cause of underemployment is changes in the job market due to shifts in technology. As job descriptions change or jobs are automated, laid-off workers can be retrained or retired from the workforce. Those who do not have the resources or means to retrain themselves are generally susceptible to underemployment.


   Weaknesses of the Unemployment Rate  

The unemployment rate counts those workers who are part of the labor force and actively seeking work but are currently without it. The unemployment rate receives the majority of the national spotlight, but that can be misleading as the main indicator of the job market's health, since it does not account for the full potential of the labor force.



The U.S. unemployment rate was 13.3% as of May 2020, but at the same time, the U.S. underemployment rate was 22.8%. The unemployment rate is defined by the BLS as including "as a percentage of the labor force (the labor force is the sum of the employed and unemployed)." A measure of underemployment is needed to express the opportunity cost of advanced skills not being used or being underutilized.



What's more, the unemployment rate is calculated based solely on the labor force, which does not include persons who are not seeking a job. There are many instances in which a person is able to work but has become too discouraged with an unsuccessful job hunt to continue to actively seek a job. The labor force participation rate is used to measure the percentage of the civilian population over the age of 16 who is working or seeking work.



The BLS compiles six different unemployment rates labeled U-1 through U-6. U-3 is the officially recognized unemployment rate, but U-6 is a better representation of the job market as it accounts for discouraged workers who have left the labor force, workers who are not utilizing their full skill set, and workers who have part-time employment but would rather be employed full time.


   Example of Underemployment  

For example, an individual with an engineering degree working as a pizza delivery man as his main source of income is considered to be underemployed. Also, an individual who is working part-time at an office job but would prefer to instead work full-time is considered underemployed. In both cases, these individuals are underutilized by the economy as they, in theory, can provide a greater benefit to the overall economy.
What Is Underemployment Equilibrium?  

Underemployment equilibrium, also referred to as under-employment equilibrium or below full employment equilibrium, is a condition where employment in an economy persists below full employment and the economy has entered an equilibrium state that sustains a rate of unemployment above what is considered desirable. In this state the unemployment rate remains consistently above the natural rate of unemployment or non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment (NAIRU) because aggregate supply and aggregate demand are in balance at a point below full potential output. An economy that settles into an underemployment equilibrium is how Keynesian theory explains the occurrence of a persistent depression in an economy.



The term "underemployment" in this sense simply refers to the fact that total employment is under the level of full employment. Underemployment itself is a distinct term that refers to employed workers who are working fewer hours than they would like or in jobs that require lower skills (and often come with lower pay) than their education level and experience would indicate. Underemployment may be included as one component of the general unemployment rate, but is otherwise unrelated to the concept of an underemployment equilibrium, though these two uses are often mistakenly conflated by those unfamiliar with economics.





Key Takeaways

Underemployment equilibrium describes a state in an economy where unemployment is persistently higher than usual.In this state, the economy has reached a point of macroeconomic equilibrium somewhere below full potential output, which results in sustained unemployment.Underemployment equilibrium is a classic part of the Keynesian theory of how recession can lead to persistent depression in an economy.Underemployment by itself is a distinct term that refers to one possible component of unemployment but is otherwise unrelated to the idea of an underemployment equilibrium.


   Understanding Underemployment Equilibrium  

An economy in long-run equilibrium is one that is said to be experiencing full employment. When an economy is below full employment, it is not producing what it would have were it in full employment. This state of underemployment means that there is a gap between actual and potential output in the economy.



In Keynesian macroeconomic theory, when an economy, for whatever reason, falls into a  recession from a state of full employment, it can then get stuck in a persistent situation where it finds a new balance between aggregate supply and aggregate demand with a lower total volume of output. The original Keynesian explanation for this revolved around the idea that uncertainty and fear in the wake of a recession could induce businesses and investors to reduce their level of investment in favor of holding cash or other liquid assets more or less permanently.



This reduction in investment would lead to both a reduction in aggregate demand from reduced investment spending on capital goods and a reduction in aggregate supply as the level of employment and general output fell. As a result, the economy would not bounce back and recover from a temporary recession, but could settle into a steady state of elevated unemployment as aggregate demand and aggregate supply reached a new equilibrium at a lower level of output and employment.



This theory is in contrast to others, such as Walrasian general equilibrium, which suggest that through the adjustment of prices and the actions of entrepreneurs pursuing opportunities, the economy will adjust back toward equilibrium at full employment (minus some natural rate of unemployment) once the the recession and its associated negative real and financial shocks have passed. Keynes disputed these theories, and later Keynesian economists came up with further explanations as to why markets might not adjust back toward full employment after a recession, such as the idea of price stickiness. Advocates of Keynesian economics suggest that a solution to an underemployment equilibrium state is a fiscal policy of deficit spending and, to a lesser extent, monetary policy to stimulate the economy.


   Underemployment vs Underemployment Equilibrium  

The term "underemployment" refers to a type of labor under-utilization where a worker is employed, but not producing at their full potential or working as much as they would like to. Underemployed workers may be working in part-time jobs when they would prefer to work full time or may be working in low-skilled, low-productivity jobs while they posses more advanced skills, educational credentials, or experience.



Broad measures of unemployment reported by government statistical agencies may account for underemployment in addition to joblessness. Underemployment may have many of the same causes as unemployment, but often also results from an oversupply of higher education relative to job opportunities or a mismatch of skills and education to available jobs. Beyond its contribution to the total rate of labor under-utilization, however, underemployment itself is not related to the concept of an underemployment equilibrium and the two terms should not be confused with each other.
What Is an Underfunded Pension Plan?  

An underfunded pension plan is a company-sponsored retirement plan that has more liabilities than assets. In other words, the money needed to cover current and future retirements is not readily available. This means there is no assurance that future retirees will receive the pensions they were promised or that current retirees will continue to get their previously established distribution amount. An underfunded pension may be contrasted with a fully-funded or overfunded pension.





Key Takeaways

Underfunded pension plans do not have enough money on hand to cover their current and future commitments.This is risky for a company as pension guarantees to former and current employees are often binding.Underfunding is often caused by investment losses or poor planning.The opposite of an underfunded pension plan is an overfunded pension plan; one that has a surplus of assets to meet its obligations.


   Understanding an Underfunded Pension Plan  

A defined-benefit pension plan comes with a guarantee that the promised payments will be received during the employee's retirement years. The company invests its pension fund in various assets in order to generate enough income to service the liabilities posed by those guarantees for both current and future retirees.



The funded status of a pension plan describes how its assets versus its liabilities stack up. "Underfunded" means that the liabilities, or the obligations to pay pensions, exceed the assets that have accumulated to fund those payments.



Pensions can be underfunded for a number of reasons. Interest rate changes and stock market losses can greatly reduce the fund's assets. During an economic slowdown, pension plans are susceptible to becoming underfunded.


   Funding a Pension  

Under current IRS and accounting rules, pensions can be funded through cash contributions and by company stock, but the amount of stock that can be contributed is limited to a percentage of the total portfolio.



Companies generally contribute as much stock as they can in order to minimize their cash contributions; however, this practice is not sound portfolio management because it results in an overinvestment in the employer's stock. The fund becomes overly dependent on the financial health of the employer.






An underfunded pension plan should not be confused with an unfunded pension plan. The latter is a pay-as-you-go plan that uses the employer's current income to fund pension payments.



A plan is considered at risk for a plan year if the "funding target attainment percentage for the preceding plan year is less than 80% and for the preceding year is 70%.



The need to make this cash payment could materially reduce the company's earnings per share, and therefore its stock price. The reduction in company equity could even trigger defaults on corporate loan agreements. This has serious consequences ranging from higher interest rate requirements to bankruptcy.


   Determining If a Pension Plan Is Underfunded  

Figuring out whether a company has an underfunded pension plan can be as simple as comparing the fair value of plan assets to the accumulated benefit obligation, which includes the current and future amounts owed to retirees. If the fair value of the plan assets is less than the benefit obligation, there is a pension shortfall.



The company is required to disclose this information in a footnote in the company's 10-K annual financial statement. 



There is a risk that companies will use overly-optimistic assumptions in estimating their future obligations. Assumptions are necessary when estimating long-term obligations. A company may revise its assumptions as time goes on to minimize a shortfall and avoid the need to contribute additional money to the fund.



For example, a company could assume a long-term rate of return of 9.5%, which would increase the funds expected to come from investments and reduce the need for a cash infusion. In real life, the long-term return on stocks is about 7% and the return on bonds is even lower.


   Underfunded vs. Overfunded Pensions  

The opposite of an underfunded pension is, of course, an overfunded pension. A fund that has more assets than liabilities is overfunded.



Actuaries calculate the amount of contributions a company must pay into a pension based on the benefits participants receive or are promised and the estimated growth of the plan’s investments. These contributions are tax-deductible to the employer.



How much money the plan ends up with at the end of the year depends on the amount they paid out to participants and the investment growth they earned on the money. As such, shifts in the market can cause a fund to be either underfunded or overfunded.



It is common for defined-benefit plans to become overfunded in the hundreds of thousands or even millions of dollars. An overfunded pension plan will not result in increased participant benefits and cannot be used by the business or its owners.




What Happens When a Defined-Benefit Plan Is Underfunded?
When a defined benefit plan is underfunded, it means that it does not have enough assets to meet its payout obligations to employees. If a plan is underfunded, then it must increase its contributions to be able to meet these obligations. A plan may allow for employees to increase their contributions or a plan may decide to reduce the payout for employees. This is usually the case if a plan is significantly underfunded rather than slightly underfunded; the latter of which may be due to temporary adverse market movements.




What Happens When a Defined-Benefit Plan Is Overfunded?
When a defined benefit plan is overfunded, it means that the plan has more assets than it needs to meet its payout obligations to employees. The surplus can be considered as net income, but cannot be paid out to shareholders.




Can I Withdraw Money From a Defined-Benefit Plan?
Generally, no, you cannot withdraw money from a defined-benefit plan before the allowed legal age, this includes hardship withdrawals. Furthermore, this is not allowed if a plan is underfunded. People can, however, take loans against their defined-benefit plan.
What Is the Underground Economy?  

The underground economy refers to economic transactions that are deemed illegal, either because the goods or services traded are unlawful in nature, or because transactions fail to comply with governmental reporting requirements. The underground economy is called the shadow economy, the black market, or the informal economy.





Key Takeaways

While estimates vary, some put the underground economy at 11% to 12% of U.S. gross domestic product (GDP), or roughly $2.25 trillion to $2.5 trillion. Elements of the underground economy vary from nation to nation, state to state, and in some cases, municipality to municipality.Alternative names for the underground economy include the shadow economy, the black market, and the informal economy.Dealing in illegal drugs, human trafficking, endangered species, human organs, antiquities, and stolen goods are examples of activities in the underground economy.


   Understanding the Underground Economy  

It is difficult to accurately gauge the size of underground economies because, by nature, they're not subject to governmental oversight; therefore, the economic activity does not generate tax returns or appear in official statistical reports; however, tracking outgoing expenditures, even though the transactions are cloaked, can give a sense of statistics. In other words, the money spent—that's not accounted for in recorded transactions—theoretically represents the breadth of black market activity.



The American underground economy was estimated to have reached $1 trillion in 2009, representing approximately 8% of U.S. gross domestic product (GDP); however, by 2013, largely due to the long-term effects of the 2008 financial crisis and the resulting contraction of the formal economy, underground economic expenditures reached an estimated $2 trillion. Estimates vary, but studies show that the U.S. underground economy is 11% to 12% of GDP, making the underground economy approximately $2.5 trillion in 2021.


   Global Underground Economies  

Compared to most other nations, America's underground economy has stayed relatively flat, according to findings published by a 2018 International Monetary Fund study, which explored the shadow economic activity of 158 countries between 1991 to 2015. Some of the chief takeaways of the report are as follows:



The mean value of the size of the shadow economy across all nations was 31.9%.The nations with the three largest shadow economies were Zimbabwe (60.6%), Bolivia (62.3%), and Georgia (64.9%).The three smallest shadow economies were Austria (8.9%), the United States (8.3%), and Switzerland (7.2%).



Depending on the context, the impact of underground economies can range from harmful to helpful. For example, in developing countries with large shadow economies, the uncollected tax revenue can slow economic growth and hamper the creation of public programs; however, in other cases, participants in underground economies who retain income that would usually go to taxes can boost overall economic activity and stimulate demand.



This situation holds especially true in nations where the withheld tax revenues would have been siphoned off by corrupt government officials.


   What Is Considered "Underground"?  

The list of activities deemed to be underground economic transactions varies, depending on the laws of a given jurisdiction. For example, in some countries, alcohol is banned, while other nations encourage legal brewery, distillery, and distribution operations. Similarly, while drugs are illegal in most countries, some nations, plus an increasing number of U.S. states, have legalized the sale and use of cannabis.



In the early 1900s, Mexican immigrants introduced recreational marijuana use to the United States. During the Great Depression, high unemployment rates triggered fears of marijuana consumption, which (coupled with racist sentiments at the time) led to research that linked marijuana to violent crime.



Consequently, by 1931, 29 U.S. states outlawed the drug. Nonetheless, many people deemed the plant to be harmless and continued buying and selling it illegally. Subsequent studies refuted the idea that marijuana was linked to crime while declaring that the drug was neither addictive nor a gateway to other drugs. Instead, proponents argue, marijuana has proven to be therapeutically helpful in treating illnesses such as cancer and AIDS.



As of 2022, 37 states and the District of Columbia have legalized the plant for medical use, which is now abundantly present in some food products, as well as many topical and oral medications. As of 2022, 18 states and D.C. allow for non-medical regulated cannabis.






The IRS considers money earned from babysitting as taxable self-employment income and, when the amount is greater than $400 for the year (as of 2022), must be reported when the individual files their tax return.



Meanwhile, an estimated 53.2% of cigarette sales in New York state in 2018 (latest figures) were facilitated through underground economic transactions. Although tobacco is legal in New York City, the product carries an exorbitant sin tax, and so many sales go unreported or "under-the-table."



All such under-the-table transactions, in which participants fail to report their income to the IRS or the state, are technically considered to be underground economic activities. This status can even apply to babysitters who don't report the cash that they pocket after watching a neighbor's child down the street.



Other primary examples of underground economic activity include the untaxed sale of physical goods and the smuggling of goods into a country to avoid paying duties at the border. Human trafficking operations also comprise the underground economy, as do the markets for copyrighted materials, endangered animal species, antiquities, and illegally-harvested human organs.




Which Country Has the Largest Underground Economy?
Zimbabwe has the largest underground economy with approximately 60.6% of its economy made up of underground activities. Switzerland has the smallest underground economy, making up 7.2% of its economy.




What Are the Characteristics of an Underground Economy?
Underground economies do not just include illegal activities, such as the purchase and sale of banned drugs or the illegal sale of weapons. It also includes any unreported income, such as paying restaurant employees under the table or jobs such as babysitting that go unreported. Similarly, any bartering that does not involve the exchange of cash and is not reported is considered part of the underground economy.




Why Do People Engage in the Underground Economy?
There are a variety of reasons why people engage in the underground economy. These reasons can be as simple as obtaining items that they can not legally buy, such as outlawed drugs and weapons. It can also be to avoid taxes, labor laws, and administrative paperwork.
What Is Underinsurance?  

Underinsurance refers to an insufficient insurance policy. A good insurance policy won’t prevent any of life’s calamities, but it should make the financial consequences easier to bear. However, underinsurance can leave the enrollee liable for a large financial expense if a serious event occurs. Whether it’s a home damaged by a hurricane or fire, or an insured person experiencing a serious disease or accident, insurance should ideally cover enough of the expense that the policyholder can manage the difference.





Key Takeaways:

Underinsurance is insufficient insurance coverage that leaves the policyholder responsible for a large percentage of a total loss or expense and may lead to financial hardship.If a homeowner is underinsured and the residence suffers significant damage, then the insurance payout may not be enough to cover repairs or replacement.Similarly, inadequate health insurance coverage can lead to medical debt and even bankruptcy if a serious illness or accident occurs.Rates for homeowners insurance are rising. Shopping around for competitive bids may save you money.It’s important to set aside money to meet health insurance deductibles and co-pays so that needed care isn’t delayed for financial reasons.


   What Happens When You’re Underinsured  

You can be underinsured if your policy has gaps or exclusions that leave you without coverage. Or it could be that your claim exceeds the maximum amount that the insurance policy can pay out. A lower-benefits policy may seem attractive because you pay lower monthly insurance premiums. But if the policy leaves you underinsured, then the loss arising from a claim may far exceed any marginal savings in insurance premiums.



Underinsurance can cause a serious financial crisis, depending on the asset that is insured and the extent of the shortfall in insurance.






Inflation, extreme weather events, and an increase in people’s risk consciousness due to the COVID-19 pandemic will trigger above-average insurance premium growth in 2022, according to global insurance provider Swiss Re Group.


   Underinsurance and Residential Insurance  

Insurance costs for home and rental properties are on the upswing. From 2017 to 2021, premiums reportedly rose an average of 12.2% nationwide. Lots of natural catastrophes, coupled with more people moving into disaster-prone regions and rising home repair and rebuilding costs, are considered the main drivers of this rise in insurance costs.

The average annual homeowners insurance premium in 2021



Underinsurance for your home can cause a serious financial crisis, depending on the amount of damage and the extent of the shortfall in insurance. Take, for example, a house and its contents that are insured against all risks for $250,000 with a deductible of $20,000. The house is subsequently destroyed in a fire, and the cost to replace the residence and its contents comes to $350,000. That will require the homeowners to make up the difference of $100,000—plus the $20,000 deductible—from their own resources.


  How to Avoid Residential Underinsurance  

If you experience a sharp rate increase, shop around. You may be able to find a less expensive option that still provides ample coverage.If you want to stay with your current insurer, ask for a quote for a policy with a higher deductible that maintains good coverage. A higher deductible should mean lower premiums and may be worth it if the reduction is significant.Check the policy’s exclusions. Damage from earthquakes and floods, for example, is usually not included.






If you can’t purchase a policy because you live in a high-risk area, consider buying one through a Fair Access to Insurance Requirements (FAIR) program, available in many states.


   Underinsurance and Health Insurance  

The percentage of U.S. adults with no health insurance decreased from 20% in 2010 to an estimated 13% in 2020, thanks mainly to the Affordable Care Act (ACA), or Obamacare. However, the percentage of adults who are underinsured increased from 16% in 2010 to 21% in 2020.



When individuals and families are underinsured, they may have to take on debt to pay deductibles and medical bills. They may postpone needed care—avoiding seeing a doctor when they’re sick, skipping a test or treatment recommended by a doctor, not seeing a specialist, or not filling a prescription because of the cost.



A person is considered underinsured if their out-of-pocket healthcare expenses are equal to or exceed 10% of their annual income (5% is they are considered low-income), or if their health plan deductible is more than 5% of their annual income, according to The Commonwealth Fund. Roughly one-quarter of Americans with employer-sponsored health insurance were underinsured in 2020.



Choosing a health insurance plan often involves striking a balance between lower monthly premium levels (which often mean higher deductibles and higher co-pays) and more comprehensive coverage. This applies to choices in healthcare plans offered by an employer, plans selected at HealthCare.gov and Medicaid.gov, Medicare Supplement (Medigap) policies, and Medicare Part D prescription drug coverage.



In a lower-premium bronze plan at HealthCare.gov, for example, you are responsible for 40% of your covered healthcare costs, and the insurer pays about 60%. In the highest-premium platinum plans, you pay 10% and the insurer pays 90% of your covered healthcare costs.


  Short-Term Health Plans and Underinsurance  

Short-term health plans were traditionally marketed to people who experience temporary gaps in coverage. These plans are less costly than the lowest level plans at HealthCare.gov and can deny or restrict coverage for preexisting conditions. In 2017, the Trump administration changed the regulations so that anyone can sign up for a short-term plan and expanded the length of time that these plans could be renewed.



Short-term health plans are not required to cover the package of 10 essential health benefits found in the ACA. Many of these plans don’t cover maternity care or, in many cases, substance abuse treatment, outpatient prescription drugs, or mental health services.



People in short-term healthcare plans are more likely to have coverage gaps. When services are covered, cost sharing may be very high. For example, a May 2020 study by The Commonwealth Fund calculated out-of-pocket costs for COVID-19 patients who had short-term plans in Georgia, Louisiana, and Ohio. For patients with a moderate case of the virus, patient costs ranged from $14,600 to $17,750. For a severe case of COVID, patient costs ranged from $28,600 to $35,000.


  How to Avoid Health Underinsurance  

Set money aside to meet deductibles and co-pays so that economic considerations won’t keep you from seeking needed care. And make sure the plan has a high upper limit so that you are covered for unexpected emergencies.
If you are in good health and have received medical care regularly, you may be able to save money by choosing a low-premium, high-deductible plan.
If you have a chronic health condition or have not had regular medical care, it’s best to opt for a plan with higher coverage.
When choosing among employer-based health insurance plans, be aware that some may leave you underinsured. Look for the most comprehensive plan you can afford.
If possible, avoid short-term health insurance plans, as they can leave you underinsured. They are not mandated to cover all essential health services and may have high deductibles and cost sharing.




What is meant by underinsurance?
Underinsurance basically refers to a person having insurance coverage but with a policy that won’t pay out enough to cover the full expenses incurred when filing a claim. For example, if Roy has his house insured for $200,000, but the cost to repair it in the event of a bout of bad weather would be at least $300,000, then he is underinsured—in this case, by $100,000.




How many Americans are underinsured?
According to The Commonwealth Fund, 21% of U.S. adults had inadequate health insurance coverage in 2020.




Who is most likely to be underinsured?
People most likely to be underinsured include those struggling to make ends meet and those without a decent understanding of how these products work. Insurance, though a relatively simple concept, is often wrapped in complex jargon and pages of fine print. If not properly read and understood, this could lead to big discrepancies between what is expected and what is actually offered.
What Is Underinsured Motorist Coverage?  

Underinsured motorist coverage is an addition to your auto insurance policy. It protects you if you're in an accident involving someone who doesn't have sufficient insurance of their own. In an accident, the insurance of the at-fault person is supposed to compensate the other injured person. If the at-fault party's policy has a limit below the cost of the damages, the injured party's underinsured motorist coverage would cover the rest.



Underinsured coverage is not the same as uninsured coverage, which covers cases in which the at-fault driver has no insurance at all, though the two types may be bundled together. A handful of states require underinsured motorist coverage, while more require uninsured motorist coverage.





Key Takeaways

Underinsured motorist coverage provides protection in case of an accident in which the at-fault driver doesn't have enough insurance to cover all damages.This kind of coverage is a relatively inexpensive add-on to a regular auto insurance policy and can prove to be beneficial in the case of an accident.A few states require drivers to have underinsured motorist coverage, while a greater amount requires uninsured motorist coverage.


   Understanding Underinsured Motorist Coverage  

When a person has an accident which is not their fault, and the other motorist does not have enough insurance to cover the damages, underinsured coverage kicks in. Once you file a claim with your provider, it will contact the other driver's insurance for payment. If the other driver did not carry enough insurance to cover your expenses adequately, the underinsured coverage would satisfy, up to the limit of your policy.



For example, assume you have medical and automobile damages totaling $200,000. The other driver has insurance to cover only $100,000. You can claim the balance against your insurance provider, up to the limit of your policy's coverage. You can not request more than the actual costs you had as a direct result of the accident. 



Some insurance providers will have a limit on how long you can wait before you file your underinsured claim. These limits will vary by company and can be as little as 30 days. As the insurance company settles your claim, it will want copies and billings from all medical care received and any automobile repair that resulted from the event. If the insurance provider decides that the costs submitted with the claim are unnecessary—or not related to the accident—it will deny those amounts. If the policyholder disagrees with the decision of the insurance provider, the case will usually go to binding arbitration.






Your ability to sue an uninsured or underinsured driver depends on the laws in your state.


   Benefits of Underinsured Motorist Coverage  

​​​​​​​Underinsured motorist coverage is usually a relatively inexpensive add-on to your auto insurance policy cost, but can prove beneficial if you're in an accident where the driver who was found to be at fault does not have enough insurance to cover the cost of damages from the crash. This happens much more frequently than one might expect: One in every eight U. S. drivers on the road do not have insurance, reports the Insurance Research Council.



Even if someone does have coverage, they may have only purchased the most basic state-required minimum amount, which varies by state. New Hampshire and Virginia are the only U.S. states that do not require a minimum amount of auto insurance coverage. However, all states have financial responsibility laws, so where there is no insurance requrement, there is a legal obligation to prove you can pay for damages if you cause an accident.



Different types of underinsured motorist coverage are available from most insurance providers. Some coverage will include bodily injury and others will be for property damage, while still others will cover both costs.
What Is the Underinsured Motorist Coverage Limits Trigger?  

The underinsured motorist coverage limits trigger is one of the two triggers that can be specified by an insured party to protect against losses caused by an accident with a driver who has insufficient insurance.



The underinsured motorist coverage limits trigger ensures coverage in the event of an accident caused by a driver with inadequate insurance, and when the underinsured driver's liability limit is lower than that of the insured person or policyholder. The other trigger for underinsured motorist coverage is known as the damages or coverage trigger.





Key Takeaways

The underinsured motorist coverage limits trigger ensures insurance coverage for damages caused by an at-fault motorist without adequate auto insurance to fully cover the other injured party's damages.This kind of coverage is a relatively inexpensive add-on to a regular auto insurance policy and can prove to be beneficial in the case of an accident.Underinsured motorist endorsements are mandatory in many states and typically last between six and 12 months.﻿﻿


   Understanding the Underinsured Motorist Coverage Limits Trigger  

Drivers purchase auto insurance for several reasons, such as the risk of their car becoming damaged in an accident, the risk of damaging another person’s car, or the risk of killing or injuring another person. But one risk that is sometimes neglected by drivers is the possibility that they might be injured, or have their car damaged, by another driver who has failed to take out adequate auto insurance.



In that instance, the policyholder might have a legitimate claim against the at-fault driver but be unable to collect damages. After all, if the at-fault driver does not have the necessary assets or insurance, they might simply declare bankruptcy, leaving little or nothing for the victim to collect.



To protect against this risk, drivers can purchase underinsured motorist coverage as part of their auto insurance policy. This supplemental insurance covers property damages, bodily injury to the policyholder, as well as injuries to insured family members or passengers. If a claim needs to be filed, the endorsement can cover the difference between the coverage paid by the at-fault driver’s insurance and the full amount owing.


   Under- vs. Un-insured Motorist Coverage  

Note that underinsured motorist coverage is not the same as uninsured motorist (UM) coverage, which would cover a situation in which the at-fault driver did not have any insurance. However, these two types of coverage are often bundled together. Either separately or together, they are usually a relatively inexpensive add-on to an auto insurance policy but provide beneficial coverage.



In 2015, approximately one out of eight drivers were under-insured, according to the Insurance Research Council, which tracks data on drivers.﻿﻿ In many states being uninsured is illegal. In fact, every state, with the lone exception of New Hampshire, makes it illegal to not carry some form of auto insurance.﻿﻿ Underinsured coverage is better than no coverage at all. 


   Example of Underinsured Motorist Coverage Limits Trigger  

Assume an insured person has underinsured motorist coverage up to $500,000 with a limits trigger. In the event of an accident with an at-fault driver who only has $100,000 of insurance coverage, an insurance claim of $150,000 would result in the policy holder's underinsured motorist coverage kicking in because of the limits trigger.
What Is an Underinsured Motorist Endorsement?  

In the insurance industry, an underinsured motorist endorsement is a type of supplemental insurance commonly purchased as part of an automobile insurance policy. Its purpose is to provide additional coverage to the policyholder in the event of an accident resulting from another driver whose policy does not cover the total costs of the accident.





Key Takeaways

An underinsured motorist endorsement is a type of supplemental auto insurance.It serves to protect drivers from the risk that, if they enter into an accident, the at-fault driver may not have sufficient coverage to pay for their claim.Underinsured motorist endorsements are mandatory in many states and typically last between six and twelve months.


   How Underinsured Motorist Endorsements Work  

Drivers purchase auto insurance for several reasons, such as the risk of their car becoming damaged in an accident, the risk of damaging another person’s car, or the risk of killing or injuring another person. But one risk that is sometimes neglected by drivers is the possibility that they might be injured, or have their car damaged, by another driver who has failed to take out adequate auto insurance.



In that instance, the policyholder might have a legitimate claim against the at-fault driver but be unable to collect damages. After all, if the at-fault driver does not have the necessary assets or insurance, they might simply declare bankruptcy, leaving little or nothing for the victim to collect.



To protect against this risk, drivers can purchase underinsured motorist endorsements as part of their auto insurance policy. This supplemental insurance policy covers property damages, bodily injury to the policyholder, as well as injuries to insured family members or passengers. If a claim needs to be filed, the endorsement can cover the difference between the coverage paid by the at-fault driver’s insurance and the full amount owing.



In a scenario where the at-fault driver has no insurance and no personal assets to pay for the claim, the endorsement would therefore cover the entire amount of the claim, up to the maximum coverage level specified in the policy.



In many states, drivers are required by law to purchase underinsured motorist endorsements, although it is sometimes referred to using different terms. In some cases, this coverage only applies when the at-fault driver has no auto insurance at all, as opposed to covering the gap between their coverage and the claim amount.



Although the precise insurance requirements vary from state to state, they typically last from six to twelve months and are renewable thereafter. As with most insurance policies, the insurance premiums associated with the coverage will vary based on factors such as the policyholder’s age, years of driving history, and history of claims.


   Real-World Example of an Underinsured Motorist Endorsement  

To illustrate, consider a situation where Driver A gets into an accident with Driver B. The at-fault driver in this scenario is Driver A, and the full damages associated with the incident amount to $175,000. Unfortunately, Driver A only has $100,000 of coverage, but thankfully Driver B has an underinsured motorist endorsement.



For this reason, Driver A’s insurance pays $100,000 out of the $175,000 total, whereas Driver B’s insurance pays the remaining balance of $75,000. Because Driver B purchased an underinsured motorist endorsement, he is able to receive the full $175,000 and be made whole.
What Is the Underinvestment Problem?  

The underinvestment problem is an agency problem proposed by financial economists that exists between shareholders and debt holders, in which a leveraged company foregoes valuable investment opportunities because debt holders would capture a portion of the benefits of the project, leaving insufficient returns to the equity shareholders.





Key Takeaways

The underinvestment problem describes a conundrum whereby a company becomes so overleveraged that it can no longer make investments in growth opportunities.Economists recognize this situation as an agency problem that can arise between a firm's debt holders and equity shareholders.Debt overhang, both in terms of corporations and governments, is a form of the underinvestment problem that negatively impacts either shareholders or a nation's citizens.


   The Underinvestment Problem Explained  

Potential conflicts of interest between managers, stockholders, and debtholders influence capital structure, corporate governance activities, and investment policies. These types of agency problems, in turn, can give rise to inefficient managerial decisions and “suboptimal” investments that generally fall under the categories of problems of underinvestment and overinvestment.



The underinvestment problem in corporate finance theory is credited to Stewart C. Myers of the Sloan School at MIT, who in his "Determinants of Corporate Borrowing" article (1977) in the Journal of Financial Economics hypothesized that "a firm with risky debt outstanding, and which acts in its stockholders' interest, will follow a different decision rule than one which can issue risk-free debt or which issues no debt at all."



Myers adds that "the firm financed with risky debt will, in some states of nature, pass up valuable investment opportunities—opportunities which could make a positive net contribution to the market value of the firm."



The underinvestment problem moves into focus when a firm frequently passes up net present value (NPV) projects because the managers, acting on behalf of shareholders, believe that creditors would benefit more than owners. If cash flows from a prospective investment go to creditors, then there would be no incentive to equity holders to proceed with the investment. Such an investment would increase the overall value of the firm, but it does not happen—hence, there is a "problem."


   Contradicting the Modigliani-Miller Theorem  

The underinvestment problem theory is at conflict with the theoretical assumption in the Modigliani-Miller theorem that investment decisions can be made independent of financing decisions. Managers of a leveraged company, Myers argues, do in fact take into consideration the amount of debt that needs to be serviced when evaluating a new investment project.



According to Myers, the value of the firm can be influenced by financing decisions, in contradiction to Modigliani-Miller's central tenet.


   The Underinvestment Problem and Debt Overhang  

One instance of the underinvestment problem is known as a debt overhang. When a firm has a very large level of debt, there comes a point when it can no longer borrow from creditors any longer. The debt burden is so large, in fact, that any and all earnings that come into the company immediately go directly to paying off existing debt instead of going into new investments or projects, limiting the growth of the company. It leads to underinvestment in the firm. As a result, shareholders lose out both to creditors in the present and to future lost growth potential as well.



Debt overhangs also apply to national governments, where the sovereign debt of a nation exceeds its future capacity to repay it. A debt overhang can lead to stagnant growth and the degradation of living standards from underinvestment in critical areas such as healthcare, education, and infrastructure.
What Is Underlying?  

Underlying, when used in equity trading, is the common stock that must be delivered when a warrant is exercised, or when a convertible bond or convertible preferred share is converted to common stock.



The price of the underlying is the main factor that determines the prices of derivative securities, warrants, and convertibles. Therefore, a change in the price of the underlying results in a simultaneous change in the price of the derivative asset linked to it.





Key Takeaways

Underlying refers to the security or asset that must be delivered when a contract or warrant is exercised.In derivatives, the underlying is the security or asset that provides cash flow to a derivative.The underlying of a derivative can be an asset, an index, or even another derivative.For convertible securities, the underlying is the stock that can be exchanged for the note.Underlying assets tend to be less volatile than their derivatives. 


   Understanding Underlying  

Underlying applies to both equities and derivatives. Derivatives contracts are typically structured around the price or value of another asset, such as a stock price. In this case, the stock is the underlying asset of the derivative. When the price of the underlying stock goes up, the market price of the derivative may go up or down as well.



In futures contracts, the underlying is a commodity, such as gold, oil, or wheat. If those commodities markets face a disruption, the futures that use that commodity as an underlying will also be affected.



Convertibles are also structured around an underlying asset, sometimes using derivative-like features. These are debts that may be repaid like bonds, or, under certain conditions, may also be repaid in company shares. Since the value of the shares will affect the value of the convertible, the shares are described as the underlying asset to the convertibles.






While commonly used to refer to assets, an underlying can also be an interest rate, a benchmark, or even another derivative.


   Financial Derivatives  

The term "underlying" appears most often in relation to derivative contracts, which are often structured around another asset. Options trades represent one of the most popular derivatives trades, in which traders make sophisticated bets on the future price of certain stocks or commodities. If the terms of the contract are met, the trader can make a profit.



However, the underlying of a derivative is not always an asset. There are also derivatives whose underlying is a benchmark index, interest rate, or another important financial metric. When this metric rises or falls, the derivatives that use the metric as an underlying see price gains or drops. The underlying can even be another derivative.



Many interest rate swaps use the secured overnight financing rate (SOFR) to exchange cash flows between two entities. When the SOFR benchmark rate rises, the value of the swap changes as well.


   Pros and Cons of Underlying  

When investing in derivatives, it is important to understand the investment characteristics of the underlying asset or index. Each asset bears its own risk profile that also affects the contracts that use it as an underlying. Stocks are affected by investment risk, bonds carry default risk, and other derivatives are affected by market risk.



However, underlying assets tend to be less volatile than their derivatives. The value of a call or put option could fall to zero as it approaches expiration; while stock prices can also swing, they are unlikely to lose value entirely.



When an asset is used as the underlying of a derivative or futures contract, this has the advantage of providing additional liquidity and volume to the market for that asset that might not have been available in the spot market.



For example, when a trader buys or sells an options contract, they are trading an obligation to buy or sell the underlying security. If the option is exercised, someone will have to buy that security, thereby increasing the liquidity of the market.



The main disadvantage is the danger that underlying assets could be adversely affected by speculation in the derivatives markets. During the 2007 housing crisis, real estate prices soared, due in part to speculative trading in mortgage-backed securities and highly complicated derivatives contracts. When the derivative bubbles collapsed, prices of the underlying assets crashed as well.




Advantages and Disadvantages of Underlying

Pros

Derivatives trading provides additional liquidity and volume to underlying spot markets
Underlying assets benefit from having a well-organized and structured trading market.
Underlying assets tend to be less volatile than their derivatives.



Cons

Speculative behavior can adversely affect underlying assets.
Each underlying asset has its own risk profile, that can affect its derivatives.





   Example of Underlying  

Two of the most common types of derivatives are referred to as calls and puts. A call derivative contract gives the owner the right, but not the obligation, to buy a particular stock or asset at a given strike price. If company A is trading at $5 and the strike price is hit at $3, the price of the stock is trending up, the call is theoretically worth $2. In this case, the underlying is the stock priced at $5, and the derivative is the call priced at $2.



A put derivative contract gives the owner the right, but not the obligation, to sell a particular stock at a given strike price. If company A is trading at $5 and the strike price is hit at $7, the price of the stock is trending down, the put is trading $2 in the money and is theoretically worth $2. In this case, the underlying is the stock priced at $5 and the derivative is the put contract priced at $2. Both the call and the put are dependent on price movements in the underlying asset, which in this case is the stock price of company A.




What Happens When the Price of an Underlying Asset Increases?
Price changes to an underlying asset usually cause price changes to their derivatives as well. For example, a call option represents the right to buy a certain stock for a certain price. If the underlying stock is priced $3 higher than the strike price, the option has a price of around $3. If the underlying falls below the strike price at the time of expiration, the option has a value of $0.




Is a Share an Underlying Asset?
Shares can be underlying assets, if a derivative is structured around them. Shares are commonly used as the underlying asset for call and put options, which represent sophisticated bets on the future stock price. Shares can also be underlying for convertible debt, which can be converted to shares if certain conditions are met.




What Are the Primary Underlying Assets?
The most common underlying assets are stocks, commodities, bonds, and currencies. However, there are also derivatives with more abstract underlying values, such as interest and benchmark rates.
What is an Underlying Asset  

Underlying asset are the financial assets upon which a derivative’s price is based. Options are an example of a derivative. A derivative is a financial instrument with a price that is based on a different asset. 


   The Basics of Underlying Asset  

Underlying assets give derivatives their value. For example, an option on stock XYZ gives the holder the right to buy or sell XYZ at the strike price up until expiration. The underlying asset for the option is the stock of XYZ.



An underlying asset can be used to identify the item within the agreement that provides value to the contract. The underlying asset supports the security involved in the agreement, which the parties involved agree to exchange as part of the derivative contract.


   Understanding Derivative Contracts  

The price of an option or futures contract is derived from the price of an underlying asset. In an option contract, the writer must either buy or sell the underlying asset to the buyer on the specified date at the agreed-upon price. The buyer is not obligated to purchase the underlying asset, but they can exercise their right if they choose to do so. If the option is about to expire, and the underlying asset has not moved favorably enough to make exercising the option worthwhile, the buyer can let the expire and they will lose the amount they paid for the option.



Futures are an obligation to the buyer and the seller. The seller of the future agrees to provide the underlying asset at expiry, and the buyer of the contract agrees to buy the underlying at expiry. The price they receive and pay, respectively, is the price they entered the futures contract at. Most futures traders close out their positions prior to expiration since retail traders and hedge funds have little need to take physical possession of barrels of oil, for example. But, they can buy or sell the contract at one price, and if it moves favorably they can exit the trade and make a profit that way. Futures are a derivative because the price of an oil futures contract is based on the price movement of oil, for example.





Key Takeaways

Underlying assets represent the assets from which derivatives derive their value.  Knowing the value of an underlying asset helps traders determine the appropriate action (buy, sell, or hold) with their derivative. 


   Example of an Underlying Asset  

In cases involving stock options, the underlying asset is the stock itself. For example, with a stock option to purchase 100 shares of Company X at a price of $100, the underlying asset is the stock of Company X. The underlying asset is used to determine the value of the option up till expiration. The value of the underlying asset may change before the expiration of the contract, affecting the value of the option. The value of the underlying asset at any given time lets traders know whether the option is worth exercising or not.



The underlying asset could also be a currency or market index, such as the S&P 500. In the case of stock indexes, the underlying asset is comprised of the common stocks within the stock market index.
What is Underlying Debt?  

Underlying debt is a municipal bond term that relates to an implicit understanding that the debt of smaller government entities might have backing from the creditworthiness of larger government entities in the jurisdiction.





Key Takeaways

Underlying debt is a municipal bond term that reflects an implicit understanding that debt of smaller government entities may be backed by the creditworthiness of larger government entities.Underlying debt applies to general obligation municipal bonds.If a smaller entity is having trouble meeting its obligations, the rating of the larger entity carrying the underlying debt can be negatively impacted.


   Understanding Underlying Debt  

On their own, these smaller entities might have a hard time raising funds if they don't have a robust financial position. However, the implicit backing of larger entities facilitates borrowing by smaller entities and allows them to obtain lower interest rates on their obligations. People consider the municipal bonds to be the underlying debt of the backing entity.



The underlying debt situation of smaller municipal debts being implicitly backed by larger governmental entities is quite common in practice. This occurs where smaller entities like cities and school districts offer bonds to the public to finance operations and new initiatives. If a smaller entity is unable to repay its debts, it is unlikely that the city or school district will simply be allowed to become insolvent and cease operations. Rather it is expected that the state will intervene to provide emergency funding to continue debt service and maintain essential services.



Underlying debt applies to general obligation municipal bonds, which are backed by the taxing authority of the issuer or, in the case of underlying debt, the authority of the larger government entity. This sharing of credit responsibilities generally acts as a credit enhancement for the bond issuer. When ratings agencies such as Standard & Poor’s and Moody’s assign an underlying rating for these issuers, the ratings reflect the characteristics of the issuer on a standalone basis.



In addition, the carrying of underlying debt is considered in the rating of larger municipal issuers, specifically their ability to meet all financial obligations, including underlying debt, and to make scheduled interest payments on time. If a smaller entity is having trouble meeting its obligations, the rating of the larger entity carrying the underlying debt can be negatively impacted.


   Examples and Risks of Underlying Debt  

Separate municipalities within a city or country may issue their own debt obligations to finance projects such as hospitals, roads, schools or sanitation facilities. In many cases, the city or county carries these obligations as underlying debt. This is the case in Illinois, where the state relies on the taxing authority of the legislature to back bonds issued by Chicago.



Underlying debt can create additional risks for the larger entity backing the debt as was the case in the state of New York in the 1970s when New York City nearly went insolvent.
What Is an Underlying Mortality Assumption?  

Underlying mortality assumptions are projections of expected death rates used by actuaries to estimate insurance premiums and pension obligations. This is based on mortality tables, which are statistical tables of expected annual mortality rates.



Because of the critical importance of the underlying mortality assumption, actuaries have to follow guidelines set by pension and insurance regulators in deciding on an appropriate assumption, also called the mortality assumption.





Key Takeaways

Underlying mortality assumptions are the modeled projections of expected death rates used by actuaries.They are used to estimate insurance premiums and pension obligations.These assumptions are based on mortality tables, which are statistical tables of expected annual mortality rates.


   Understanding the Underlying Mortality Assumption  

The underlying mortality assumption is a key variable in estimating life expectancies, which in turn determines the cost of insurance for an insurer and the long-term obligations of a pension fund. If the underlying mortality assumption is too low, a life insurer may underestimate the actual cost of insurance and may have to pay out more in death benefit claims than it had forecast.



Conversely, if the underlying mortality assumption is too high, the actuary may underestimate life expectancies of the pension plan members and hence, the long-term obligations of the pension fund.



For most people, death is the last thing they want to think about. For life insurers and pension administrators, it's the first thing they think about. Any good actuary can tell you that people often misjudge the statistics about mortality. They don't understand that mortality at birth and mortality in advanced age are two different things. 


   Special Considerations  

According to the Centers for Disease Control 2020 data, the death rate per 100,000 population is 835.4. Life expectancy at birth was 77 years, and the infant mortality rate was 541.9 deaths per 100,000 live births.



The leading causes of death were.



Heart disease: 168.2 deaths per 100,000 populationCancer: 144.1COVID-19: 85.0Unintentional injuries (accidents): 57.6Stroke: 38.8



For males, life expectancy changed from 76.3 in 2019 to 74.2 in 2020; for females, life expectancy fell from 81.4 to 79.9. The life expectancy for females was consistently higher than it was for males.



Once you make it to advanced age, a new set of statistics comes into play. In 2020, life expectancy at age 65 for the total population was 18.5 years, a decline from 19.6 in 2019. For males, life expectancy at age 65 was 17.0 in 2020 (down from 18.2 in 2019) and for females, it was 19.8 (down from 20.8 in 2020).
What Is Underlying Security?  

An underlying security is a stock or bond on which derivative instruments, such as futures, ETFs, and options, are based. It is the primary component of how the derivative gets its value.





Key Takeaways

An underlying security is a stock or bond on which derivative instruments, such as futures, ETFs, and options, are based.In most cases, the underlying security is the item which must be delivered by one party in the derivative contract and accepted by the other party. Traders use derivatives to either speculate on, or hedge against, the future price movements of the underlying security. 


   Understanding Underlying Security  

In derivative terminology, the underlying security is often referred to simply as "the underlying." An underlying security can be any asset, index, financial instrument, or even another derivative. The infamous collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) and credit default swaps (CDS), which were front and center in the Financial crisis of 2008, are also derivatives that depend on the movement of an underlying.



The role of the underlying security is merely to be itself. If there were no derivatives, traders would simply buy and sell the underlying. However, when it comes to derivatives, the underlying is the item which must be delivered by one party in the derivative contract and accepted by the other party. The exception is when the underlying is an index, or the derivative is a swap where only cash is exchanged at the end of the derivative contract.



There are many widely used and exotic derivatives, but they all have one item in common which is their basis on an underlying security or underlying asset. Price movements in the underlying security will necessarily affect the pricing of the derivative based upon it.



For example, a call option on Alphabet, Inc. (GOOGL) stock gives the holder the right, but not the obligation, to purchase Alphabet stock at a price specified in the options contract. In this case, Alphabet stock is the underlying security.



Traders use derivatives to either speculate on, or hedge against, the future price movements of the underlying. The more complex a derivative, the more significant the degree of speculation and hedging. For example, options on futures are bets on the future price of the futures contract, which in itself is a bet on the future price of the underlying.


   Underlying Security Example  

Let's say we are interested in buying a call option on Microsoft Corp. (MSFT). Buying a call gives us the right to buy shares of MSFT at a certain price during a certain period of time. Generally speaking, the value of the call option will increase alongside an increase in the share price of MSFT. Because the call option is a derivative, its price is tied to the price of MSFT. In this case, MSFT is the underlying security.



The underlying is also crucial to the pricing of derivatives. The relationship between the underlying and its derivatives is not linear, although it can be. Generally speaking, for example, the more distant the strike price for an out-of-the-money option is from the current price of the underlying, the less the option price changes per unit of movement in the underlying.



Also, the derivative contract may be written so that its price may be directly correlated, or inversely correlated, to the price of the underlying security. A call option is directly correlated. A put option is inversely correlated.
What is Underlying Profit?  

Underlying profit is a calculation made internally by a company to show what it believes is a more accurate reflection of how much money it generates. The number focuses on regular accounting cycle events and often excludes one-time charges or infrequent occurrences. Underlying profit differs from the required accounting profit that is recorded on financial statements and other mandatory documents that follow preset practices, rules, and regulations.





Key Takeaways

Underlying profit is calculated internally by a company to show what it believes to be an accurate reading of its profit position.The number focuses on regular accounting cycle events and often excludes one-time charges or infrequent occurrences.Each company has its own version of underlying profit, taking the accounting profit and then making adjustments as it sees fit.


   How Underlying Profit Works  

When companies publish their financials, generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) require them to disclose how much profit they generated. This is calculated by subtracting all dollar costs from revenue, the same calculation used to determine how much income tax to pay.



Often, companies will choose to supplement this figure with their own calculation. Underlying profit is designed to offer a more useful indicator of performance on a year-by-year basis.



Stripping out unusual, non-recurring costs, such as natural disaster damage charges, irons out random fluctuations and should, in theory, make it easier for investors to get a better idea of how the company’s profit from its everyday, standard business operations varies over several fiscal years.





Important

Companies often use underlying profit figures for business planning purposes.



The goal here is to eliminate any distractions caused by random occurrences. Losses or gains that do not regularly crop up, such as restructuring charges or the buying or selling of land or property, are usually not taken into account because they do not occur often and, as a result, are not deemed to reflect the everyday costs of running the business.



In general, only regular operating expenses considered to be predictable or required will be deducted from gross sales in order to arrive at the underlying profit. They can include the following:



Personnel expenses, including everything from payroll to training, are often considered to be operating expenses because salaries are often negotiated in advance and training costs are known from prior experience.
Facility expenses, including rent or mortgage payments (if applicable), utilities and insurance also qualify because costs have been pre-established by contract or other agreement.
Technology-related expenses, including software maintenance and upgrades.
Asset replacement


   Example of a One-Time Event Removed for the Calculation of Underlying Profit  

If a company is in full ownership of two buildings, and one is currently in use while one is sitting vacant, it may choose to sell the vacant building. While the sale of this asset must be recorded for standard accounting purposes, it is excluded from the calculation of underlying profit.



The sale of a large asset, such as a building, is not a standard part of the business's operation and is not expected to occur again soon. Though it has resulted in a form of income, it is not likely to be repeated in subsequent accounting cycles for the company.


   Advantages of Underlying Profit  

Aside from giving investors an indication of how much money a company makes from its standard business operations, underlying profit is also used by management for business planning.



A business plan is a functional road map providing direction as to how the company will operate and is often the founding document drafted by new ventures. From an accounting perspective, the business plan also denotes the expected expenses that must be covered over a particular period of time. 



When determining what operating costs can be reasonably covered, a business may prefer to remove any one-time or highly irregular financial transactions that may falsely inflate profit norms. This creates a plan based on more common occurrences that can be anticipated.


   Disadvantages of Underlying Profit  

Each company has its own version of underlying profit, taking the accounting profit and then making adjustments as it sees fit. Without clear guidelines on how to report underlying profit, these figures cannot be relied on to compare different firms.



Full freedom also means some of these calculations can be called into question. On occasions, firms exclude items that have a negative impact on GAAP earnings over several quarters and then promote their underlying profit figure actively as if it is the only number that merits attention.



It is important for investors to recognize the difference between accounting profit and underlying profit and gain a solid understanding of how the latter was calculated — companies will disclose this information in their financial statements.



Using the underlying profit figure can come in handy, alongside other financials, when assessing whether to invest in a company. That said, approach with caution and be sure to determine exactly why certain expenses were ignored before taking the figure at face value.
What is Underlying Retention  

Underlying retention is the net amount of risk or liability arising from an insurance policy or policies that is retained by a ceding company after reinsuring the balance amount of the risk or liability. The degree of underlying retention will vary depending on the ceding company's assessment of the risks involved in retaining part of the policy liability and the profitability of the insurance policy.


   Understanding Underlying Retention  

Underlying retention enables an insurer to avoid payment of the reinsurance premium. The insurer will generally retain the most profitable policies or their lowest-risk components while reinsuring less profitable, higher-risk policies.



Reinsurance, also known as insurance for insurers or stop-loss insurance, is the practice of insurers transferring portions of risk portfolios to other parties by some form of agreement to reduce the likelihood of paying a large obligation resulting from an insurance claim.



Reinsurance allows insurers to remain solvent by recovering some or all of amounts paid to claimants. Reinsurance reduces net liability on individual risks and catastrophe protection from large or multiple losses. It also provides ceding companies the capacity to increase their underwriting capabilities in terms of the number and size of risks.





Key Takeaways

Underlying retention enables insurers to avoid payment of the reinsurance premiums by retaining their lower-risk components.The ceding company assesses risks involved in retaining part of the policy liability to select policies that can be retained in its portfolio.Underlying retention is used in cases of non-proportional reinsurance. 



By covering the insurer against accumulated individual commitments, reinsurance gives the insurer more security for its equity and solvency and more stable results when unusual and major events occur. Insurers may underwrite policies covering a larger quantity or volume of risks without excessively raising administrative costs to cover their solvency margins. In addition, reinsurance makes substantial liquid assets available for insurers in case of exceptional losses.


   Underlying Retention in Reinsurance  

Under proportional reinsurance, the reinsurer receives a prorated share of all policy premiums sold by the insurer. When claims are made, the reinsurer bears a portion of the losses based on a pre-negotiated percentage. The reinsurer also reimburses the insurer for processing, business acquisition, and writing costs.



With non-proportional reinsurance, the reinsurer is liable if the insurer's losses exceed a specified amount, known as the priority or retention limit. As a result, the reinsurer does not have a proportional share in the insurer's premiums and losses. The priority or retention limit may be based on one type of risk or an entire risk category.



Excess-of-loss reinsurance is a type of non-proportional coverage in which the reinsurer covers the losses exceeding the insurer's retained limit. This contract is typically applied to catastrophic events, covering the insurer either on a per-occurrence basis or for the cumulative losses within a set time period.



Under risk-attaching reinsurance, all claims established during the effective period are covered, regardless of whether the losses occurred outside the coverage period. No coverage is provided for claims originating outside the coverage period, even if the losses occurred while the contract was in effect.


   Example of Underlying Retention  

Suppose that an insurance company has a reinsurance treaty limit of $500,000. It chooses to retain $200,000 worth of insurance risk as its underlying retention. That retained portfolio consists mostly of policies that are worth much less and carry significantly lower risk. For example, the company may choose to retain claims less than $100,000, which carry significantly less risk, in its portfolio. On the other hand, policies that for greater amounts, averaging say $100,00 in payouts, are reinsured. Thus, the reinsurer saves money on premium payments for low-risk policies.

An underpayment penalty is a fine levied by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) on taxpayers who don’t pay enough of their estimated taxes, don’t have enough withheld from their wages, or pay late. To avoid an underpayment penalty, individuals generally must pay at minimum either 100% of last year’s tax or 90% of this year’s tax.



Learn how underpayment penalties work and more about how you can avoid them.





Key Takeaways

An underpayment penalty is a fine levied by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) on taxpayers who don’t pay enough tax during the year through withholding and/or their estimated taxes, or who pay late.To avoid an underpayment penalty, individuals generally must pay the lesser of 100% of last year’s tax or 90% of this year’s tax.If your adjusted gross income (AGI) for last year exceeded $150,000, you must pay the lesser of 110% of last year’s tax or 90% of this year’s tax.Typically, underpayment penalties are 5% of the underpaid amount, and they’re capped at 25%.Underpaid taxes also accrue interest at a rate that the IRS sets annually.


   What Is an Underpayment Penalty?  

A tax penalty is imposed on individual or corporate taxpayers for not paying enough of their total estimated tax and withholding due. Taxpayers should consult IRS Form 2210 to determine if they are required to report an underpayment and pay a penalty.


   How Underpayment Penalties Work  

The tax law requires that taxpayers make payments as they realize income throughout the year through withholding, estimated taxes, or both. To avoid an underpayment penalty, individuals whose adjusted gross income (AGI) is $150,000 or less must pay the lesser of 90% of the current year’s tax or 100% of last year’s tax, by combining estimated and withholding taxes. Individuals whose AGI for the preceding taxable year exceeds $150,000 must pay the lesser of 90% of the tax due for the current year tax or 110% of the tax on the individual’s return for the prior taxable year.



The underpayment penalty is owed when a taxpayer underpays the estimated taxes or makes uneven payments during the tax year that do not correspond adequately to the taxpayer’s current income for a period. Taxpayers with self-employment income should take their liability for Social Security and Medicare taxes into account when calculating the amounts due.



Some taxpayers, such as sole proprietors, partners, and S corporation shareholders, must pay taxes in four equal payments during the year. In some cases, taxpayers who receive their income unevenly may be able to pay different amounts quarterly. Taxpayers should use IRS Form 2210 to determine if their payments of withholding and estimated taxes during the year are sufficient to avoid a penalty.



If taxpayers realize that they have underpaid, they must pay the difference—plus a penalty that is calculated based on the outstanding amount owed and how long the amount has been overdue. The penalty is not a static percentage or flat dollar amount. It’s based on several things, including the total underpayment amount and the period in which taxes were underpaid. Underpayments are subject to the failure-to-pay penalty, which is 0.5% of the amount owed for each month and the part of a month for which the tax is not paid.






The underpayment failure-to-pay penalty can’t be more than 25% of the unpaid amount.


  Interest Payments  

Along with a penalty, tax underpayments (or overpayments) accrue interest. The IRS determines the interest rate every quarter, generally basing it on the federal short-term rate, plus 3 percentage points, for most individual taxpayers.



For the fourth quarter (Q4) of 2022, the rates were:



6% for individual underpayments8% for large corporate underpayments (exceeding $100,000)



For the first quarter of 2023, the announced rates are 7% for individual underpayments, and 9% for large corporate underpayments.


   Example of Underpayment Penalty  

For example, if you owed $5,000 in taxes for the year, but only paid $2,000, you would have underpaid your taxes by $3,000.



Because the amount is more than $1,000 and you did not pay at least 90% of what you owed, you would be subject to an underpayment penalty (unless you met other criteria for avoiding it). The penalty would be the federal short-term rate plus 3 percentage points. For Q4 2022, that rate was 6%, or $180.


   How to Avoid an Underpayment Penalty  

The best way to avoid an underpayment penalty is to take steps to ensure that your tax obligations are fully paid on time.



You can also avoid the underpayment penalty if:



Your tax return shows you owe less than $1,000You paid 90% or more of the tax that you owed for the taxable year or 100% of the tax that you owed for the year prior, whichever amount is less



The underpayment penalty may also be waived by the IRS under several other scenarios, including:



The taxpayer was a U.S. citizen or resident for the preceding tax year and did not owe any taxes for that yearThe taxpayer missed a required payment because of a casualty event, disaster, or other unusual circumstanceThe underpayment was a result of reasonable cause and not willful neglectThe taxpayer retired after reaching age 62 during the current or preceding tax yearThe taxpayer became disabled during the tax year for which estimated payments were owed or during the preceding tax year


   Special Considerations  

If you do not qualify for the exceptions to the underpayment penalty, you may qualify for a reduced underpayment penalty in some situations. For example, an individual who changes their tax filing status from single to married filing jointly may get a reduced penalty due to the larger standard deduction.



A reduction might also be extended to taxpayers who generate significant portions of their income late in the calendar year. One such example is an investment holding that’s sold in December, triggering a substantial capital gains tax.




What Were the Underpayment Penalties for 2022?
For the fourth quarter (Q4) of 2022, Internal Revenue Service (IRS) underpayment penalties were 6% for individual underpayments and 8% for large corporate underpayments over $100,000. Underpayment penalties are the federal short-term rate plus 3 percentage points.




What Are the Underpayment Penalties for 2023?
For the first quarter (Q1) of 2023, the IRS underpayment penalties are 7% for most underpayments and 9% for large corporate underpayments.




What Are IRS "Safe Harbor" Rules?
“Safe harbor” rules allow you to not pay a penalty or to pay a reduced penalty if you meet certain conditions. An underpayment penalty with the IRS can be avoided if you meet conditions like owing less than $1,000 or paying more than 90% of your tax obligation for the year.




Can You Make Estimated Tax Payments All at Once?
Some taxpayers, such as sole proprietors, partners, and S corporation shareholders, must pay taxes quarterly if they will owe more than $1,000. Their payments are called estimated tax payments. You cannot pay estimated tax payments all at once. You must pay them each quarter.


   The Bottom Line  

If you don't pay enough taxes—estimated taxes, tax withholding, or taxes due—you could end up paying an underpayment penalty. If you're charged a penalty, check to see if you qualify for an exemption or reduced penalty. But the best way to avoid underpayment penalties is to be sure that you figure estimated taxes correctly and pay your taxes on time.
What Is Underperform?  

If an investment is underperforming, it is not keeping pace with other securities. In a rising market, for example, a stock is underperforming if it is not experiencing gains equal to or greater to the advance in the S&P 500 Index. In a down market, a stock that is a falling faster than the broader market is an underperformer. "Underperform" is also an analyst recommendation assigned to a stock when shares are expected to do slightly worse than the market return. The designation is also known as market "moderate sell" or "weak hold."





Key Takeaways

An underpeforming stock is not keeping pace with the broader market.The underpeform rating can have varying meanings depending the brokerage firms issuing the rating; it is sometimes called a weak hold or moderate sell.An analyst will assign an underperform rating when a stock is not expected to keep pace with the market, but the worries do not justify a sell rating.There are a number of reasons why a stock might receive an underperform rating, but most of the time, it comes as the result of comparing company metrics to those of peers or the overall market.


   Understanding the Underperform Designation  

Exact definitions vary between brokerages, but an "underperform" rating is worse, in general, than "neutral" but better than "sell" or "strong sell."



Neutral is assigned to a stock that is expected to deliver results that match the broader market.Underperform is a stock that will likely perform slightly below par: seeing greater losses in a down market and below-average gains in an up market.A sell rating is given to a stock that is expected to lose value.Strong sell reflects concerns that the company is in deep trouble and the stock could suffer substantial losses.



A security might receive the underperform designation if it does not meet or exceed a metric it is being compared against. The comparison might be against the overall market, a competing company, or an index. A variety of other issues could bring the underperform rating, such as concerns about the company's debt levels, price-to-earnings ratios, or loss of market share.


   Examples of Underperform Rating  

An industry might be described as underperforming. For example, the utilities industry might receive this designation because the growth of economy may boost the industry yet inflation could result in higher interest rates, which would be a negative for the utility sector. Similarly, the real estate market might have seen low interest rates drive investment in Real Estate Investment Trusts, but rising rates can change that dynamic. Those factors could create a circumstance where an industry is not generating returns to the full potential and an underperform rating is warranted.



A specific stock is assigned an underperform rating by an analyst if there are concerns that shares will not keep pace with others for various reasons, but those worries do not warrant an outright sell rating. For example, though a company sees growth or positive earnings for a quarter or for the year, those returns might not be on a par with the market. So if an automobile manufacturer reports a total return of 12% for its fiscal year, while the S&P 500 sees a 23% total return for that year, the auto manufacturer could be classified as underperform.



Depending on the brokerage house, an outlook rating of underperform can have different degrees of meaning. At Charles Schwab, for instance, an outlook of underperform also carries a sell guidance. If a company receives a "strongly underperform" outlook from the firm, it will also receive the sell guidance. These ratings can mean there is an expectation that the stocks will not meet benchmarks.
What Is Underpricing?  

Underpricing is the practice of listing an initial public offering (IPO) at a price below its real value in the stock market. When a new stock closes its first day of trading above the set IPO price, the stock is considered to have been underpriced.



Underpricing is short-lived because investor demand will drive the price upwards to its market value.


   Understanding Underpricing  

An initial public offering (IPO) is the introduction of a new stock for public trading on a stock exchange. Its purpose is to raise capital for the future growth of the company. 



Determining the offering price requires a consideration of many factors. Quantitative factors are considered first. Those are the numbers, real and projected, on cash flow.

An IPO may be underpriced deliberately in order to boost demand and encourage investors to take a risk on a new company.It may be underpriced accidentally because its underwriters underestimated the demand in the market for this company's stock.In any case, the IPO is considered underpriced by the difference between its first-day closing price and its set IPO price.



Nevertheless, there are two opposing goals at play. The company's executives and early investors want to price the shares as high as possible in order to raise the most capital and reward themselves most lavishly. The investment bankers who are advising them may hope to keep the price low in order to sell as many shares as possible since higher volume means higher trading fees for them.


  IPO Pricing Factors  

IPO pricing is far from an exact science, so underpricing an IPO is equally inexact. The process mixes facts, projections, and comparables:



Quantitative factors considered include the company's financials including its current sales, expenses, earnings, and cash flow. Projected earnings also are factored in.
An IPO price that reflects a price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple comparable to the company's industry peers is sought.
The size of the current and near-future market for the product or service that the company produces is considered.
The marketability of the company's stock in the current economic environment also is crucial.


  Why Underprice?  

In theory, any IPO that increases in price on its first day of trading was underpriced, whether it was deliberate or accidental. The shares may have been deliberately underpriced to boost demand. Or, the IPO underwriters may have underestimated investor demand.






Overpricing is much worse than underpricing. A stock that closes its first day below its IPO price will be labeled a failure.



An IPO can be underpriced if its sponsors are genuinely uncertain about the reception that the stock will receive. After all, in the worst case, the stock price will immediately climb to the price that investors consider that it's worth. Investors willing to take a risk on a new issue are rewarded. The company's executives are pleased.



That is considerably better than the company's stock price falling on its first day and its IPO being blasted as a failure.



Whether it was underpriced or not, once the IPO debuts the company becomes a publicly traded entity owned by its shareholders. Shareholder demand will determine the stock’s value in the open market going forward.
What Is Undersubscribed?  

"Undersubscribed" refers to a situation in which the demand for an issue of securities such as an initial public offering (IPO) or another offering of securities is less than the number of shares issued. Undersubscribed offerings are often a matter of overpricing the securities for sale or on account of poor marketing of the securities to potential investors.



This situation is also known as an "underbooking," and may be contrasted with oversubscribed when demand for an issue exceeds its supply.





Key Takeaways

Undersubscribed (underbooked) refers to an issue of securities where demand does not meet the available supply.An undersubscribed IPO is typically a negative signal as it suggests that people are not eager to invest in the company's issue or that it has not been marketed well.Underbooking can also arise if the issuer sets the offering price too high.Institutional or accredited investors are most often those eligible to subscribe to a new issue.


   Understanding Undersubscribed  

An offering is undersubscribed when the underwriter is not able to get enough interest in the shares for sale. Because there may not be a firm offering price at the time, purchasers usually subscribe for a certain number of shares. This process allows the underwriter to gauge demand for the offering (called “indications of interest”) and determine whether a given price is fair.



Typically, the goal of a public offering is to sell at the exact price at which all the issued shares can be sold to investors, and there is neither a shortage nor a surplus of securities. If the demand is too low, the underwriter and issuer might lower the price to attract more subscribers. If there is more demand for a public offering than there is supply (shortage), it means a higher price could have been charged, and the issuer could have raised more capital. On the other hand, if the price is too high, not enough investors will subscribe to the issue, and the underwriting company will be left with shares it either cannot sell or must sell at a reduced price, incurring a loss.


   Factors that Can Cause an Undersubscription  

Once the underwriter is sure it will sell all of the shares in the offering, it closes the offering. Then it purchases all the shares from the company (if the offering is a guaranteed offering), and the issuer receives the proceeds minus the underwriting fees. The underwriters then sell the shares to the subscribers at the offering price. Sometimes, when underwriters can't find enough investors to purchase IPO shares, they are forced to purchase the shares that could not be sold to the public (also known as "eating stock").



Although the underwriter can influence the initial price of the securities, they don't have the final say on all the selling activity on the first day of an IPO. Once the subscribers begin selling on the secondary market, the free-market forces of supply and demand dictate the price, and that can also affect the initial selling price on the IPO. Underwriters usually maintain a secondary market in the securities they issue, which means they agree to purchase or sell securities out of their own inventories in order to protect the price of the securities from extreme volatility.
What Is UCITS?  

The Undertakings for the Collective Investment in Transferable Securities (UCITS) is the European Commission's regulatory framework for managing and selling mutual funds. UCITS funds can be registered and sold in any country in the European Union using unified regulatory and investor protection requirements.



A UCITS is similar to a mutual fund in the U.S. They are registered in countries that belong to the European Union and regulated by the member states where they are registered. The European Commission publishes regular guidance for member regulatory authorities to follow to ensure these investment instruments are available and safe for EU citizens.



UCITS funds are perceived as safe and well-regulated investments. They are popular in Europe, South America, and Asia among investors who prefer not to invest in a single public limited company but rather among diversified unit trusts within their countries.



According to the European Commission, they account for about 75% of all collective investments by small investors in Europe. Many mutual fund providers use an expression such as "UCITS-compliant" as part of their marketing strategy. While the funds are regulated in Europe, buyers from all over the world can invest in EU UCITS funds if allowed by their country's securities laws.





Key Takeaways

UCITS stands for Undertakings for the Collective Investment in Transferable Securities.It is a regulatory framework that allows for the sale of cross-boundary mutual funds for EU member states.UCITS were created so that retail investors have transparent, regulated, and cross-border investment opportunities.UCITS funds are perceived as safe and well-regulated investments and are popular among many investors looking to invest across Europe.


   UCITS Versions  

UCITS versions use Roman numerals to indicate latest revisions. The first UCITS directive was adopted on Dec. 20, 1985, to facilitate cross-border offerings of investment funds to retail investors. In the early 1990s, proposals for modifications to the directive were made but never fully adopted. As such, there is no UCITS II.






UCITS are not only available in the EU. Several other countries or regions have these instruments. South Africa, Latin America, and Australia also use UCITS as a framework for creating funds.



In 2002, following discussions among member countries, two new directives were adopted. Directives 2001/107/EC and 2001/108/EC, together known as UCITS III, broadened the investment spectrum of UCITS funds and relaxed some restrictions for index funds.



UCITS IV, or Directive 2009/65/EC, brought about further technical changes and was adopted in July 2011.



UCITS V, or Directive 2014/91/EU, which went into effect in March 2016, aligns fund depositories' duties and responsibilities and fund managers' remuneration requirements with those of the Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive (AIFMD).



UCITS VI, or Directive 2021/2261/EC, went into effect on Jan.1, 2023. This directive requires UCITS to provide a summary of the key elements in each fund. Most notably, this summary must explain the costs, risks, and potential for returns. The summaries are known as Key Information Documents (KID).






If you buy into a UCITS through a broker, that broker doesn't manage the fund. It is managed by the company in the EU.


   UCITS Directives  

Not all directives receive a version number or designation. Sometimes, several are combined into the latest numbered version. Here are all of the proposed directives after 2009, with a short summary of their intent:



Directive 2009/65/EC, July 13, 2009 (UCITS IV): The UCITS directive that was fully enacted; it receives updates through other directives.Directive 2010/78/EU, Nov. 24, 2010: Gave more authority to financial regulators after the Great Financial Crisis of 2008 and amended various financial services laws. No longer in force.Directive 2011/61/EU, June 8, 2011: Implemented common requirements for alternative investment fund managers (AIFM) in the EU.Directive 2013/14/EU, May 21, 2013: Established the authority of the EU Commission to adopt measures to reduce fund managers' over-reliance on credit ratings when selecting investments.Directive 2014/91/EU, July 23, 2014 (UCITS V): Implemented policies to ensure sound and less risky practices involved in remunerations, depositaries, and sanctions.Directive (EU) 2019/1160, June 20, 2019: Amended 2009/65/EU to address issues affecting the cross-border distribution of UCITS and alternate investment funds.Directive (EU) 2019/2034, Nov. 27, 2019: Established a framework to ensure "the prudential supervision of investment firms." Additionally, the directive gave guidance on ethical investment firm management and encouraged the creation of a mechanism for the exchange of information between member states.Directive (EU) 2019/2162, Nov. 27, 2019: Established a framework for issuing covered bonds in the EU.Directive (EU) 2021/2261, Dec. 15, 2021 (UCITS VI): Established criteria for publishing key information about UCITS.




What Does UCITS Mean In Stocks?
Undertaking for collective investment in transferable securities (UCITS) is a regulatory framework for mutual funds in the European Union (EU). It governs how mutual funds are sold and managed.




What Is the Difference Between UCITS and ETF?
An exchange-traded fund (ETF) that is UCITS compliant is a type of fund that abides by the UCITS framework for funds based and managed in the EU.




Can U.S. Citizens Invest in UCITS?
Like many investments, you can buy UCITS funds through a broker that offers the service. U.S. citizens cannot invest in UCITS without using an authorized broker.




What Is the Difference Between UCITS and Non-UCITS?
Non-UTICS funds do not comply with UCITS guidelines. They are likely not open-ended and liquid, one of the more significant requirements for a fund to be UCITS compliant.


   The Bottom Line  

Undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities is a regulatory framework in the European Union that creates standards for funds to follow. Mutual funds and similar investments following these guidelines are considered to be UCITS compliant, which means they are designed with retail investors in mind.



The standards were created to give EU member citizens investment instruments and opportunities that are transparent, regulated the same, and diverse.
What Is Undervalued?  

Undervalued is a financial term referring to a security or other type of investment that is selling in the market for a price presumed to be below the investment's true intrinsic value. The intrinsic value of a company is the present value of the free cash flows expected to be made by the company. An undervalued stock can be evaluated by looking at the underlying company's financial statements and analyzing its fundamentals, such as cash flow, return on assets, profit generation, and capital management to estimate the stock's intrinsic value.



In contrast, a stock deemed overvalued is said to be priced in the market higher than its perceived value. Buying stocks when they are undervalued is a key component of famed investor Warren Buffett's value investing strategy.





Key Takeaways

An asset that is undervalued is one that has a market price less than its perceived intrinsic value.Buying undervalued stock in order to take advantage of the gap between intrinsic and market value is known as value investing. For a stock to be undervalued means that the market price is somehow “wrong” and that the investor either has information not available to the rest of the market or is making a purely subjective, contrarian evaluation. 


   Understanding Undervalued  

Value investing is not foolproof, however. There is no guarantee as to when or whether a stock that appears undervalued will appreciate. There is also no exact way to determine a stock's intrinsic value—which is essentially an educated guessing game. When someone says that a stock is undervalued, all they are essentially saying is that they believe the stock is worth more than the current market price, but this is inherently subjective and may or may not be based on a rational argument from business fundamentals.



An undervalued stock is believed to be priced too low based on current indicators, such as those used in a valuation model. Should a particular company’s stock be valued well below the industry average, it may be considered undervalued. In these circumstances, value investors may focus on acquiring these investments as a method of pulling in reasonable returns for a lower initial cost.



Whether a stock is actually undervalued or not is open to interpretation. If a valuation model is inaccurate or applied in the wrong way, it could mean the stock is already properly valued.


   Value Investing and Undervalued Assets   

Value investing is an investment strategy that looks for undervalued stocks or securities within the marketplace with the goal of purchasing or investing them. Since the assets can be acquired at a relatively low cost, the investor hopes to improve the likelihood of a return.



Additionally, the value investing methodology avoids purchasing any items that may be considered overvalued in the marketplace for fear of an unfavorable return.


   Undervaluation, Subjectivity, and Efficient Markets  

The idea that a stock can be persistently undervalued (or overvalued) in such a way that an investor can consistently achieve above-market returns by trading on these mispriced stocks, notably, conflicts with the idea that the stock market makes fully efficient use of all available information. If a stock were truly of greater intrinsic value than its market price, and this was readily ascertainable from its financial statements, then all market traders would have an immediate incentive to buy the stock, and in doing so bid up the price to its intrinsic value.



In other words, if markets are efficient then finding a truly undervalue stock should be near impossible (unless one has inside information not available to other market participants). This means that an investor who thinks a given stock is undervalued is inherently making a subjective judgment contrary to the rest of the market (barring insider information). It also means that the existence of successful value traders who can consistently outguess the market would be a challenge to the idea that markets are efficient.


   Value Investing vs. Values-Based Investing  

Values-based investing is the concept of buying shares in companies based on an investor's personal values. It different from value investing that looks for underpriced stocks. In this investment strategy, the investor chooses to invest based on what they personally believe in, even if market indicators do not support the position as profitable. This can include avoiding investments in companies with products that they do not support and directing funds to those they do.



For example, should an investor be against cigarette smoking, but support alternative fuel sources, they would invest their money accordingly. This type of investing implies that the investor considers first whether the product and sector are in line with their values.
What Does Underwater Mean?  

"Underwater" is the term for a financial contract or asset that is worth less than its notional value. More commonly though, the term is used in relation to a house, or another substantial asset, which has an outstanding mortgage or loan on the asset that is a larger amount than what the asset is worth.



In either case, the holder has an asset without intrinsic value. In the case of the mortgage or loan, the holder of the asset actually owes more than the asset is worth.



Underwater is sometimes also referred to as "upside-down."





Key Takeaways

Underwater means an asset is worth less than it was paid for.It commonly refers to having a loan on an asset that is larger than what the asset is worth.A homeowner is underwater if their mortgage is larger than what the home is worth.Underwater situations can often, but not always, be avoided by looking for good deals and creating a margin of safety between the asset's value and the loan amount.


   Understanding Underwater  

An asset is underwater if the price paid for it is more than its current market valuation. Broadly speaking any paper (unrealized) loss relates to an underwater asset.



More commonly, underwater relates to leverage or borrowing, where it means owning an asset that is worth less than an outstanding loan on that asset. In securities trading, this could happen in a margin account, where a trader owns a stock on leverage, but the company (stock) declares bankruptcy, and the stock holdings no longer cover the margin or loan the broker provided to buy the stock initially. The account is underwater, and the investor will need to find funds somewhere else to pay back the money (loan) they lost in the stock market. This is known as a margin call.



Such a situation can also occur with a non-financial asset. If a new car is purchased with a loan, the purchase almost immediately results in the buyer being underwater because the car will depreciate immediately once it is driven off the lot while the loan will be paid down slowly over years. Eventually, as more payments are made, and the car depreciates at a slower rate, the car will be back above water. For example, in 10 years the loan is paid off but the owner can probably sell the car for a few thousand dollars, depending on the make and condition of the vehicle.


   Special Considerations  

Being underwater on a loan isn't always a horrible thing. As long as payments are made, the loan is paid down and the underwater situation may end up being temporary. That said, underwater situations can be mostly avoided by looking for a margin of safety in regards to the asset being purchased and the loan amount.



Getting a good deal on a house or car, where the value of the asset could be sold for more than what is paid (given some time) will mean the loan amount is smaller and there is a larger buffer between the asset's value and the loan amount. This means the asset would need to fall in value more in order to be underwater. Compare that to a couple that overpays for a house, paying $300,000 in a bidding war for a house that is really only worth $280,000. Depending on how much they put down, they could be underwater immediately, or if housing prices fall they could be underwater substantially in a short amount of time.



Missing payments or incurring additional fees for violating the terms of the loan can increase the loan amount owing quickly. This can cause a loan to move underwater, or deeper underwater. Lenders are often willing to work out solutions with borrowers if the financial struggles are short-term, as the lender doesn't want to have to go through the struggle of selling an underwater asset to only partially pay back a loan at a loss.



If dealing with financial problems, talk to a financial planner, debt counselor, and/or the lender to help find a solution before the problem gets worse.


   Underwater Mortgages  

In real estate, underwater refers to the situation where a house or other property is worth less than the money owed on the loan. An underwater mortgage is thus a home loan with a higher principal than the free-market value of the home. This situation can occur when property values are falling. In an underwater mortgage, the homeowner may not have any equity available for credit. An underwater mortgage can potentially prevent a borrower from refinancing or selling the home unless they have the cash to pay the loss out of pocket.



This negative value presents problems for both the homeowner and the holder of the mortgage. If the homeowner needs to move, the sale of the home will not produce sufficient monies to pay the mortgage holder, even before any transaction fees. In this case, the homeowner must find additional funds or enter into a short sale with a third party. These types of problems, in turn, lead to legal battles and possible difficulties down the road for both the original homeowner and the third-party lender.



While a short sale does complicate the process by which the original lender recovers their money, a more significant problem with underwater mortgages emerged after the housing bubble in 2006-07 and bust in 2008-09. Homeowners owing more than their home's value quietly walked away from their investments. This resulted in mortgage defaults, leaving the lending banks with losses and the added expenses of liquidating their acquired homes.






Underwater mortgages were a common problem among homeowners around the height of the 2008 financial crisis, which among other things, involved a substantial deflation in housing prices. 


  Example of Being Underwater on a Mortgage  

Assume a person sees a house they like listed at $400,000. They have $40,000 for a downpayment, or 10%. Not including other fees and mortgage insurance, which will mean some of the downpayment won't be going to the principal, for simplicity assume that the buyer gets a loan for $360,000.



Using the mortgage and downpayment the buyer pays for the house. Several months after the purchase they notice similar houses in their area are selling for substantially less than $400,000. Similar homes, called comparables, are selling for $350,000. The loan value of $360,000 has only dropped incrementally to $359,000 as much of the initial payments go to interest and not principal, yet the house is only worth $350,000. If the house was sold, it could not pay off the loan. This is referred to as being underwater or upside down.



If the housing market stabilizes, eventually the loan will be paid down and the property loan will no longer be underwater. Being underwater a small amount, or for a short period of time, isn't a major issue. Being underwater for a long time and by a large amount indicates a poor purchase, poor timing, or poor market conditions. Possibly all three.



The house could be underwater for a number of reasons. Possibly the homebuyer overpaid in the first place. The house may have only been worth $350,000 all along, but the seller asked more and the buyer was willing to pay it.



Alternatively, the property value may have dropped. $400,000 may have been a good price at the time, but a recent downturn in the economy means fewer jobs and not as many people being able to afford their homes. Forced to sell, property values are driven down.






Property values often deteriorate slowly but can move quickly in certain areas. For example, a small town may see property values plummet very quickly if the main source of employment, say a plant or mine, closes.
What Is an Underwater Mortgage?  

An underwater mortgage is a home purchase loan with a higher principal than the free-market value of the home. This situation can occur when property values are falling. In an underwater mortgage, the homeowner may not have any equity available for credit. An underwater mortgage can potentially prevent a borrower from refinancing or selling the home unless they have the cash to pay the loss out of pocket.


   Breaking Down an Underwater Mortgage  

Underwater mortgages were a common problem among homeowners around the height of the 2008 financial crisis, which among other things, involved a substantial deflation in housing prices. While the market has greatly recovered due to support from monetary policy and interest rate stabilization, underwater mortgages are still a factor that property owners must follow closely when making a real estate investment.



Generally, a mortgage is considered underwater when the value of the home is less than the original mortgage principal. Depending on the decrease in the value of the home since its purchase, the borrower may also have no equity or negative equity. Equity on a home is associated with the value of the home versus the balance paid. A borrower with a $250,000 mortgage that sees their home value decrease to $225,000 is considered to have an underwater mortgage. If the borrower has paid half of the principal on their mortgage loan resulting in a principal balance of $125,000, then they still are considered to have positive equity of $100,000 which could be utilized in a home equity loan.


   The 2008 Financial Crisis  

The 2008 financial crisis had numerous effects on the U.S. economy. One such effect was a bursting housing bubble that substantially deflated real estate property values across the market. A primary catalyst for the housing value deflation was loose lending standards for borrowers providing for broader mortgage loan approvals. This loose lending specifically to subprime borrowers led to a heightened number of defaults and foreclosures which effected real estate property values across the U.S. market. This led to a variety of uncommon situations causing losses for borrowers across the market whose mortgage loan values exceeded their home’s fair market value.



Subsequently, monetary policy implementation from the Federal Reserve helped the U.S. economy to recover and housing prices to rebound. Lower interest rates following the crisis also helped to reduce mortgage payment burdens and increase some demand for real estate.


   Assessing Home Value  

Given new market initiatives from the Dodd-Frank legislation helping to improve mortgage lending standards, it is not likely that homebuyers will again see the substantial real estate price drops that occurred in 2008. However, the 2008 financial crisis did cause a new sense of market realization and caution across real estate investing. As such lenders are now more cautious about the mortgages they approve and homeowners are generally more careful about the mortgage debt they take on. Even with a new outlook on the market, though, homeowners still must closely follow home values and mitigate underwater mortgage risks.



To maintain a good understanding of a home’s value, a homeowner may choose to have the property appraised annually. Appraisals are also done regularly to calculate property taxes. An appraisal value will be based on a number of factors which may include national market trends, recent sales by similar properties in the region and neighborhood as well as the home’s individual amenities. Homeowners can also work to maintain a high home value for their home by doing regular renovations and actively supporting positive community activities.



In the event that someone finds themselves stuck with an underwater mortgage, working with one of the best mortgage refinancing companies is a solid way to potentially rid themselves of this burden.
What Is Underweight?  

Underweight refers to one of two situations in regard to trading and finance. An underweight portfolio does not hold a sufficient amount of a particular security when compared to the weight of that security held in the underlying benchmark portfolio. Underweight can also refer to an analyst's opinion regarding the future performance of a security in scenarios where it is expected to underperform.





Key Takeaways

Underweight refers to two different financial situations: (1) a portfolio that holds a smaller amount of a security when compared with a benchmark and (2) an analyst's opinion regarding the future performance of a security.An underweight portfolio is determined through basic math via percentage calculations while an underweight stock depends on the metrics the analyst chooses to use in their evaluation.An underweight portfolio is not necessarily a bad situation, it may mean the portfolio manager is not bullish on the asset.


   Understanding Underweight  

While an underweight portfolio can be identified through simple mathematics by determining what percentage of a portfolio is directed towards a particular asset, an underweight stock is identified on more flexible terms based on the variables chosen by the analyst who is making the determination.


   Underweight Portfolios  

An underweight portfolio occurs when the percentage, or weight, of a particular security within the managed portfolio is lower than what is held in the benchmark portfolio. For example, if the benchmark portfolio held a particular security with a weight of 20% and the investor portfolio only held a 10% weight in that security, it would be deemed to be underweight in the security in question.



A portfolio manager can make securities underweight if they believe those specific securities will underperform when compared to the other securities in the portfolio. For example, consider a security in the benchmark portfolio with a weight of 10%.



If the manager believes that the security will underperform over a certain time period, they can allocate the security a weight of less than 10% – say, to 8% – for that period. The 2% that is no longer directed towards that security can be allocated to other securities that have more positive outlooks in hopes of increasing the expected return for the overall portfolio.


   Underweight Stocks  

Analysts may refer to a security as underweight when the expected return is below the average return of the industry, the sector, or the market that has been chosen as a point of comparison. In this context, being underweight is similar to an expectation of poor performance and may be based on a few selected variables chosen by the analyst making the determination.



There is no set time frame or specific benchmark for an analyst to make this determination, which leads to variances based on analyst opinion and the exact variables chosen as a point of comparison. This can cause a stock to be considered underweight compared to one index, but not when compared to another, leading to two different recommendations.


   Example of Underweight  

Consider Fund ABC which tracks the benchmark index, Index DEF. Index DEF has a weighting of Apple stock as 10% of its portfolio. Fund ABC determines that the future outlook for Apple stock is not strong given various metrics its research team used to analyze the company and the outlook of the economy. Fund ABC determines that its percentage of shares that are Apple shares will only be 1.5% of the portfolio. Compared to the benchmark, Fund ABC is underweight in Apple stock.




Does Underweight Mean Sell?
When a stock analyst marks a stock as underweight, that is usually a sell opinion or a don't buy opinion. Either way, the underweight opinion means that the outlook for the stock is not strong.




What Does an Underweight Portfolio Mean?
An underweight portfolio is a fund whose portfolio holds fewer shares of a particular stock when compared to a benchmark. For example, a fund might hold 2% of a particular stock as a percentage of its total portfolio whereas the benchmark holds 10%. The fund would be underweight in that stock.




What Is an Overvalued Stock?
An overvalued stock is one whose stock price is not in line with its earnings outlook, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio. Analysts that believe a stock is overvalued expect that its price will fall.
WHAT IS Underwithholding  

Underwithholding is a term that refers to a specific tax situation in which an individual did not withhold an adequate amount of taxes from their wages during the year to cover the amount of taxes they owe.


   BREAKING DOWN Underwithholding  

Underwithholding is a term used to refer to an instance when an individual withheld an inadequate amount of taxes from wages or other income during the year to cover the amount owed to tax authorities. Withholding itself refers to the portion of an individual’s wages that are taken out of his or her paycheck to cover federal, state and local taxes.﻿﻿ The IRS calculates the amount of federal taxes withheld from the individual’s paycheck based on income, marital status, and choices made by the taxpayer regarding number of dependents claimed and filing status (married couples must decide whether to file jointly or separately). A taxpayer may also elect to have additional money withheld (for example, to cover a side job for which taxes are not being taken out automatically). Similarly, if a taxpayer expects to claim significant deductions on his or her annual taxes, a reduction in withholding can be requested.﻿﻿ Taxpayers register these preferences with their employer by completing Form W-4 Employee's Withholding Certificate. ﻿﻿



Paying taxes on one’s income directly from each paycheck reduces the amount of taxes owed when an individual submits an annual tax return.﻿﻿ If an individual has not paid in enough over the year to cover all of their tax obligations, they will have to pay the remaining balance when they file their income taxes. In addition, a penalty fee may be charged if a taxpayer has significantly underwithheld. To avoid this penalty, it is necessary to have paid at least 90 percent of taxes owed in the current year or 100 percent of those owed the previous year (taxpayers are allowed to use whichever figure is smaller). However, even if an individual does not meet this threshold, it is still possible to avoid a penalty if the amount of unpaid tax is less than $1,000 or if the person had no tax liability the previous year.﻿﻿ ﻿﻿


   Why Would an Individual Choose to Underwithhold?  

Some individuals deliberately choose to have their taxes underwithheld. For example, a taxpaper may take some of the funds that would have been withheld and invest that same amount. If the individual turns a profit, they come out ahead after paying their income taxes. However, it is important to remember that excessive underwithholding can result in a penalty. Also, a person who reduces their withholdings by purposefully claiming more allowances than they are entitled to on their W-4 form could theoretically be charged with supplying false or fraudulent information.﻿﻿


   Underwithholding’s Opposite: Overwithholding and its Benefits  

A taxpayer might also choose to do the opposite of underwithholding and instead overwithhold. An individual can accomplish this by withholding more than they will most likely owe in income tax. If an individual overwithholds, they will then receive a tax refund after they have filed their return. ﻿﻿ But, if an individual overpays their taxes they in essence give the Internal Revenue Service an interest-free loan.
What Is an Underwriter?  

An underwriter is any party, usually a member of a financial organization, that evaluates and assumes another party’s risk in mortgages, insurance, loans, or investments for a fee, usually in the form of a commission, premium, spread, or interest.



Underwriters try to determine the likelihood that a borrower will pay as promised and that enough collateral is available if there's a default. In the case of insurance, underwriters seek to assess a policyholder's health and other factors and spread the potential risk among as many people as possible.

   What Do Underwriters Do?  

Underwriters play a critical role in many industries in the financial world, including the mortgage industry, the insurance industry, equity markets, and some common types of debt securities trading. An individual in the position of a lead underwriter is sometimes called a book runner.



Modern-day underwriters play a variety of roles, depending on the industry in which they work. In general, underwriters are tasked with determining the level of risk involved in a transaction or other kind of business decision. Risk is the likelihood that an outcome or investment’s actual gains will differ from an expected outcome or return.



Investors rely on underwriters because they determine if a business risk is worth taking. Underwriters also contribute to sales-type activities. For example, in an initial public offering (IPO), the underwriter might purchase the entire IPO issue and sell it to investors. An IPO is a process through which a previously privately owned company sells its shares on a public stock exchange for the first time.


   History of Underwriters  

The term “underwriter” first emerged in the early days of marine insurance. Shipowners sought insurance for a ship and its cargo to protect themselves if the boat and its contents were lost. Shipowners would prepare a document that described their ship and its contents, crew, and destination.



An agreed-upon rate and terms were set out in the paper. Businesspeople who wished to assume some obligation or risk would sign their name at the bottom and indicate how much exposure they were willing to accept. These businesspeople became known as underwriters.


   Types of Underwriters  
  Mortgage Underwriters  

The most common type of underwriter is a mortgage loan underwriter. Mortgage loans are approved based on a combination of an applicant’s income, credit history, debt ratios, and overall savings.



Mortgage loan underwriters ensure that a loan applicant meets all of these requirements, and they subsequently approve or deny a loan. Underwriters also review a property’s appraisal to ensure that it is accurate and that the home is worth the purchase price and loan amount.



Mortgage loan underwriters have final approval for all mortgage loans. Loans that aren't approved can go through an appeal process, but the decision requires overwhelming evidence to be overturned.






According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, employment of insurance underwriters is projected to decline 4% from 2021 to 2031. 


  Insurance Underwriters  

Insurance underwriters, like mortgage underwriters, review applications for coverage and accept or reject an applicant based on risk analysis. Insurance brokers and other entities submit insurance applications on behalf of clients, and insurance underwriters review the application and decide whether to offer insurance coverage.



Insurance underwriters advise on risk management issues, determine available coverage for specific individuals, and review existing clients for continued coverage analysis.


  Equity Underwriters  

Underwriters administer the public issuance and distribution of securities—in the form of common or preferred stock—from a corporation or other issuing body in the equity markets. Perhaps the most prominent role of an equity underwriter is in the IPO process. 



IPO underwriters are financial specialists who work closely with the issuing body to determine the initial offering price of the securities, buy the securities from the issuer, and sell the securities to investors via the underwriter’s distribution network.



IPO underwriters are typically investment banks that have IPO specialists on staff. These investment banks work with a company to ensure that all regulatory requirements are satisfied.



To gauge interest in the investment, the IPO specialists contact a large network of investment organizations—such as mutual funds and insurance companies. The amount of interest received by these large institutional investors helps an underwriter set the IPO price of the company’s stock.






The underwriter also guarantees that a specific number of shares will be sold at that initial price and purchase any surplus.


  Debt Security Underwriters  

Underwriters purchase debt securities—such as government bonds, corporate bonds, municipal bonds, or preferred stock—from the issuing body (usually a company or government agency) to resell them for a profit. This profit is known as the underwriting spread.



An underwriter may resell debt securities directly to the marketplace or to dealers (who will then sell them to other buyers). When the issuance of debt security requires more than one underwriter, the resulting group of underwriters is known as an underwriter syndicate.




Why Are Underwriters Important?
Investors need underwriters to determine if a business risk is worth investing in. In addition, underwriters also contribute to the success of sales activities.




What Are Some Common Types of Underwriters?
A mortgage loan underwriter is one of the most common types of underwriters. Their job is to ensure that a loan applicant meets all requirements before approving or denying the loan. Another common type is insurance underwriters, who review applications for coverage and, based on their findings, accept or reject an applicant. Underwriters who work in the equity market must administer the public issuance and distribution of securities from a corporation or other entity in the form of common or preferred stock.




What Is a Book Runner?
A book runner is a primary underwriter or lead coordinator in issuing new equity, debt, or securities instruments. These types of underwriters also may coordinate with others to mitigate their own risk, for example, those representing companies in large, leveraged buyouts (LBOs). Because they combine the duties of an underwriter while coordinating the efforts of multiple involved parties and information sources, book runners become the central point for all information regarding the potential offering or issue.


   The Bottom Line  

An underwriter is any party, usually part of a larger financial organization, that evaluates and assumes, for a fee, another party’s risk in mortgages, insurance, loans, or investments. Underwriters work in many areas of finance, from the insurance industry to mortgage lending. They are critical to the mortgage industry, insurance industry, equity markets, and common types of debt securities trading because of their ability to ascertain risk.
What Is an Underwriter Syndicate?  

An underwriter syndicate is a temporary group of investment banks and broker-dealers who come together to sell new offerings of equity or debt securities to investors. The underwriter syndicate is formed and led by the lead underwriter for a security issue.



When an issue is too large for a single firm to handle, an underwriter syndicate is usually formed so that the resources of all the firms can be used to orchestrate the issuance and spread out the risk. The syndicate is compensated by the underwriting spread, which is the difference between the price paid to the issuer and the price received from investors and other broker-dealers when the issuance goes public.



An underwriter syndicate is also referred to as an underwriting group, banking syndicate, and investment banking syndicate.





Key Takeaways


An underwriter syndicate is a group of investment banks and broker-dealers formed temporarily to sell new issues of a company's equity or debt to investors.
The reason for an underwriter syndicate is to pool the resources of multiple firms when an issue is too large for one firm to take on.
An underwriter syndicate consists of a lead underwriter and the other participating members, where the risks of the underwriter role are spread across the syndicate.
The lead underwriter receives the largest portion of the issue for disbursement as well as the responsibility of dealing with regulatory bodies.
The profit or loss for the syndicate is determined by how the new stock performs on the market.



   Understanding an Underwriter Syndicate  

Under the firm commitment engagement, members of an underwriter syndicate are required to buy the shares from the company to sell to investors, as opposed to a company selling the shares directly to investors.



This removes a significant amount of risk for the issuing company as it is paid upfront for the shares by the syndicate and is, therefore, not concerned with having to sell the inventory of shares to investors; that risk is taken on by the underwriter syndicate. The risk that an underwriter syndicate takes on is mitigated, especially for the lead underwriter, by spreading the risk out among all the participants in the syndicate.



Since the underwriting syndicate has committed to selling the full issue, if demand for it is not as robust as anticipated, the syndicate participants may have to hold part of the issue in their own inventory, which exposes them to the risk of a price decline. In exchange for taking the lead role, the lead underwriter gets a larger proportion of the underwriting spread and other fees, while the other participants in the syndicate receive a smaller portion of the spread and fees.



Firm commitment may be compared to the best efforts underwriting, where the underwriter agrees to give their highest personal effort to sell as much as possible of the shares.


   The Process of an Underwriter Syndicate  

Members of an underwriter syndicate often sign an agreement that sets forth the allotment of the stock to each participant and the management fee, in addition to other rights and obligations.



The lead underwriter runs the syndicate and allocates shares to each member of the syndicate, which may not be equal among the syndicate members. The lead underwriter also determines the timing of the offering, as well as the offering price, and fulfilling any requirements with regulatory issues with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) or Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA).



In determining the offering price, the underwriter syndicate must obtain all the necessary financial information as well as determining the growth prospects of the firm. Typically, a closed bidding process amongst the syndicate members is held to arrive at the price of the initial public offering (IPO).



For popular initial public offerings, investors may exhibit a greater demand for shares than there are shares available. In this case, the IPO is oversubscribed. This kind of demand can only be met once shares begin actively trading on the exchange. This pent-up demand could lead to dramatic price swings during the first few days of trading.



As such, there is significant risk associated with individual investors participating in IPOs, either receiving shares as the client of an investment bank or by buying and selling shares once they begin trading.
What Is Underwriters Laboratories?  

Underwriters Laboratories (UL) is a global safety science company, the largest and oldest independent testing laboratory in the United States. Underwriters Laboratories tests the latest products and technologies for safety before they are marketed around the world. It tests 22 billion different products annually, ranging from consumer electronics, alarms and security equipment, to lasers, medical devices, and robotics.



Founded in 1894, Underwriters Laboratories offers its services in five strategic areas, from product safety, environment, life and health, university, and verification services. 



The company employs over 14,000 people who live in 40 countries. As of 2021, those employees are led by CEO Jennifer Scanlon. In 2012, Underwriters Laboratories created a for-profit subsidiary, UL LLC.

   Understanding Underwriters Laboratories (UL)  

Underwriters Laboratories is a non-profit organization funded by the fees it charges manufacturers of products submitted for certification. UL charges fees for the initial evaluation process, as well as ongoing maintenance fees for follow-up service. While UL is a profitable enterprise, that profit is filtered back into the business, as profit is not a stated goal of the company.



UL's operations are global in scope, with customers in more than 143 countries. Twenty-two billion UL Marks appear annually on products, while 8.5 million consumers in Asia, Europe, and North America are annually reached by UL with safety messages.


  History of Underwriters Laboratories  

The start of Underwriters Laboratories can be traced back to the widely-attended World’s Fair, held in Chicago in 1890. At the fair, UL’s founder, William Henry Merrill, Jr., a graduate of the MIT electrical engineering program, was working at his assigned post with the Boston Board of Fire Underwriters to assess for any fire risks with all of the new construction going on for the fairgrounds.



At the fair, Merrill, Jr. meets many insurance underwriters and proposes his idea to create an electrical testing laboratory. The underwriters agree that it is a good idea and both Western Insurance Union and the Chicago Underwriters Association give Merrill, Jr. funding to form what will soon become the Underwriters Electrical Bureau.



Eventually, that first Bureau became the Electrical Bureau of the National Board of Fire Underwriters. It set its mission, even back then, on promoting safe working and living conditions for people. In 1895, the organization hired its first employees.



The Bureau was officially operating with three staff members and a budget of $3,000 annually. In 1901, the organization officially became Underwriters Laboratories and established headquarters in Illinois.



Founder Merrill, Jr. became the manager of UL and a new president, Henry Clay Eddy, was named. In 1903, the UL began establishing its first set of safety standards, beginning with tin-clad fire doors.
What Is Underwriting?  

Underwriting is the process through which an individual or institution takes on financial risk for a fee. This risk most typically involves loans, insurance, or investments. The term underwriter originated from the practice of having each risk-taker write their name under the total amount of risk they were willing to accept for a specified premium.



Although the mechanics have changed over time, underwriting continues today as a key function in the financial world.





Key Takeaways

Underwriting is the process through which an individual or institution takes on financial risk for a fee. Underwriters assess the degree of risk of insurers' business.Underwriting helps to set fair borrowing rates for loans, establish appropriate premiums, and create a market for securities by accurately pricing investment risk.Underwriting ensures that a company filing for an IPO will raise the capital needed and provide the underwriters with a premium or profit for their services.Investors benefit from the vetting process of underwriting grants by helping them make informed investment decisions.

   How Underwriting Works  

Underwriting involves conducting research and assessing the degree of risk each applicant or entity brings to the table before assuming that risk. This check helps to set fair borrowing rates for loans, establish appropriate premiums to adequately cover the true cost of insuring policyholders, and create a market for securities by accurately pricing investment risk. If the risk is deemed too high, an underwriter may refuse coverage.



Risk is the underlying factor in all underwriting. In the case of a loan, the risk has to do with whether the borrower will repay the loan as agreed or will default. With insurance, the risk involves the likelihood that too many policyholders will file claims at once. With securities, the risk is that the underwritten investments will not be profitable.



Underwriters evaluate loans, particularly mortgages, to determine the likelihood that a borrower will pay as promised and that enough collateral is available in the event of default. In the case of insurance, underwriters seek to assess a policyholder's health and other factors and spread the potential risk among as many people as possible. Underwriting securities, most often done via initial public offerings (IPOs), helps determine the company's underlying value compared to the risk of funding its IPO.


   Types of Underwriting  

There are basically three different types of underwriting: loans, insurance, and securities.


  Loan Underwriting  

All loans undergo some form of underwriting. In many cases, underwriting is automated and involves appraising an applicant's credit history, financial records, and the value of any collateral offered, along with other factors that depend on the size and purpose of the loan. The appraisal process can take a few minutes to a few weeks, depending on whether the appraisal requires a human being to be involved.



The most common type of loan underwriting that involves a human underwriter is for mortgages. This is also the type of loan underwriting that most people encounter. The underwriter assesses income, liabilities (debt), savings, credit history, credit score, and more depending on an individual's financial circumstances. Mortgage underwriting typically has a “turn time” of a week or less.



Refinancing often takes longer because buyers who face deadlines get preferential treatment. Although loan applications can be approved, denied, or suspended, most are “approved with conditions,” meaning the underwriter wants clarification or additional documentation.


  Insurance Underwriting  

With insurance underwriting, the focus is on the potential policyholder—the person seeking health or life insurance. In the past, medical underwriting for health insurance was used to determine how much to charge an applicant based on their health and even whether to offer coverage at all, often based on the applicant’s pre-existing conditions. Beginning in 2014, under the Affordable Care Act, insurers were no longer allowed to deny coverage or impose limitations based on pre-existing conditions.



Life insurance underwriting seeks to assess the risk of insuring a potential policyholder based on their age, health, lifestyle, occupation, family medical history, hobbies, and other factors determined by the underwriter. Life insurance underwriting can result in approval—along with a range of coverage amounts, prices, exclusions, and conditions—or outright rejection.


  Securities Underwriting  

Securities underwriting, which seeks to assess risk and the appropriate price of particular securities—most often related to an IPO—is performed on behalf of a potential investor, often an investment bank. Based on the results of the underwriting process, an investment bank would buy (underwrite) securities issued by the company attempting the IPO and then sell those securities in the market.



Underwriting ensures that the company's IPO will raise the capital needed and provides the underwriters with a premium or profit for their service. Investors benefit from the vetting process that underwriting provides and its ability to make an informed investment decision.



This type of underwriting can involve individual stocks and debt securities, including government, corporate, or municipal bonds. Underwriters or their employers purchase these securities to resell them for a profit either to investors or dealers (who sell them to other buyers). When more than one underwriter or group of underwriters is involved, this is known as an underwriter syndicate.


   How Long Does Underwriting Take?  

The time frame for underwriting varies among different investment products, as the underwriter will have to spend some time examining the risk profile of each investment. Personal loans and insurance products are generally fairly simple to underwrite.


  Personal Loans  

For car loans, the process is managed by an algorithm that compares the applicant to other borrowers with a similar profile. This process takes only a few days at most, and in some cases, it is almost instantaneous.



Home mortgages tend to take longer because the underwriter will need to verify the borrower's income, employment, and credit history, which can take some time. Full approval for a home loan can take up to 45 days, although the underwriting process itself accounts for only a small part of this time frame.


  Insurance  

Underwriting insurance is the same as underwriting a loan, except that the insurers weigh the probability and size of the average claim compared to the premiums that they expect to collect. In the case of property and auto insurance policies, this is based on factors like the age of the insured, their geographical location, and their past history of making claims.



Life insurance policies are more complicated because they also account for the insured's medical history. Underwriting life insurance can also take a month or longer, although most decisions are issued in a few days.


  Stocks and Bond Issues  

Securities are the most complicated products to underwrite. When a company issues a bond or a stock offering, the underwriter (usually an investment bank) examines the company's accounts, cash flows, assets, and liabilities, and checks for any discrepancies. This can take anywhere between six and nine months.


   What Information Do Underwriters Look at?  

Whether they are lending money or providing insurance, underwriters examine the financials of each applicant to determine how much risk they are taking on and the likelihood of losing money. This is generally done by comparison to historical data: If applicants with a similar risk profile tend to default X% of the time, then the premiums or interest rate will be priced at a rate that assumes an X% probability of default.



Underwriters for personal loans and insurance will look at the available data of the applicant. For loans, they might examine the borrower's income, employment status, and credit history. They will also assess the value of any assets that are used for collateral. For life insurance, they might also look at their medical history, including risk factors such as smoking or drinking.



For securities, the underwriters will look at the financial situation of the issuer, such as their income statements, cash flow, debts, and any other potential liabilities, before pricing a bond or stock issue. They will also examine the issuer's credit rating, the institutional equivalent of a personal credit score.


   How Underwriting Sets the Market Price  

Creating a fair and stable market for financial transactions is the chief function of an underwriter. Every debt instrument, insurance policy, or IPO carries a certain risk that the customer will default, file a claim, or fail—a potential loss to the insurer or lender. A big part of the underwriter's job is to weigh the known risk factors and investigate an applicant’s truthfulness to determine the minimum price for providing coverage.



Underwriters help establish the true market price of risk by deciding on a case-by-case basis - which transactions they are willing to cover and what rates they need to charge to make a profit. Underwriters also help expose unacceptably risky applicants—such as unemployed people asking for expensive mortgages, those in poor health who request life insurance, or companies that attempt an IPO before they are ready—by rejecting coverage.



This vetting function substantially lowers the overall risk of expensive claims or defaults. It allows loan officers, insurance agents, and investment banks to offer more competitive rates to those with less risky propositions.




Where Did the Word Underwriting Come From?
The term "underwrite" originates in the 17th century when marine vessels would be underwritten for insurance risk for overseas voyages. The insurance company would sub-scribe (literally to write underneath or under-write) the policy by signing their name at the bottom of the document and acknowledging consent that the policy is in force.




What Is the Purpose of Underwriting Today?
Underwriting, whether for an insurance policy or a loan, revaluates the riskiness of a proposed deal or agreement. For an insurer, the underwriter must determine the risk of a policyholder filing a claim that must be paid out before the policy has become profitable. For a lender, the risk is of default or non-payment. Similarly, securities underwriting by investment banks evaluate newly issued shares and bonds to determine their risk-adjusted value.




Can an Underwriter Deny an Insurance Policy or Loan?
Yes, if the riskiness of a borrower or insurance policy applicant is deemed too great, the underwriter can either recommend higher rates or else deny the application entirely - so long as they are not breaking any anti-discrimination laws and are only evaluating objective risk metrics.




How Long Does the Underwriting Process Take?
With the advent of information technology, the underwriting process for insurers and lenders has shortened from a matter of weeks or months to just a few days or even hours in some cases.


   The Bottom Line  

Underwriting is the process of examining the financials of a loan or insurance application to determine how much risk they pose to a lender or insurer. This usually means checking the applicant's income, assets, and credit history to determine the likelihood that they will end up costing the underwriting institution more than they pay in premiums.
What Is Underwriting Agreement?  

An underwriting agreement is a contract between a group of investment bankers who form an underwriting group or syndicate and the issuing corporation of a new securities issue.





Key Takeaways

An underwriting agreement takes place between a syndicate of investment bankers who form an underwriting group and the issuing corporation of a new securities issue.The agreement ensures everyone involved understands their responsibility in the process.The contract outlines the underwriting group's commitment to purchase the new securities issue, the agreed-upon price, the initial resale price, and the settlement date.There are several ways of structuring an underwriting agreement including best efforts and firm commitment, among others.


   Understanding Underwriting Agreement  

The purpose of the underwriting agreement is to ensure that all of the players understand their responsibility in the process, thus minimizing potential conflict. The underwriting agreement is also called an underwriting contract.



The underwriting agreement may be considered the contract between a corporation issuing a new securities issue, and the underwriting group that agrees to purchase and resell the issue for a profit.



As mentioned above, the contract is generally between the corporation issuing the new security and investment bankers who form a syndicate. A syndicate is a temporary group of financial professionals formed to handle a large financial transaction that would be difficult to handle individually.



The underwriting agreement contains the details of the transaction, including the underwriting group's commitment to purchase the new securities issue, the agreed-upon price, the initial resale price, and the settlement date.






A best-efforts underwriting agreement is mainly used in the sales of high-risk securities.


   Types of Underwriting Agreements  

There are several different kinds of underwriting agreements: the firm commitment agreement, the best efforts agreement, the mini-maxi agreement, the all or none agreement, and the standby agreement.



Firm Commitment: In a firm commitment underwriting, the underwriter guarantees to purchase all the securities offered for sale by the issuer regardless of whether they can sell them to investors. It is the most desirable agreement because it guarantees all of the issuer's money right away. The more in demand the offering is, the more likely it will be done on a firm commitment basis. In a firm commitment, the underwriter puts its own money at risk if it can’t sell the securities to investors. Underwriting a securities offering on a firm commitment basis exposes the underwriter to substantial risk. As such, underwriters often insist on including a market out clause in the underwriting agreement. This clause frees the underwriter from its obligation to purchase all of the securities in case there is a development that impairs the quality of the securities. Poor market conditions, though, are not a qualifying condition. One example of when a market out clause could be invoked is if the issuer was a biotech company and the FDA just denied approval of the company's new drug. 
Best Efforts: In a best-efforts underwriting agreement, underwriters do their best to sell all the securities offered by the issuer, but the underwriter isn't obligated to purchase the securities for its own account. The lower the demand for an issue, the greater the likelihood it will be done on a best efforts basis. Any shares or bonds in a best efforts underwriting that have not been sold will be returned to the issuer.
Mini-Maxi: A mini-maxi agreement is a type of best efforts underwriting that does not become effective until a minimum amount of securities is sold. Once the minimum is met, the underwriter may then sell the securities up to the maximum amount specified under the terms of the offering. All funds collected from investors are held in escrow until the underwriting is completed. If the minimum amount of securities specified by the offering cannot be reached, the offering is canceled and the investors’ funds are returned to them.
All or None: With an all or none underwriting, the issuer determines it must receive the proceeds from the sale of all of the securities. Investors’ funds are held in escrow until all of the securities are sold. If all of the securities are sold, the proceeds are released to the issuer. If all of the securities are not sold, the issue is canceled and the investors’ funds are returned to them.
Standby Underwriting: A standby underwriting agreement is used in conjunction with a preemptive rights offering. All standby underwritings are done on a firm commitment basis. The standby underwriter agrees to purchase any shares that current shareholders do not purchase. The standby underwriter will then resell the securities to the public.
What Is Underwriting Capacity?  

Underwriting capacity is the maximum amount of liability that an insurance company agrees to assume from its underwriting activities. Underwriting capacity represents an insurer’s ability to retain risk. It's important for an insurance company to calculate and maintain its underwriting capacity so it will be able to pay out claims to customers when needed so as to avoid insolvency.





Key Takeaways

Underwriting capacity is the maximum liability that an insurance company is willing to assume from its underwriting activities.When an insurer accepts additional hazards through the issuance of policies, the possibility increases that it may become insolvent.The more risk that an insurance company assumes by underwriting new insurance policies, the more premiums it can collect and later invest.To protect policyholders, regulators prohibit insurance companies from underwriting an unlimited number of policies.


   Understanding Underwriting Capacity  

Underwriting involves assessing the degree of risk associated with offering insurance to an applicant. As the provider of the policy, the insurer will diligently seek to determine if it’s profitable to offer coverage and then, based on its research, establish a price. This price is known as the premium, and it is charged in exchange for taking on the risk of covering the applicant against loss.



Through the issuance of new policies, an insurer accepts additional hazards and increases the possibility that it may become insolvent. Though seemingly unlikely, there’s always a slight chance that too many policyholders will file claims all at once, leaving the insurer forced to make a number of large payments beyond its financial means.



At the same time, an insurance company’s potential for profitability depends on its appetite for risk. The more risk it assumes by underwriting new insurance policies, the more premiums it can collect and later invest.



Striking the right balance is essential to maintaining and improving the financial health of the insurer. In other words, a company's underwriting capacity, or the maximum amount of acceptable risk, is a crucial component of its operations. An insurance company’s profitability hinges on the quality of its underwriting.

Insurers are not given free rein to choose how much risk they want to take on. To protect policyholders, regulators prohibit insurance companies from underwriting an unlimited number of policies by capping their capacity.



Often, the insurer will impose even stricter constraints on itself to stave off the threat of insolvency. Applications can be rejected outright if the risk is deemed too high, or revised with new, specific individual conditions attached.


   Methods Used to Increase Underwriting Capacity  

Smart underwriting practices should generate premiums that exceed losses and expenses, increasing the policyholder surplus and capacity to issue more policies. Listed below are some of the common methods used by insurers to protect themselves from paying out an excessive amount of claims and to help them build up their ability to take on more business.


  Being Picky  

An insurance company can increase its underwriting capacity by underwriting policies that cover less volatile risks. For instance, a company may refuse to write new property insurance coverage in a hurricane-prone zone, but still cover hazards from fire and theft. Limiting the risk of policies reduces the likelihood that the company will have to pay out claims. 


  Sharing the Load  

Insurers are also able to increase underwriting capacity by ceding their obligations to a third party, as with reinsurance treaties.



In a reinsurance contract, the reinsurer assumes some of an insurer’s liability in exchange for a fee or a portion of the premiums paid by the policyholder. The liabilities assumed by the reinsurer no longer count against the ceding company's underwriting capacity, enabling the insurer to underwrite new policies.


   Special Considerations  

In the case of sharing the load, using reinsurance does not mean that the insurer can abandon the liabilities it cedes in the reinsurance contract. The ceding company is still ultimately responsible if a claim should occur.



In a situation where the reinsurer becomes insolvent, the ceding insurer must pay for claims made against its original underwritten policies. It is, therefore, critical for the insurer to be aware of the financial health of the reinsurer, including the amount of risk that the reinsurer has agreed to take on through other reinsurance contracts.
What Is an Underwriting Cycle?  

The underwriting cycle refers to fluctuations in the insurance business over a period of time. A typical underwriting cycle spans a number of years, as market conditions for the underwriting business go from boom to bust and back to boom again. An underwriting cycle is also known as an "insurance cycle."





Key Takeaways

The underwriting cycle refers to fluctuations in the insurance business over a period of time.The fluctuations in the underwriting cycle consist of market conditions that go from a boom cycle to a bust cycle and over again.The underwriting cycle starts with many competitors and low premiums and then after a surge in claims and insurance company insolvencies, competition declines, and premiums go up.After this period, net entrants enter the market, increasing competition, resulting in a reduction in premiums and the underwriting cycle starts again.The underwriting cycle is one of the biggest challenges that insurance companies face and they constantly try to manage it to the best of their abilities.


   Understanding an Underwriting Cycle  

The underwriting cycle represents the ebb and flow of business between soft and hard insurance markets. At the beginning of an underwriting cycle, business is soft due to increased competition and excess insurance capacity, as a result of which premiums are low. Then, a natural disaster or other event leads to a surge in insurance claims, which drives lesser-capitalized insurers out of business.



Decreased competition and lower insurance capacity lead to better underwriting conditions for surviving insurers, enabling them to raise premiums and post solid earnings growth. As the insurance claims are paid off and the tide of new claims subsides, insurance companies slowly return to profitability. New insurance companies then enter the market, offering lower premiums and looser requirements than the existing companies. The existing companies are then compelled to loosen their requirements to stay competitive, and the insurance cycle starts all over again.



The underwriting cycle perpetuates because a majority of insurance companies place short-term gains over long-term stability, selling insurance without concern for what happens when the soft market ends. The only way to effectively regulate or insulate an insurance company against the effects of the insurance cycle is to ignore short-term profitability and focus on saving capital. An insurance company may also consider establishing limits and setting money aside in a "rainy day" type of account. Disciplined efficiency can have a considerable effect on a firm's financial stability and long-term business prospects.


   Managing an Underwriting Cycle  

As with most business cycles, the underwriting cycle is a phenomenon that is very difficult to eliminate. The concept has been an understood phenomenon since at least the 1920s and has since been treated as a core concept in the industry. In 2006, insurance giant Lloyd's of London identified managing this cycle as the top challenge facing the insurance industry and published a report by surveying more than 100 underwriters about industry issues. In response to their survey, they were able to identify steps to manage the insurance cycle.



Most insurance industry watchdog organizations believe that underwriting cycles are inevitable due to the inherent uncertainty of matching insurance prices to future losses. Unfortunately, the industry as a whole is not responding to the challenges the underwriting cycle brings. The underwriting cycle affects all types of insurance except life insurance, where there is enough information to minimize risk and reduce the effect of the underwriting cycle.
What Are Underwriting Expenses?  

Underwriting expenses are costs and expenditures associated with underwriting activity. Underwriting expenses include a wide range of expenditures, and the exact definition differs for insurers and investment banks. As a major expense category, the lower these expenditures are as a proportion of underwriting activity, the higher the profitability of the insurer or investment bank.





Key Takeaways

Underwriting expenses are the cost of performing underwriting activities.For insurance companies, this includes underwriting insurance policies, and for investment banks, it includes securities underwriting for companies launching an initial public offering (IPO).Underwriting expenses include all expenses related to the business, such as actuarial reviews, inspections, due diligence, legal fees, and accounting fees.The goal for any company is to keep underwriting expenses as low as possible to have the highest net income possible.The expense ratio for insurance companies determines the portion of insurance premiums (revenues) that are used towards paying underwriting expenses.


   Understanding Underwriting Expenses  

Underwriting expenses are primarily associated with insurance companies as the cost of doing business, which is underwriting insurance policies. For an insurer, underwriting expenses may include direct costs, such as salaries, commissions, actuarial reviews, and inspections, as well as indirect costs, such as accounting, legal, and customer service expenses.



For an investment bank, underwriting usually relates to the process of underwriting securities for a company's initial public offering (IPO). Underwriting expenses would include such costs as due diligence activities, research, and legal and accounting fees.


   Underwriting Expenses and the Expense Ratio  

For insurance companies, calculating the expense ratio allows for it to determine the portion of insurance premiums (revenue) that must go towards paying underwriting expenses. The expense ratio for an insurer is obtained by dividing underwriting expenses by premiums for a given period. Since the profitability of an insurer has an inverse correlation with the expense ratio, insurers strive to keep this ratio in check in order to remain profitable.



Depending on the insurer, the underwriting expenses can be vastly different. If the entity is a well-known insurer, it might not have to advertise as much. On the other hand, a new insurance company has to advertise significantly, as well as incur expenses in starting a new business and paying stronger salaries and commissions to attract premium talent to generate business.



Some insurers have low expense ratios because of economies of scale; most notably with large national advertising budgets and well-known brand names that help attract customers. Other insurers employ direct-sales techniques to cut out the insurance agents and brokers and the underwriting expenses that come with them.



In the auto insurance industry, for example, GEICO, a unit of Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A), and Progressive (PGR) have contributed to their own long-term success by eliminating the middleman, similar to how Dell's (DELL) direct sales method gives it a pricing advantage over competitors. Given the presence of the Internet, direct sales methods are more common than they were.



It's important to stress that any claims that insurance companies pay out on insurance policies written are not included as underwriting expenses. The expenses are purely the cost of running a business.
What Are Underwriting Fees?  

Underwriting fees are monies collected by underwriters for performing underwriting services. Underwriters work in a variety of markets including investments, mortgages, and insurance. In each situation, the underwriter's job varies slightly, yet each collects underwriting fees in exchange for his or her underwriting services.





Key Takeaways

An underwriter is a financial firm that takes on risks, such as loans, insurance, or investments, in exchange for a fee.An underwriting fee is a payment that a firm receives as a result of taking on the risk.With securities underwriting, a firm earns a fee as compensation for underwriting a public offering or placing an issue in the market.In addition to securities, underwriters are commonly used in the mortgage and insurance industries.


   How Underwriting Fees Work  

In capital markets, underwriting fees are collected by underwriters who administer the issuing and distributing of certain financial instruments. When a company issues stock, bonds, or other publicly traded securities, for instance, it hires an underwriter.



The issuing company and the underwriter work closely together to determine the price of an offering. After determining the offer structure, underwriters assemble a group of investment banks and brokerage firms that commit to selling a certain percentage of the offering. After an underwriting agreement is struck, the underwriter bears the risk of being unable to sell the underlying securities and the cost of holding them on its books until they can be sold. Once the underwriter knows it will sell all of the shares in the offering, it closes the offering by purchasing all the shares from the company (if the offering is a guaranteed offering), and the issuer receives the proceeds minus the underwriting fees, usually 3.5 to 7 percent of the amount of capital being raised.



Underwriters or underwriter syndicates earn underwriting fees for doing three things: negotiating and managing the offering, assuming the risk of buying the securities (if nobody else will), and managing the sale of the shares.


   Underwriting Fees for Mortgage Underwriters  

A mortgage underwriter earns underwriting fees by evaluating and verifying mortgage loan applications and either approving or denying the loan.



An underwriting fee for the service of evaluating the loan application for approval is a nonrecurring fee that the lender may charge in lieu of an origination fee, or in addition to it. Origination fees pay for numerous costs associated with obtaining a loan and could include administrative services, such as loan processing and mortgage broker fees. Other loan fees can include an appraisal, a credit report, flood certification, and a tax service fee. When charged apart from origination, underwriting costs between $400 and $900, depending on the lender and loan type.


   Underwriting Fees for Insurance Underwriters  

Insurance underwriters collect underwriting fees for identifying and calculating a policyholder's risk of loss and by writing the policies to cover these risks. An insurance underwriter's job is to protect the company's book of business from risks that they feel will make a loss and issue insurance policies at a premium that is appropriate for the risk exposure.
What Is an Underwriting Group?  

An underwriting group is a temporary association of investment bankers and broker-dealers who wish to purchase a new issue of securities from an issuer in order to distribute the issue to investors at a profit. The underwriting group shares the risk and aids in the successful distribution of the new securities issue once the issuance goes public. 



An underwriting group is also called a purchase group, a distributing syndicate, or a syndicate.





Key Takeaways

An underwriting group is a temporary association of investment bankers and broker-dealers who wish to purchase a new issue of securities from an issuer in order to distribute the issue to investors at a profit.The underwriting group shares the risk and aids in the successful distribution of the new securities issue once the issuance goes public. The group buys the issuance from the firm first at a specified price and then sells it to the public (as opposed to a company selling the shares directly to investors.)Then, the underwriting group resells the issue to investors in order to make a profit; the profit is referred to as the underwriting spread.


   How an Underwriting Group Works  

An underwriting group manages the distribution of a new securities issue, such as a single company stock or a bond. The group buys the issuance from the firm first at a specified price and then sells it to the public (as opposed to a company selling the shares directly to investors.) Then, the underwriting group resells the issue to investors in order to make a profit.



For the issuing company, having an underwriting group means that they are paid upfront for the shares they are issuing. As a result, a significant amount of risk is removed from the issuing company and taken on by the underwriting group. The issuing company no longer has to sell the inventory of its stock directly to investors. The profit or loss for the group is determined by how the new stock performs on the market. (If there is a profit, it is the difference between the purchase price and the resale price.) This difference is also known as the underwriting spread.



Coming together temporarily as an underwriting group allows investment bankers and institutions to finance a high-volume purchase that would be out of reach for one banker or institution. However, once all the securities are sold off to investors, there is no reason for the group to exist anymore. At this point, an underwriting group disbands, and the individual bankers and financial entities are free to come together in underwriting groups for other, separate securities issues.



In an underwriting group, there is typically one lead underwriter. The lead underwriter is responsible for dealing with regulatory bodies. The lead underwriter may also receive the largest portion of the issue for distribution.


   Underwriting for Investment Banking vs. Underwriting for Insurance  

Underwriting has applications in both investment banking and the insurance sector. However, it means different things in these distinct industries; an underwriting group is a different entity in investment banking than in insurance.



In investment banking, underwriting is the process of joining together with other financial entities to purchase large volumes of a new security that is being issued. After this, the shares are resold or distributed to investors. This process is transactional; underwriting groups come together for a temporary amount of time to buy and then sell a specific security.



In the insurance industry, underwriting is the process of calculating risk and payouts and calculating the costs of purchasing insurance for different objects, situations, and entities. Insurance underwriting can be done by a group or an individual, and an underwriting group can exist over long periods of time and through multiple contracts and policies with a variety of policyholders. The main function of an insurance underwriting group is not to pool funds to purchase securities but to do calculations of risk and determine the correct rate for an insurance policy.
What Is Underwriting Income?  

Underwriting income is the profit generated by an insurer's underwriting activity over a period of time. Underwriting income is the difference between premiums collected on insurance policies by the insurer and expenses incurred and claims paid out. Huge claims and disproportionate expenses may result in an underwriting loss, rather than income, for the insurer. The level of underwriting income is an accurate measure of the efficiency of an insurer's underwriting activities.





Key Takeaways

Underwriting income is the profit generated by an insurance company through its course of business.The difference between premiums collected on insurance policies and business expenses plus claims paid out is the underwriting income.Underwriting income can be an indicator of how much new business an insurance company is bringing in or how well its risk analysis process is in predicting the number of insurance claims needing to be paid out.If an insurance company can generate positive underwriting income, it is in a better financial place and will not have to rely on investment income or writing riskier policies.


   Understanding Underwriting Income  

When an insurance company writes an insurance policy for a new client or renews a policy for an existing client, they receive an insurance premium as payment. This is their revenue. The costs associated with an insurance company are the ordinary business costs as well as money paid out to clients when they file an insurance claim for an accident or other such event. The difference between revenue and costs, like any business, is the income, in this case, the underwriting income.



An insurer's underwriting income may fluctuate from quarter to quarter, with natural and other disasters such as earthquakes, hurricanes, and fires leading to huge underwriting losses. Hurricane Katrina, the largest natural catastrophe in U.S. history, caused an underwriting loss of $2.8 billion for the U.S. property/casualty insurance industry in the first nine months of 2005, compared with underwriting income of $3.4 billion in the corresponding period of 2004.



Withstanding extreme events, such as earthquakes and hurricanes, underwriting income is an indicator of how well an insurance company is performing. If the underwriting income is consistently negative, the insurance company could not be bringing in enough new business (underwriting new policies) to generate more revenue.



Conversely, it can also indicate that the policies that it is writing are risky, resulting in claims being paid out often. This might shed light on the fact that the risk analysis an insurance company is performing on a business or individual when underwriting a policy is not accurate.



It's important for an insurance company to find a balance because if it is constantly paying out claims more than it is bringing in through underwriting revenue, this could lead to the inability to pay out future claims or insolvency.


   Underwriting Income vs. Investment Income  

Underwriting income is calculated as the difference between an insurance company's earned premiums and its expenses and claims. For example, if an insurer collects $50 million in insurance premiums over a year, and spends $40 million in insurance claims and associated expenses, its underwriting income is $10 million.



Investment income, meanwhile, comes from capital gains, dividends, and other investments related to the purchase and sale of securities.  



It's important when analyzing an insurance company, including the company's management, that they not look at overall income or profits, but also focus on underwriting income, to determine how well the business is performing through its core operations.


   Underwriting Income and the Underwriting Cycle  

The underwriting cycle is the periodic rise and fall of the insurance industry's underwriting income. The sources of this cycle aren't completely clear; however, since the swings in investment income are mild, fluctuations in underwriting income drive this cyclical rise and fall.



The number of insurance company insolvencies is proportional to the fall of underwriting income. Large drops in underwriting income can indicate that the underlying insurance policies are under-priced in the market or that the insurance companies are writing riskier policies, resulting in losses.



Insurance companies with solidly performing underwriting income are generally stronger financially because they don't have to make up for poor performance by increasing their risks on the investment side of the business or by underwriting riskier policies.
What Is Underwriting Risk?  

Underwriting risk is the risk of loss borne by an underwriter. In insurance, underwriting risk may arise from an inaccurate assessment of the risks associated with writing an insurance policy or from uncontrollable factors. As a result, the insurer's costs may significantly exceed earned premiums. 





Key Takeaways

Underwriting risk is the risk of uncontrollable factors or an inaccurate assessment of risks when writing an insurance policy.If the insurer underestimates the risks associated with extending coverage, it could pay out more than it receives in premiums.With securities, underwriting risk is the risk of sudden market changes or the risk of overestimating the demand for an underwritten issue.


   How Underwriting Risk Works  

An insurance contract represents a guarantee by an insurer that it will pay for damages and losses caused by covered perils. Creating insurance policies, or underwriting typically represents the insurer’s primary source of revenue. By underwriting new insurance policies, the insurer collects premiums and invest the proceeds to generate profit.



An insurer’s profitability depends on how well it understands the risks it insures against and how well it can reduce the costs associated with managing claims. The amount an insurer charges for providing coverage is a critical aspect of the underwriting process. The premium must be sufficient to cover expected claims but must also take into account the possibility that the insurer will have to access its capital reserve, a separate interest-bearing account used to fund long-term and large-scale projects.



In the securities industry, underwriting risk usually arises if an underwriter overestimates demand for an underwritten issue or if market conditions change suddenly. In such cases, the underwriter may be required to hold part of the issue in its inventory or sell at a loss.


   Special Considerations  

Determining premiums is complicated because each policyholder has a unique risk profile. Insurers will evaluate historical loss for perils, examine the risk profile of the potential policyholder, and estimate the likelihood of the policyholder to experience risk and to what level. Based on this profile, the insurer will establish a monthly premium.



If the insurer underestimates the risks associated with extending coverage, it could pay out more than it receives in premiums. Since an insurance policy is a contract, the insurer cannot claim they will not pay a claim on the basis that they miscalculated the premium.



The amount of premium that insurers charge is partially determined by how competitive a specific market is. In a competitive market composed of several insurers, each company has a reduced ability to charge higher rates because of the threat of competitors charging lower rates to secure a larger market share.


   Requirements for Underwriting Risk  

State insurance regulators attempt to limit the potential for catastrophic losses by requiring insurers to maintain sufficient capital. Regulations prevent insurers from investing premiums, which represent the insurer’s liability to policyholders, in risky or illiquid asset classes. These regulations exist because one or more insurers becoming insolvent due to an inability to pay claims, especially claims resulting from a catastrophe, such as a hurricane or a flood, can negatively impact local economies.



Underwriting risk is an integral part of the business for insurers and investment banks. While it is impossible to eliminate it entirely, underwriting risk is a fundamental focus for risk mitigation efforts. The long-term profitability of an underwriter is directly proportional to its mitigation of underwriting risk.
What Is Underwriting Spread?  

An underwriting spread is the difference between the dollar amount that underwriters, such as investment banks, pay an issuing company for its securities and the dollar amount that underwriters receive from selling the securities in a public offering. The underwriting spread is essentially the investment bank's gross profit margin, typically disclosed as a percentage or in points-per-unit-of-sale.





Key Takeaways

The underwriting spread is the difference between the amount that an underwriter pays an issuer for its securities and the total proceeds gained from the securities during a public offering. The spread marks the underwriter's gross profit margin, which is subsequently deducted for other items such as marketing costs and the manager's fee.The underwriting spread will vary on a deal-by-deal basis depending on several factors.


   Understanding Underwriting Spread  

The size of underwriting spreads is determined on a deal-by-deal basis and is influenced mainly by the underwriter's perceived risk in the deal. This will also be influenced by expectations for the demand of the securities in the market. 



The size of the underwriting spread depends on the negotiations and competitive bidding among members of an underwriter syndicate and the issuing company itself. The spread increases as the risks involved with the issuance increase.



The underwriting spread for an initial public offering (IPO) usually includes the following components:



The manager's fee (earned by the lead)
The underwriting fee (earned by syndicate members)
The concession (given to the broker-dealer marketing the shares)



The manager is usually entitled to the whole underwriting spread. Each member of the underwriting syndicate then gets a (not necessarily equal) share of the underwriting fee and a portion of the concession. Additionally, a broker-dealer, which is not itself a member of the underwriter syndicate, earns a share of the concession based on how well it does selling the issue.






The value of an underwriting spread can be influenced by variables such as the size of the issue, risk, and volatility.



Proportionately, the concession increases as total underwriting fees rise. Meanwhile, the management and underwriting fees decrease with gross underwriting fees. The effect of size on the division of fees is usually due to differential economies of scale. The extent of investment banker work, for example, in writing the prospectus and preparing the roadshow, is somewhat fixed, while the amount of sales work is not. Larger deals will not involve exponentially more investment banker work.



However, it might involve much more sales effort, requiring an increase in the proportion of the selling concession. Alternatively, junior banks may join a syndicate, even if they receive a smaller share of the fees in the form of a lower selling concession.


   Example of an Underwriting Spread  

To illustrate an underwriting spread, consider a company that receives $36 per share from the underwriter for its shares. If the underwriters turn around and sell the stock to the public at $38 per share, the underwriting spread would be $2 per share.
What Are Underwriting Standards?  

Underwriting standards are guidelines established to ensure that safe and secure loans are issued and maintained.



The underwriting standards in place help to set benchmarks for how much debt may be issued to a person, the terms of the loans, how much debt a specific company is willing to issue, and what interest rates will be charged.





Key Takeaways

Underwriting standards are guidelines set by banks and lending institutions for determining whether a borrower is worthy of credit (i.e. a loan). Underwriting standards help set how much debt should be issued, terms, and interest rates. These standards help protect banks against excessive risk and losses.The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) has previously published recommendations for underwriting standards, which include looking at credit history and assessing income sources. 


   How Underwriting Standards Work  

Sound underwriting standards protect financial institutions from excessive risks that can lead to losses. History indicates that lending and underwriting standards are generally pro-cyclical. As competitive pressures increase for loan growth, banks may be enticed to ease underwriting standards to expand the loan portfolio in order to generate earnings. As conditions begin to deteriorate, this easing of underwriting standards can cause banks to face an increased risk, followed by rising losses and an eventual tightening of underwriting standards.



For example, during the financial crisis of 2008-2009, some lenders reduced prepayment fees and offered heightened flexibility on the terms of the loans they issued. During that same crisis, many companies also tightened underwriting standards (one of the culprits in the downturn).


   Requirements for Underwriting Standards    

The choice to modify a financial institution's lending terms and underwriting standards is usually the result of decisions made by the board and senior management. Alternatively, subtle, de facto revisions in policies can result from how standards and procedures are actually applied in practice. In both instances, appropriate risk management steps must be taken to ensure risks are properly identified, monitored and controlled, and that loan pricing, terms or other safeguards against nonperformance are appropriate for the risks being taken.



A Federal Reserve study of lending practices outlined six core lending terms and underwriting standards for maintaining strong credit discipline and assuring smart credit decisions. Those standards include:



Formal credit policies should communicate a bank’s risk appetite while providing specific guidance and measurement standards along with a consistent process for approving and monitoring exceptions.Formal credit approval processes should be independent of line lending functions.Standardized loan approval documents should be used that promote consistent financial analysis, collateral valuation, guarantor support, and covenant provisions. Use forward-looking tools to assess projections and various scenarios that focus on key determinants of performance.Use risk rating systems that accurately assess quantitative and qualitative considerations to evaluate credit risk at inception and during the life of the loan.Ensure management and lender information systems support the approval process and ongoing monitoring of portfolio composition and risk positions.


   Example of Underwriting Standards  

The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) has its own recommended guidelines for underwriting standards for credit cards. Per the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), underwriting standards help ensure credit cards offered to customers meet an acceptable level of risk.



Some of the key underwriting standards that the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) recommends for credit cards include: 



Assessment of the applicant’s repayment willingness and capacity.Credit history and performance on past and existing obligations. Income assessments, such as self employment income, investment income, etc.Consideration of the borrower’s aggregate credit relationship with the bank.
What Are Undisclosed Reserves?  

Undisclosed reserves include unpublished or "hidden" reserves that may not appear on public documents—such as on the balance sheet—but are nonetheless real assets and are considered as such by most banking institutions.



Bank reserves are the cash minimums that financial institutions must keep on hand. The Federal Reserve (Fed) sets the requirements in order to ensure that banks have enough money on hand to cover withdrawals.





Key Takeaways

Undisclosed reserves are on the books of a financial institution, but "hidden" from the public and not listed on financial statements.Undisclosed reserves are included as part of Tier 2 capital along with general loan-loss and revaluation reserves.Some countries' regulatory environments do not recognize undisclosed reserves as assets.


   Understanding Undisclosed Reserves  

Undisclosed reserves relate to capital requirements in the banking industry and are designated as Tier 2 capital. Tier 2 is designated as the second or supplementary layer of a bank's capital and is less liquid than Tier 1 capital.



Undisclosed reserves are included in Tier 2 capital and will occur through provisions or when a bank charges expenses against a P&L. These items are not disclosed and not visible on public statements, such as the balance sheet. Tier 2 capital, or supplementary capital, also includes a number of important and legitimate constituents of a bank's capital requirement. Five items can typically be included in Tier 2 capital calculations:



Undisclosed reserves
Revaluation reserves
General loan-loss reserves
Hybrid debt-equity capital instruments
Subordinated term debt



Tier 1 capital, which is also known as core capital, is more liquid and consists of equity capital and disclosed reserves (e.g. retained earnings). Tier 1 capital is the money the bank has on its books while it undertakes lending, investing, trading, or other risky transactions. Simply put, Tier 1 funds support banks when losses are absorbed so that business functions do not have to be shut down.



Tier 1 and Tier 2 capital requirements were largely standardized in the Basel I accord, issued by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision and left untouched by the Basel II accord. National regulators of most countries around the world have implemented Tier 2 standards in local legislation. In the calculation of regulatory capital, Tier 2 is limited to 100% of Tier 1 capital.﻿﻿


   Undisclosed Reserves Special Considerations  

Preferred or accepted forms of capital and collateral have grown in importance, particularly after the banking crisis during 2008 and 2009. Bank stress tests, which were conducted in response to numerous taxpayer-funded bailout programs, highlighted how certain assets and reserves were woefully inadequate during the volatile markets of the Great Recession.



In practice, undisclosed reserves are not common but are accepted by some regulators where a bank has made a profit, but the profit has not appeared in normal retained earnings or in general reserves of the bank. It is fairly standard for undisclosed reserves to be accepted by a bank's supervisory authorities. However, many countries do not accept undisclosed reserves as an accounting concept or even as a legitimate form of capital.
What Is an Undivided Account?  

An undivided account is an initial public offering (IPO) for which there are multiple underwriters, each taking responsibility for placing any shares that remain unsold. That is, each firm agrees to pick up the slack if other underwriters fail to sell the portion of the total number of shares that they have been allocated.



This type of account is sometimes called an eastern account. Naturally, there is a variation called a western account.





Key Takeaways

In an undivided or eastern account, each underwriter accepts responsibility for selling any shares that remain unsold by other members of the syndicate.Underwriters are the financial firms that manage the process of preparing the IPO, up to and including establishing a price for the shares and selling them. In a western account, each underwriter takes responsibility only for its own share of the total.The risks and potential rewards are greater in an undivided account.The eastern account is the most common arrangement as an underwriter who participates in an eastern account with a consortium can share in a percentage of the profits while committing a relatively small amount of money in advance.


   Understanding Undivided Accounts  

When a company prepares to launch an IPO of stock or bonds, it hands off responsibility for marketing its shares to one or more underwriters. These are the financial firms that manage the process of preparing the IPO, up to and including establishing a price for the shares and selling them. Those first buyers include large financial institutions and brokerages.



In an undivided or eastern account, one underwriter might be responsible for placing 15% of an issue while others take up the rest. If the entire issue is not placed, the firm with 15% must assist in placing the remainder.



In a western account, each underwriter takes responsibility only for placing the percentage of shares it was assigned. The share of liability is divided among the underwriters according to the size of their allotment of the total shares available.


   Underwriting Accounts and Agreements  

Underwriters in investment brokerages assume considerable risk in managing new issues of bonds or stocks. The underwriter agrees to upfront to pay the issuer a certain amount of money regardless of the sale price at issue.



To offset some of this risk, many firms enter into syndication agreements that spread the risks and rewards of underwriting the new issue. Most syndicates are administered by one of the participating firms, and the eastern account is the most common arrangement. Both the risks and the rewards are greater than they are with western accounts. An underwriter who participates in an eastern account with a consortium can share in a percentage of the profits while committing a relatively small amount of money in advance.


   Terms of an Eastern Agreement  

Underwriters may include a market-out clause in the agreement. This clause frees the underwriter from the purchase obligation in case of a development that impairs the quality of the securities or that adversely affects the issuer. The clause is limited in its application, however. Poor market conditions or over-pricing do not qualify.



The terms are specified in the syndicate agreement, which also is called the underwriting agreement. The syndicate agreement details the fee structure. In addition to the money the syndicate member receives when selling shares or bonds, the agreement specifies the percentage of shares or bonds that each syndicate member commits to selling.



The syndicate manager can set up an underwriting on a western or eastern account basis. Types of underwriting agreements vary and include firm commitment agreement, best efforts agreement, mini-max agreement, all or none agreement, and standby agreement.
What Is Undivided Profit?  

Undivided profits refer to gains from current and past years that have not been transferred to a surplus account or distributed as dividends to shareholders. Often times, financial gains or budget surpluses are set aside in a separate account designated as a surplus account, are earmarked for distribution as dividends, or assigned to another purpose such as funding a project. 



Essentially, undivided profit refers to corporate earnings that have been allowed to accumulate over a period of time as opposed to being disbursed for other purposes.





Key Takeaways

Undivided profits refer to gains from current and past years that have not been transferred to a surplus account or distributed as dividends to shareholders.Current earnings may be credited to the undivided profits account and will eventually either be distributed to shareholders in the form of dividends or will be held within the company in the form of retained earnings.Undivided profit can also be thought of as a company's overall profits that are re-invested into the company.


   Understanding Undivided Profit  

Current earnings may be credited to the undivided profits account and will eventually either be distributed to shareholders in the form of dividends or will be held within the company in the form of retained earnings. Dividend distributions signal strong financial strength within the company while retained earnings can be used to further future growth. The desired strategy may depend on the amount of profit generated and the potential for value-maximizing projects.



Undivided profit typically reflects a public company's earnings after tax. Since undivided profits are not earmarked for dividends like funds in a surplus account are, at least until they are transferred to a surplus account, they are counted as part of the company's equity. Undivided profit can also be thought of as a company's overall profits that are re-invested into the company (when not given as dividends).



This distinction between a bank's undivided profits account and its surplus or surplus fund account was explicitly recognized by the United States Supreme Court in 1925, with Edwards v. Douglas. The ruling stated: “By incorporated banks, the term (undivided profits) is commonly employed to designate the account in which profits are carried more or less temporarily, in contradistinction to the account called surplus in which are carried amounts treated as permanent capital, and which may have been derived from payments for stock in excess of par, or from profits which have been definitely devoted to using as capital.”﻿﻿


   Example of Undivided Profit  

The question of whether undivided profits counted as part of the capital or surplus of banks came up in 1964 with the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, which debated how to count this allocation of money.



After examining the Supreme Court ruling, the then-president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas stated that it was of the Board’s opinion that "undivided profits do not constitute 'capital,' 'capital stock,' or 'surplus' for the purposes of provisions of the Federal Reserve Act, including those that limit member banks with respect to loans to affiliates, purchases of investment securities, investments in bank premises, loans on stock or bond collateral, deposits with nonmember banks, and bank acceptances, among others."﻿﻿
What Is Undue Influence?  

Undue influence occurs when an individual is able to persuade another's decisions due to the relationship between the two parties. Often, one of the parties is in a position of power over the other due to elevated status, higher education, or emotional ties. The more powerful individual uses this advantage to coerce the other individual into making decisions that might not be in their long-term best interest.



Undue influence is an equitable doctrine that involves one person taking advantage of a position of power over another person. This inequity in power between the parties can vitiate one party's consent as they are unable to freely exercise their independent will. In exerting undue influence, the influencing individual is often able to take advantage of the weaker party. In contract law, a party claiming to be the victim of undue influence may be able to void the terms of the agreement.





Key Takeaways

Undue influence most commonly occurs when a more powerful party exerts its influence over a less powerful party in order to achieve its desired outcome.Depending on the measure of influence and if there were any extraneous factors involved, some agreements can be legally voided.Undue influence varies widely in size, from the basic favor to multibillion-dollar transactions.


   Understanding Undue Influence  

Undue influence occurs when an individual is able to use an advantage to coerce another party's decisions. Often, this coercion occurs to the detriment of the weaker party and the gain of the more powerful or influential party. Some relationships, such as one between a patient and a doctor or a parent and a child, are considered to run the risk of undue influence and are legally outlined.



The onus in this type of relationship is on the person with influence to prove that he was not using his position to take advantage of the other party. In other situations, one party, based on previous interactions, can be accused of using the trust of the other party to his advantage.


   Example of Undue Influence  

For example, Bert is Ernie's therapist. Bert is also involved in a couple of real estate development deals around town. Ernie starts talking to Bert about how he has heard about units for sale in the complex that Bert is invested in developing. Ernie isn't interested and doesn't feel it's appropriate for him to purchase a home at that time, but feels left behind by his friends who are all purchasing units or making other investments in the project.



Bert uses his place of power over Ernie to convince him that it's a good step forward in his life also to make an investment in the project. This is to Ernie's financial detriment, but it increases the value of Bert's investment. Bert has used undue influence.


   Undue Influence in Financial Markets  

There is a pandemic of undue influence in the financial markets of the world. It can be as simple as leveraging information someone has on someone else in order to induce a sale or purchase, or it can be as complicated as forcing board members to vote a certain way. Having third-party counsel, or a mediator, present when deals or large trades are occurring can help to mitigate instances of undue influence.
What Is an Unearned Discount?  

An unearned discount is an interest or a fee that has been collected on a loan by a lending institution but has not yet been counted as income (or earnings). Instead, it is initially recorded as a liability. As the life of the loan progresses, proportionate parts of the fee or interest collected up front are removed from the liability side of the balance sheet and counted as income. If the loan is paid off early, the unearned interest portion must be returned to the borrower.



An unearned discount is more commonly referred to as unearned interest.





Key Takeaways

Unearned discount refers to loan interest that has been collected but is not yet recognized as income.Instead, an unearned discount is recorded as a liability that is gradually converted into income as the load matures over time.Unearned discount is more commonly known as unearned interest.


   Understanding Unearned Discounts  

An unearned discount account recognizes interest deductions before being classified as income earned throughout the term of the outstanding debt. Over time, then, the unearned discount creates an increase in the lender's profit and a subsequent decrease in liability.



Not all interest that is received by a lender is classified as "earned". This is because lenders often pre-schedule regular payments to be made at the beginning of each month. But, the interest paid by the borrower at the beginning of the month applies to the cost of borrowing for the entire month and, therefore, has not been earned by the lender.



For example, say that a homeowner obtains a mortgage that requires them to make a monthly payment on the 1st of each month in the amount of $1,500, with $500 representing the interest portion. However, this $500 in interest is meant to cover the entirety of the month, and it's considered to be unearned on the 1st as it is prepaid. As the month progresses, a pro-rata amount of that interest is credited to the bank's earnings while the liability of the unearned discount is made smaller.


   Calculating an Unearned Discount  

Unearned discounts may be estimated under the so-called Rule of 78, which is a method used for loans with precomputed finance charges. If the loan is repaid or early or refinanced, the Rule of 78 can determine the unearned discount to the lender. This works as follows:



Unearned discount = F [k (k + 1) / n (n + 1)]



where:



F = total finance charge, which is equal to (n x M – P)M = regular monthly loan paymentP = original loan amountn = original number of paymentsk = number of remaining payments on the loan after the current payment


   Example of Unearned Discount  

Snuffy's Bank and Trust have made a loan to Ernie's Brokerage. As part of the up-front costs of the loan, Ernie was required to pay a financing charge of 6% of the total loan amount. The total loan amount is $10,000 and will be repaid over 5 years in monthly installments. The amount of the finance charge paid up front by Ernie was $600.



Initially, Snuffy's Bank and Trust record the $600 unearned discount as a liability on its books. As Ernie pays each of the 60 loan payments (12 per year for 5 years), 1/60th of the $600 will be removed from the liability side of the balance sheet and recognized as income.
What Is Unearned Income?  

The term unearned income refers to any income that is not acquired through work. Put simply, unearned income is any money you earn by doing nothing. This is in contrast to earned income, which is any compensation received for performing a service like work. There are many types of unearned or passive income, including interest from savings accounts, bond interest, alimony, and dividends from stocks.





Key Takeaways

Unearned income is not acquired through work or business activities.Examples of unearned income include inheritance money and interest or dividends earned from investments.Tax rates on unearned income are different from rates on earned income.Unearned income, which can serve as a supplement to earned income before retirement, is often the only source of income in postretirement years.Unearned income is directly contrasted with earned income, which is compensation paid for performing a service.


   Understanding Unearned Income  

As noted above, unearned income is any money that is earned passively. It differs from earned income, which is any form of compensation gained from employment, work, or business activities. 



Unearned income cannot be contributed to individual retirement accounts (IRAs). According to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), earned income includes wages, salaries, tips, and self-employment income. 



Taxation differs for unearned income and earned income due to qualitative differences. The tax rates also vary among unearned income sources. Most unearned income sources are not subject to payroll taxes, and none of it is subject to employment taxes, such as Social Security and Medicare.






Make sure you understand the origin and taxation of any of your unearned income.


   Types of Unearned Income  
  Interest  

Interest and dividend income are the most common types of unearned income. Money received this way is unearned income, and the tax paid on it is considered an unearned income tax. Interest income is normally taxed as ordinary income on sources that earn income, including:



Checking and savings deposit accounts
Loans
Certificates of deposit (CDs) 



There are certain exceptions to this rule, including interest earned on municipal bonds, which is exempt from federal income tax.


  Dividends  

Dividends, which are income from investments, can be taxed at ordinary tax rates or preferred long-term capital gains tax rates. Investments typically yield dividends payable to shareholders on a regular basis. Dividends may be paid to the investment account monthly, quarterly, annually, or semi-annually.



Taxation of dividends is based on whether the dividend is ordinary or qualified:



Ordinary dividends, the more common form of dividends that investors receive from a company, are taxed at ordinary tax rates.
Qualified dividends, on the other hand, are taxed at the more favorable capital gains tax rates. In order to qualify as qualified dividends, they must be issued by a U.S. corporation or qualified foreign corporation, the investor must own them for at least 60 days out of a 121-day holding period, and they cannot be in a category of dividends otherwise excluded from the qualified dividend classification.


  Other Sources  

You may get unearned income from other sources, such as:



Retirement accounts like 401(k)s, pensions, and annuities
Inheritances
Alimony
Gifts
Lottery winnings
Veterans Affairs (VA) benefits
Social Security benefits
Welfare benefits
Unemployment compensation
Property income


   Benefits of Unearned Income  

Unearned income can serve as a supplement to earned income before retirement, and it is often the only source of income in postretirement years. During the accumulation phase, taxes are deferred for many sources of unearned income.



Sources of unearned income that allow a deferment of income tax include 401(k) plans and annuity income. As a result, participants avoid IRS penalties and higher tax rates. 






Tax advisors often recommend diversifying holdings to even out the effect of taxes on unearned income.


   Examples of Unearned Income  

Here are a couple of hypothetical examples to show how unearned income actually works.


  Example 1  

Let's say Jan invests $50,000 in a CD. The interest she derives from her investment is considered unearned income and must be reported to the IRS for taxation at the ordinary income rate. She also wins $10,000 on a game show, but she does not get the full amount of her winnings. Why? Because the IRS deducts taxes from it, treating the amount as unearned income.


  Example 2  

Now let's suppose that Michael buys an investment property with the intention to rent it out for additional income. He fixes it up and converts it into two apartments: the main unit and the basement as a separate studio. He signs leases with two different tenants who pay their rent to Michael on the first of each month. The tenants' rent payments are considered unearned or passive income because Michael isn't doing any work to earn them.




What Are Some Types of Unearned Income?
Unearned income is income not earned from work. Examples include inheritance money, a financial prize, unemployment benefits, interest on a savings account, and stock dividends.




Do I Have to Pay Tax on Unearned Income?
Usually, yes. Though not subject to employment taxes, such as Social Security and Medicare, and, in most cases, payroll taxes, unearned income is generally treated as taxable income—save for a few exceptions such as life insurance proceeds.




How Much Tax Will I Pay on Unearned Income?
Unearned income is not taxed uniformly. Some sources of unearned income are taxed as ordinary income, whereas others enjoy more generous tax rates. It's also possible with some types of unearned income to defer tax liabilities to a later date.




What's the Difference Between Unearned Income and Earned Income?
Unearned income is any form of income you earn passively. Examples include interest on investments, dividends, lottery or casino winnings, and rental income from investment properties. Earned income, on the other hand, is any compensation you receive for providing a service. This may be from your employer, a self-employment gig, tips, bonuses, and vacation pay.




What Is the Tax Treatment of Unearned Income for a Child?
According to the IRS, there are two possibilities that affect the reporting of a child's unearned income. Any unearned income above $2,200, such as interest or dividends, may be subject to an unearned income tax. This is known as the kiddie tax. Alternatively, interest and dividend income of less than $11,000 may be included on the parent's return rather than that of the child.


   The Bottom Line  

Unearned income isn't a term with which most people are familiar. You may know it as passive income or money that you acquire without providing a service. Put simply, you make this money without actually working for it. Sources may include interest income from interest-paying accounts, dividends, and rent from tenants if you have an investment property. Just because it means it is earned passively doesn't mean you don't have to report it on your tax return. In fact, the opposite is true. Be sure to check with the IRS or the issuer of the unearned income, or you can consult a tax professional if you're unsure of what your unearned means to your tax liability.
What Is Unearned Interest?  

Unearned interest is interest that has been collected on a loan by a lending institution but has not yet been recognized as income (or earnings). Instead, it is initially recorded as a liability. If the loan is paid off early, the unearned interest portion must be returned to the borrower.



Unearned interest is also called unearned discount.


   BREAKING DOWN Unearned Interest  

Interest recorded in the books of financial institutions as a result of lending activities is either earned or unearned. Earned interest, as the name implies, is interest income that is earned over a specific period of time from investments that pay the lender a regular series of mandated payments. Interest earned can be generated from bonds through interest payments made to bondholders after a stated period of time.






Unearned interest has been collected but is not recognized as income (or earnings). It is initially recorded as a liability.



Not all interest that is received by a lender is earned. Most lenders schedule loan payments to be made at the beginning of the month. The interest paid by borrowers to compensate lenders for lending them funds for a specified period of time represents interest income to the lender. However, the interest paid by the borrower at the beginning of the month applies to the cost of borrowing for the entire month and, therefore, has not been earned by the lender. For example, assume a borrower, on the first of each month, makes his regular $1,200 payment on a loan of which $240 is the interest portion. The $240 is the borrower’s cost for making use of the loan for the entire month. Since he prepaid the interest, the $240 will not be earned by the lending institution because the principal of the loan has not been outstanding long enough. To recognize this transaction, the cash account is debited (increase in cash) and the unearned interest income account on the ledger is credited. This shows that the bank records such income but recognizes the interest portion as unearned.



If the loan is paid off early, the unearned portion must be returned to the borrower. For example, assume a borrower takes out a 36-month loan on a car. If she pays off the entire loan after 30 months, she will be refunded 6 months interest unearned. This is the amount she will save by paying off the loan early.


   Amortization of Unearned Interest  

Unearned interest is an accounting method used by lending institutions to deal with long-term, fixed-income securities. Initially recorded as a liability, the unearned interest will eventually be recorded as income in the lending institution's books over the life of the loan as time passes and the interest is earned. This accounting process is referred to as amortizing unearned interest.



When amortizing unearned interest, a portion of the income is allocated to one period at a time. To amortize prepaid interest, the unearned interest income account is debited and the interest income account is credited.


   Calculating Unearned Interest  

Unearned interest can be estimated using a method known as the Rule of 78. The Rule of 78 deals with precomputed loans, that is, loans which have their finance charges calculated before the loan is made. The Rule of 78 is used to calculate the amount of the finance charge or interest to be rebated in the event that the loan is repaid early. The formula for unearned interest is:



Unearned interest = F x [k(k + 1) / n(n + 1)]



where F = total finance charge = n x M – P



M = regular monthly loan payment



P = original loan amount



k = remaining number of loan payments after current payment



n = original number of payments



For example, a borrower takes a $10,000 loan on a car to be repaid in 48 monthly installments of $310.00. However, she repays the loan after 36 months. The lender’s unearned interest can be calculated to be:



F = (48 x $310) - $10,000



F = $4,880



Unearned interest = $4,880 x [(12 x 13) / (48 x 49)]



Unearned interest = $4,880 x (156 / 2352)



Unearned interest = $4,880 x 0.0663



Unearned interest = $323.67
What Are Unearned Premiums?  

An unearned premium is the premium amount that corresponds to the time period remaining on an insurance policy. In other words, it is the portion of the policy premium that has not yet been "earned" by the insurance company because the policy still has some time before it expires.



Unearned premiums appear as a liability on the insurer's balance sheet because they would be paid back upon cancellation of the policy.



For example, at the end of the first year of a fully prepaid five-year insurance policy with insurance premiums of $2,000 per year, the insurer has earned a premium of $2,000 and has an unearned premium of $8,000.





Key Takeaways

Unearned premium is the portion of the policy premium that has not yet been "earned" by the insurance company because the policy still has some time before it expires. Provisions in the insurance contract govern the terms for unearned premium.In certain circumstances, an insurance company may not have to issue a refund for unearned premium.


   Understanding Unearned Premiums  

An unearned premium is the portion of an insurer's total premiums that is collected in advance by an insurance company. Unearned premiums may be subject to return if a client ends coverage before the term covered by the premium is complete. An unearned premium may be returned when an insured item is declared a total loss and coverage is no longer required, or when the insurance provider cancels the coverage.



For example, consider a client who paid an auto insurance premium one year in advance who experiences the complete destruction of his vehicle four months into the coverage period. The insurance company keeps one-third of the annual premium for coverage provided and returns the other two-thirds as unearned premium.



Provisions in the insurance contract govern the terms for unearned premium. The provisions must follow regulations related to the area where the coverage is offered. A specific formula for calculating the amount of the unearned premium may be required.



The premium that a policyholder pays for an insurance contract is not immediately recognized as earnings by the insurer. In certain circumstances, an insurance company may not have to issue a refund for unearned premium.



For example, if the policyholder has falsified information on the application for obtaining insurance coverage, the provider may not be required to refund any part of the earned or unearned premiums collected. Policies typically outline the conditions that must be met when applying for and receiving the unearned portion of a premium.



Insurance providers may not have to return a portion of unearned premium when a policyholder terminates the coverage for no given reason, or for reasons such as securing a similar policy with a different provider. It is best for the policyholder to wait until the coverage period of the last paid premium is close before switching insurance companies.



However, if the insured can prove the provider did not honor the terms and conditions described in the provisions of the policy, any unused portion of the premium should be refunded.


   Unearned Premium vs. Earned Premium  

An unearned premium on an insurance policy can be contrasted with earned premium. Earned premium is a pro-rated amount of paid-in-advance premiums that has been "earned" and now belongs to the insurer. The amount of the earned premium equates to the sum of the total premiums collected by an insurance company over a period of time. 



In other words, the earned premium is the portion of an insurance premium that paid for a portion of time in which the insurance policy was in effect, but has now passed and expired. Since the insurance company covered the risk during that time, it can now consider the associated premium payments it took from the insured as "earned."


   Example of Unearned Premium  

Because canceling a policy may mean issuing a refund, unearned premiums appear as liabilities on an insurance company’s balance sheet.



For example, an insurance company receives $600 on January 27 for coverage from February 1 to July 31, but as of January 31, the $600 has not been earned. The insurance company reports the $600 in its cash account and reports $600 as a current liability in its unearned premium revenue account. As the company earns the premium, the provider moves the amount earned from the liability account to a revenue account on its income statement.
What Is Unearned Revenue?  

Unearned revenue is money received by an individual or company for a service or product that has yet to be provided or delivered. It can be thought of as a "prepayment" for goods or services that a person or company is expected to supply to the purchaser at a later date. As a result of this prepayment, the seller has a liability equal to the revenue earned until the good or service is delivered. This liability is noted under current liabilities, as it is expected to be settled within a year.



Unearned revenue is also referred to as deferred revenue and advance payments.





Key Takeaways

Unearned revenue is money received by an individual or company for a service or product that has yet to be provided or delivered.It is recorded on a company’s balance sheet as a liability because it represents a debt owed to the customer.Once the product or service is delivered, unearned revenue becomes revenue on the income statement.Receiving funds early is beneficial to a company as it increases its cash flow that can be used for a variety of business functions.

   Understanding Unearned Revenue  

Unearned revenue is most common among companies selling subscription-based products or other services that require prepayments. Classic examples include rent payments made in advance, prepaid insurance, legal retainers, airline tickets, prepayment for newspaper subscriptions, and annual prepayment for the use of software.



Receiving money before a service is fulfilled can be beneficial. The early receipt of cash flow can be used for any number of activities, such as paying interest on debt and purchasing more inventory. 


   Recording Unearned Revenue  

Unearned revenue is recorded on a company’s balance sheet as a liability. It is treated as a liability because the revenue has still not been earned and represents products or services owed to a customer. As the prepaid service or product is gradually delivered over time, it is recognized as revenue on the income statement.



If a publishing company accepts $1,200 for a one-year subscription, the amount is recorded as an increase in cash and an increase in unearned revenue. Both are balance sheet accounts, so the transaction does not immediately affect the income statement. If it is a monthly publication, as each periodical is delivered, the liability or unearned revenue is reduced by $100 ($1,200 divided by 12 months) while revenue is increased by the same amount.



Unearned revenue is usually disclosed as a current liability on a company’s balance sheet. This changes if advance payments are made for services or goods due to be provided 12 months or more after the payment date. In such cases, the unearned revenue will appear as a long-term liability on the balance sheet.


   Unearned Revenue Reporting Requirements  

There are several criteria established by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that a public company must meet to recognize revenue. If these are not met, revenue recognition is deferred.



According to the SEC, there must be collection probability, or the ability to make a reasonable estimate of an amount for the allowance for doubtful accounts, completed delivery, or ownership shifted to the buyer, persuasive evidence of an arrangement, and a determined price.


   Example of Unearned Revenue  

Morningstar Inc. (MORN) offers a line of products and services for the financial industry, including financial advisors and asset managers. Many of its products are sold through subscriptions. Under this arrangement, many subscribers pay upfront and receive the product over time. This creates a situation in which the amount is recorded as unearned revenue or, as Morningstar calls it, deferred revenue.



At the end of the second quarter of 2020, Morningstar had $287 million in unearned revenue, up from $250 million from the prior-year end. The company classifies the revenue as a short-term liability, meaning it expects the amount to be paid over one year for services to be provided over the same period.

 Morningstar Quarterly Report



Unearned revenue can provide clues into future revenue, although investors should note the balance change could be due to a change in the business. Morningstar increased quarterly and monthly invoices but is less reliant on up-front payments from annual invoices, meaning the balance has been growing more slowly than in the past.
What is Uneconomic Growth  

Uneconomic growth is growth that produces negative externalities which reduce the overall quality of life. This is also known as unsustainable growth, where the negative social and environmental consequences outweigh the short-term value of an extra unit of growth, making it uneconomic.

Uneconomic growth happens when the marginal benefits of a growing economy are outweighed by the negative social and environmental consequences.Funds that invest based on an environmental, social, and governance (ESG) criteria aim to align their portfolios with the ideal that growth should be more sustainable.Some environmental advocates believe the impacts of uneconomic growth can only be addressed via lower rates of growth.


   Understanding Uneconomic Growth  

Uneconomic growth happens when the marginal benefits of manufacturing more goods and a growing economy are outweighed by the negative social and environmental impacts. It has become an article of faith in environmental and ecological economics—although the idea of unproductive growth has been around for a while.



Some of its philosophy has also been adopted by climate-change conscious investors in the environmental, social, and governance (ESG) space, where large wealth funds and foundations have been divesting themselves of fuel stocks. Socially conscious investors have been avoiding fossil fuel stocks and making other ethical investment decisions, in order to align the core of their investment strategy with their values.


   Greens Champion the Cause of Uneconomics  

The concept of uneconomic growth and the steady state economy was popularized by World Bank economist Herman Daly in the late 1990s. Ecologists, like environmental activist David Suzuki, argue that the global economy is now so large that society can no longer safely pretend it operates within a limitless ecosystem.



When one nation increases production by damaging the environment, it creates negative consequences that are felt by the entire planet, in terms of lost ecosystem services. The same principle can be applied to the level of a city, company or even one's own home.


   A Grim Prognosis for the Future of Global Economic Growth?  

Concerns about possible negative effects of growth on the environment and society have led environmentalists and climate activists to advocate lower levels of economic growth and fossil fuel use to limit the damage to the environment and climate. Ecological economists think the world has already passed the point when growth costs more than it is worth, and that we need to focus on protecting natural habitats.



The United Nations has adopted a progressive agenda to achieve "sustained economic growth." But even that does not go far enough for green economists who want to move "beyond growth" and find alternative global indicators to gross domestic product (GDP)—which because it is a monetary valuation does not distinguish between market transactions that contribute positively to sustainable well-being (such as buying bicycles, solar panels or fresh food) and those that diminish it (such as buying gas guzzlers, guns, or cigarettes).



The focus on GDP means that economic policies automatically have a pro-growth bias and that there is no distinction between economies that are undermining critical ecosystems and those that are not.
What Is Unemployment?  

The term unemployment refers to a situation where a person actively searches for employment but is unable to find work. Unemployment is considered to be a key measure of the health of the economy.



The most frequently used measure of unemployment is the unemployment rate. It's calculated by dividing the number of unemployed people by the number of people in the labor force.



Many governments offer unemployment insurance to certain unemployed individuals who meet eligibility requirements.





Key Takeaways

Unemployment occurs when workers who want to work are unable to find jobs.High rates of unemployment signal economic distress while extremely low rates of unemployment may signal an overheated economy.Unemployment can be classified as frictional, cyclical, structural, or institutional.Unemployment data is collected and published by government agencies in a variety of ways.Many governments offer unemployed individuals a small amount of income through unemployment insurance, as long as they meet certain requirements.

   How Unemployment Works  

Unemployment is a key economic indicator because it signals the ability (or inability) of workers to obtain gainful work and contribute to the productive output of the economy. More unemployed workers mean less total economic production.



The unemployment definition doesn't include people who leave the workforce for reasons such as retirement, higher education, and disability.


  Sign of Economic Distress  

Unemployed workers must maintain at least subsistence consumption during their period of unemployment. This means that an economy with high unemployment has lower output without a proportional decline in the need for basic consumption.



High, persistent unemployment can signal serious distress in an economy and even lead to social and political upheaval.


  Sign of an Overheating Economy  

A low unemployment rate, on the other hand, means that the economy is more likely to be producing near its full capacity, maximizing output, driving wage growth, and raising living standards over time.



However, extremely low unemployment can also be a cautionary sign of an overheating economy, inflationary pressures, and tight conditions for businesses in need of additional workers.


  Categories of Unemployment  

While the definition of unemployment is clear, economists divide unemployment into many different categories. The two broadest categories are voluntary and involuntary unemployment. When unemployment is voluntary, it means that a person left their job willingly in search of other employment. When it is involuntary, it means that a person was fired or laid off and must now look for another job.






   Types of Unemployment  

Both voluntary and involuntary unemployment can be broken down into four types.


  Frictional Unemployment  

This type of unemployment is usually short-lived. It is also the least problematic from an economic standpoint. It occurs when people voluntarily change jobs. After a person leaves a company, it naturally takes time to find another job. Similarly, graduates just starting to look for jobs to enter the workforce add to frictional unemployment.



Frictional unemployment is a natural result of the fact that market processes take time and information can be costly. Searching for a new job, recruiting new workers, and matching the right workers to the right jobs all take time and effort. This results in frictional unemployment.


  Cyclical Unemployment  

Cyclical unemployment is the variation in the number of unemployed workers over the course of economic upturns and downturns, such as those related to changes in oil prices. Unemployment rises during recessionary periods and declines during periods of economic growth.



Preventing and alleviating cyclical unemployment during recessions is one of the key reasons for the study of economics and the various policy tools that governments employ to stimulate the economy on the downside of business cycles.


  Structural Unemployment  

Structural unemployment comes about through a technological change in the structure of the economy in which labor markets operate. Technological changes can lead to unemployment among workers displaced from jobs that are no longer needed. Examples of such changes include the replacement of horse-drawn transport with automobiles and the automation of manufacturing.



Retraining these workers can be difficult, costly, and time-consuming. Displaced workers often end up either unemployed for extended periods or leaving the labor force entirely.


  Institutional Unemployment  

Institutional unemployment results from long-term or permanent institutional factors and incentives in the economy.



The following can all contribute to institutional unemployment:



Government policies, such as high minimum wage floors, generous social benefits programs, and restrictive occupational licensing laws
Labor market phenomena, such as efficiency wages and discriminatory hiring
Labor market institutions, such as high rates of unionization


   How to Measure Unemployment  

In the United States, the government uses surveys, census counts, and the number of unemployment insurance claims to track unemployment.



The U.S. Census conducts a monthly survey called the Current Population Survey (CPS) on behalf of the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) to produce the primary estimate of the nation’s unemployment rate. This survey has been done every month since 1940.



The sample consists of about 60,000 eligible households. That translates to about 110,000 people each month. The Census changes a quarter of the sampled households each month so that no household is represented for more than four consecutive months. This is meant to strengthen the reliability of the estimates.



Many variations of the unemployment rate exist, with different definitions of who is an unemployed person and who is in the labor force.



The BLS commonly cites the U-3 unemployment rate (defined as the total unemployed as a percentage of the civilian labor force) as the official unemployment rate; however, this definition does not include discouraged unemployed workers who are no longer looking for work.



Other categories of unemployment include discouraged workers and part-time or underemployed workers who want to work full-time but, for economic reasons, are unable to do so.


   History of Unemployment  

Although the U.S. government began tracking unemployment in the 1940s, the highest rate of unemployment to date occurred during the Great Depression, when unemployment rose to 24.9% in 1933.



Between 1931 and 1940, the unemployment rate remained above 14% but subsequently dropped down to the single digits. It remained there until 1982 when it climbed above 10%.



In 2009, during the Great Recession, unemployment again rose to 10%. In April 2020, amid the COVID-19 pandemic, unemployment hit 14.8%. As of Aug. 2023, the unemployment rate was 3.8%, a slight increase from the previous month's 3.5%.




What Are the Main Causes of Unemployment?
There are a number of reasons for unemployment. These include recessions, depressions, technological improvements, job outsourcing, and voluntarily leaving one job to find another.




What Are the Three Types of Unemployment?
Today's economists point to three main types of unemployment: frictional, structural, and cyclical. Frictional unemployment is the result of voluntary employment transitions within an economy. Frictional unemployment naturally occurs, even in a growing, stable economy as workers change jobs. Structural unemployment can produce permanent disruptions due to fundamental and permanent changes that occur in the structure of the economy. These changes can marginalize a group of workers. They include technological changes, a lack of relevant skills, and jobs moving overseas to another country. Cyclical unemployment relates to the loss of jobs that occurs during changes in business cycles.




What Is the Strict Definition of Unemployment?
The official unemployment definition comes from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, which states that "people are classified as unemployed if they do not have a job, have actively looked for work in the prior four weeks, and are currently available for work."


   The Bottom Line  

Unemployment is when an individual who is not employed and is seeking employment, cannot find work. Unemployment is a key indicator of the health of an economy. A low unemployment rate represents a strong economy while a high unemployment rate represents a weak economy.
What Is an Unemployment Claim?  

Unemployment claims are the requests for cash benefits made by an individual after they are laid off from their job. Claims are filed through state governments for temporary payments after people lose their jobs through no fault of their own.



The United States Department of Labor (DOL) tracks the number of weekly unemployment claims. It provides both seasonally adjusted and seasonally unadjusted claims numbers and also lists increases or decreases of 1,000 or more claims by state. This data is reported in the media as an indication of national and state economic health.





Key Takeaways


An unemployment claim is an application for cash benefits that an employee makes after being laid off or for other covered reasons.
Employees who lose a job through no fault of their own may qualify for benefits.
Unemployment insurance is paid by states, which collect funds from employers, while administrative costs are covered by the federal government.
Eligible individuals can receive up to 26 weeks of benefits, provided they file regular claims.



   Understanding Unemployment Claims  

Unemployment claims are paid from state funds that are collected from employers in the form of an unemployment insurance tax. Unemployment benefits are payable for a limited number of weeks and are designed to replace a percentage of a worker's previous wages. Most states provide up to 26 weeks of benefits for unemployed individuals.



Individuals are required to file unemployment claims with the UI program in the state where they worked. Claims may be filed in person, online, or over the phone depending on the state. When a claim is filed, the following information must be provided:



Social Security number (SSN)Contact informationDetails about the former employment



Workers must also meet certain criteria in order to be eligible for claims. They must be actual employees of the business, receiving W-2 forms at year-end—not independent contractors or freelancers. They must also have been laid off rather than having quit or been fired for misconduct.






You must demonstrate that you are actively looking for work in order to continue receiving your unemployment benefits.



The initial date of an unemployment claim determines the benefit year during which claimants may file weekly claims as well as the base period of the claim. The base period determines the wages used to compute the weekly and maximum benefit amounts and for which employers will have potential chargeback or reimbursement liability for any benefits paid to the claimant.



Only base period employers are part of an unemployment claim. Non-base period employers have no such liability.










   Filing a Claim  

The time you file an unemployment claim is very important. Consider, for example, an employer that hires an employee in March and lets that individual go after 30 days.



If the claimant files an initial claim before April 1, the base period would not include the first quarter of that year (the quarter in progress), nor the fourth quarter of the preceding year (the lag quarter).



It actually consists of the fourth quarter of the year before the year preceding the current year, and the first three quarters of the year preceding the current year; however, since the employer did not report wages during that base period, it will have no financial involvement in the claim.



The same applies if the claimant waited until April, May, or June to file the initial claim—in that case, the base period would omit the second quarter of the current year, the first quarter of the current year, and consist of the four quarters of the preceding year.



If the ex-employee files an initial claim after June 30 of the current year, then the employer could be a base period employer, but its chargeback liability would be limited due to having paid only 30 days' worth of wages.








What Is the Difference Between Jobless and Unemployed?
Jobless individuals are only reported as unemployed if they are actively seeking work. Jobless workers aren't included in the unemployment rate. The labor force is made up of the employed and unemployed—those who are neither employed or unemployed aren't counted as part of the labor force.




What Do Jobless Claims Mean?
Jobless claims are a measure of how many people are out of work at a certain time. There are two sections of jobless claims reported—initial and continuing jobless claims. Initial jobless claims are for new claimants for unemployment benefits while continuing jobless claims are for people who are continuing to receive benefits.




What Is the Current Unemployment Rate in the United States?
The unemployment rate in the United States is 3.8% as of Aug. 2023.


   The Bottom Line  

Unemployment claims are cash payments made to individuals after they have been laid off from their jobs. Unemployment claims help individuals cover expenses, such as rent, mortgages, and groceries, while they are unemployed and looking for work. Unemployment claims are not made to people who left their jobs voluntarily or to those who have been fired from their jobs.
What Is Unemployment Compensation?  

Unemployment compensation is paid by the state to unemployed workers who have lost their jobs due to layoffs or retrenchment. It is meant to provide a source of income for jobless workers until they can find employment. In order to be eligible for unemployment compensation, specific criteria must be satisfied, such as having worked for a minimum stipulated period and actively looking for a job.



Unemployment compensation, generally provided by an unemployment check or a direct deposit, provides partial income replacement for a defined length of time or until the worker finds employment, whichever comes first. It is also known as “unemployment benefits” or “unemployment insurance.”





Key Takeaways

Unemployment compensation is a benefit paid to people who have recently lost their job via no fault of their own, such as being laid off or if the business closed.Unemployment benefits are often calculated as a percentage of the average of the claimant’s pay over a recent 52-week period.Benefits connected to pandemic relief ended on Sept. 6, 2021.Compensation is usually paid by an unemployment check or via direct deposit.Every state sets its own requirements and rules surrounding its unemployment benefits.


   Understanding Unemployment Compensation  

Unemployment compensation is paid by many developed nations and some developing economies. In the United States, the unemployment compensation system is jointly managed by the federal government and each individual state government. Benefits are based on a percentage of a worker’s average pay over a recent 52-week period, and their calculation can vary by state.



Benefits are generally paid by state governments, funded in large part by state and federal payroll taxes paid by employers. Most states provide benefits for 26 weeks, though this varies by state and can go as low as 12 and as high as 30. Extensions are possible during periods of high unemployment.


   Unemployment Compensation Requirements  

As noted above, both the federal government and the individual states manage unemployment insurance in the United States.



Requirements vary by state in terms of how benefits are determined. To be eligible in New York, for example, you must have worked and been paid wages in two calendar quarters, been paid at least $2,600 in one calendar quarter, and the total wages paid to you must be at least 1.5 times the amount paid to you in your high quarter. The minimum benefit is $104 per week, and the maximum benefit is $504 per week.



New York and many other states waived the seven-day waiting period for benefits for people who are out of work due to coronavirus (COVID-19) closures or quarantines.


   COVID-19-Related Unemployment Programs  

On March 27, 2020, President Trump signed into law a $2 trillion coronavirus emergency stimulus package called the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act. It temporarily expanded unemployment insurance benefits through three initiatives:



The Pandemic Unemployment Assistance program
The Federal Pandemic Unemployment Compensation program
The Pandemic Emergency Unemployment Compensation program



Here is a quick summary of how they compare:









PROGRAM
WHAT IT DOES




Pandemic Unemployment Assistance (PUA)
Extended benefits to the self-employed, freelancers, and independent contractors. Ended on Sept. 6, 2021.


Federal Pandemic Unemployment Compensation (FPUC)
Provided a federal benefit of $600 a week up until July 25, 2020. The benefit is extended but reduced to $300 per week until March 14, 2021, beginning Jan. 2, 2021. Ended on Sept. 6, 2021.


Pandemic Emergency Unemployment Compensation (PEUC)
Extended benefits for an extra 13 weeks after regular unemployment compensation benefits are exhausted with an additional 11 weeks having been added for a total of 24 weeks. Ended on Sept. 6, 2021.






President Joe Biden signed the American Rescue Plan, a stimulus package worth $1.9 trillion on March 11, 2021, which provided additional benefits to Americans because of the COVID-19 pandemic. The bill extended unemployment benefits for those who lost their jobs because of the pandemic from March 14, 2021, to Sept. 6, 2021. The new law extended the PUA by an additional 29 weeks from 50 to 79 weeks. It also pushed PEUC benefits from a total of 24 to 53 weeks.



All unemployment benefits and compensation related to the pandemic ended on Sept. 6, 2021.


   History of Unemployment Compensation  

The first unemployment compensation system was introduced in the United Kingdom with the National Insurance Act of 1911 under the Liberal Party government of H.H. Asquith. The measures were intended to counteract the increasing footprint of the Labour Party among the country’s working-class population.



The National Insurance Act gave the British working classes a contributory system of insurance against illness and unemployment; however, it only applied to wage earners. The families of wage earners and those earning non-wage income had to rely on other sources of support. Communists—who thought such insurance would prevent workers from starting a revolution—criticized the benefit, but employers and Tories saw it as a “necessary evil.”



The British unemployment compensation scheme was based on actuarial principles, and it was funded by a fixed amount contributed by workers, employers, and taxpayers. After one week of unemployment, the worker was eligible to receive seven shillings per week for up to 15 weeks in a year. However, the benefits were restricted to particular industries that tended to have more volatile employment requirements, such as shipbuilding, and it did not make provision for any dependents. By 1913, about 2.5 million people were insured under the British scheme for unemployment benefits.



In the United States, unemployment compensation began at the state level when Wisconsin enacted it in 1932 to assuage the effect of the Great Depression. In 1935, President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed the Social Security Act and established it nationwide. Initially, employers of fewer than eight employees were exempt from having the coverage. That number dropped to four in 1954 and was reduced to one in 1970.


   Special Considerations  

The system is called Employment Insurance (EI) in Canada and is funded by premiums paid by both employers and employees. Canada’s first national unemployment system was established in 1940 by the Unemployment Insurance Act, also prompted by the effects of the Great Depression.



The law was expanded and liberalized in 1971 and finally replaced in 1996 by the Employment Insurance Act, which changed the program’s name to emphasize that it intends to promote employment rather than support unemployment.
What Are the Unemployment Compensation Amendments of 1992?  

The Unemployment Compensation Amendments of 1992 are laws in the United States that allow an employee who loses their job to roll over their employer-sponsored retirement savings into a qualified retirement plan, such as an individual retirement account (IRA), without tax consequences. The provision allowing former employees to do this was included among other amendments to the Emergency Unemployment Compensation Act of 1991, which at the time extended emergency unemployment benefits.





Key Takeaways

The Unemployment Compensation Amendments of 1992 are laws that allow an employee who loses their job to roll over their employer-sponsored retirement savings into an individual retirement account (IRA) or other qualified retirement plan, without tax consequences.Employers must give employees the option of a direct transfer to the new account.Because direct transfers do not count as a distribution, the amount transferred is not considered taxable income.Employees who choose to receive the funds directly, not as a direct transfer, are subject to a mandatory 20% withholding tax on the withdrawal amount.


   Understanding the Unemployment Compensation Amendments of 1992  

Under the Unemployment Compensation Amendments of 1992, if you lose your job, then your employer is required to provide you with the option of rolling over your retirement savings in a company-sponsored plan, such as a 401(k), to an IRA or other qualified retirement plan account that you choose.



The law allows employees the option of trustee-to-trustee transfers. In a trustee-to-trustee transfer, also called a direct transfer, the funds are not paid directly to the account holder, nor does the account holder receive a check made payable to the new account. Instead, the two financial institutions facilitate the transfer on your behalf.



With a trustee-to-trustee transfer, no taxes are withheld from the amount that is transferred. Also, the transfer does not count as a distribution, which means that the amount is not considered taxable income.



If you choose to receive the funds in a check, then there is a mandatory withholding of 20% of the withdrawal amount that is paid to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to cover federal income tax, regardless of how much you may ultimately end up owing. For example, if you effectively only owe 12% at tax time, this means you’ll have to wait until you file your taxes to get that 8% back.






If you lose your job, then withdrawing funds from your employer’s retirement plan as a lump sum before you are at least age 59½ should be a last resort. In addition to tax penalties, you will lose part of your nest egg and diminish its power to accrue earnings on a tax-deferred basis. This could put you significantly behind in saving for retirement.


   Special Considerations  

Most 401(k) plan rules state that if you have less than $1,000 in your account, then an employer is automatically allowed to cash it out and give the funds to you directly. In general, if you have $1,000 to $5,000, then your employer will put it in an IRA if you don’t tell them what to do with the funds.



Some employers allow you to leave your retirement savings in the company’s plan even after you have left if you meet a minimum balance requirement—typically more than $5,000 in your account. But keep in mind that if you leave your account with your old employer, then you will no longer be able to contribute to it.



If you choose to move your retirement savings to an IRA, then you will have a wider range of investment choices than with the employer’s plan. Typically, 401(k)s offer several mutual funds, ranging from conservative to aggressive, from which an employee can choose. With an IRA, most types of investments are available.
What Is Unemployment Income?  

Unemployment income refers to an insurance benefit paid due to taxpayers' inability to find gainful employment. Unemployment income is paid from either a federal or state-sponsored fund. The recipient must meet certain criteria in trying to find a job. Employers and employees are assessed a payroll tax to cover the cost of this benefit.



Unemployment income is also known as an unemployment benefit, unemployment compensation, or unemployment insurance. The term is most commonly associated with filing a tax return, where such income must be reported.





Key Takeaways

Unemployment income is paid by the government temporarily to unemployed workers who have lost their jobs due to layoffs or other reasons not of their own fault.The goal of unemployment income is to provide a social safety net to those individuals who have become unemployed while looking for a new job.Typically, unemployment is treated as ordinary income for tax purposes and must be reported to the IRS.Under normal circumstances, most states pay a maximum of 26 weeks of unemployment benefits, but benefits can be extended or augmented during an economic crisis.If you quit your job, you must have a reasonable cause, or you will most likely not qualify for unemployment.


   Understanding Unemployment Income  

Unemployment benefits were first introduced in 1935 along with Social Security. Unemployment income is designed to provide a subsistence income for a given length of time, giving the unemployed recipient time to find another job.



In the United States, unemployment income is paid to jobless individuals who qualify for them. Individuals must have worked at least one quarter in the previous year and been laid off by their employer. They must be actively seeking work to claim and receive benefits. Temporary workers or those who worked off the books are not eligible, nor are individuals who quit their jobs or were fired for misconduct.



Claims may be denied for several reasons, including if:



The worker quit their job without a reasonable cause, such as medical reasons or to care for a family memberThe worker is not available for work (meaning nothing is preventing the individual from accepting a new job)The worker was terminated for misconductThe worker refused suitable workThe unemployment was the result of a labor dispute



Unemployment income is fully taxable as ordinary income. Recipients are sent a Form 1099-G at year-end detailing how much they received, which they must report on their 1040 form.


   Unemployment Income Amounts  

Individual states determine how much unemployment income an individual receives every week, a figure that may vary significantly from state to state.



For example, Minnesota had one of the highest maximum weekly benefit amounts at $762, topped only by Massachusetts at $855. Massachusetts allows up to 30 weeks of payments while Minnesota offers a maximum of 26 weeks. Though not the lowest, Florida's $375 maximum weekly benefit and 14 weeks of benefits are among the least generous.



During high unemployment, such as during the Great Recession, unemployment income payments may last for 99 weeks. During times of low unemployment, such benefits tend to last for up to roughly six months or 26 weeks in most states, though some states may offer a fraction of that.


   The COVID-19 Pandemic and Unemployment Income  

On March 27, 2020, President Donald Trump signed into law a $2 trillion coronavirus emergency stimulus package called the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act, which put provisions in place to provide unemployment benefits to unemployed individuals affected by the pandemic.



The law also expanded eligibility to allow those who otherwise don't qualify for benefits, including self-employed people, freelancers, and independent contractors, and created three initiatives called the Pandemic Unemployment Assistance (PUA) program, the Federal Pandemic Unemployment (FPUC) program, and the Pandemic Emergency Unemployment Compensation (PEUC) program.



On Sept. 6, 2021, all of these special pandemic-related benefits came to an end.






While the American Rescue Plan extended the deadline for federal pandemic unemployment relief to Sept. 6, 2021, a number of states elected to end their enrollment in the FPUC and PEUC programs early. The best way to confirm the status and duration of your unemployment benefits is to check with your state's unemployment office.


  Pandemic Unemployment Assistance (PUA)  

As mentioned above, unemployment benefits were expanded under the PUA to include people who normally don't qualify for this type of income. These benefits are based on someone's previous earnings, according to a formula by the Disaster Unemployment Assistance program.



The minimum benefit provided was 50% of an individual state's average benefit per week, approximately $190 for that period.


  Federal Pandemic Unemployment Compensation (FPUC)  

The CARES Act also established the FPUC program, which provided unemployed individuals with an extra benefit of $600. This benefit was paid weekly in addition to other unemployment income until July 2020.



This benefit was extended after the passage of the Consolidated Appropriations Act (CAA) of 2021 in December 2020. The amount was then reduced to $300, payable every week beginning Dec. 26, 2020, until March 14, 2021. President Joe Biden pushed down the expiration date after signing the $1.9 trillion package called the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 on March 11, 2021. According to the new law, unemployed individuals could receive the additional $300 weekly benefit until Sept. 6, 2021.


  Pandemic Emergency Unemployment Compensation (PEUC)   

States typically provide people with 26 weeks of unemployment benefits. But the CARES Act expanded that timeline under the PEUC, allowing individuals to claim benefits for an additional 13 weeks. But the law stated that people must be "able to work, available to work, and actively seeking work."



These benefits were extended to 24 weeks with the passage of the CAA in December 2020. The Biden Administration changed that again in March 2021 to 53 weeks, and the PEUC expired on Sept. 6, 2021.
What Is Unemployment Insurance (UI)?  

Unemployment insurance (UI), also called unemployment benefits, is a type of state-provided insurance that pays money to individuals on a weekly basis when they lose their job and meet certain eligibility requirements.



Those who either voluntarily quit or were fired for a just cause are usually not eligible for UI. In other words, someone separated from their job due to a lack of available work and at no fault of their own usually qualifies for unemployment benefits.



Each state administers its own unemployment insurance program, despite it being federal law. Workers must meet their state's work and wage requirements, including time worked. The benefits are primarily paid out by state governments and funded by specific payroll taxes collected for that purpose.





Key Takeaways

Unemployment insurance is a state-run program that provides individuals with weekly payments when they lose their jobs and meet certain eligibility requirements.Benefits under unemployment insurance, also called unemployment compensation, typically last up to 26 weeks, depending on the state in which you live and have worked.You do not qualify for unemployment insurance if you quit your job or are fired for cause.The U.S. Department of Labor oversees the unemployment insurance program.Three programs established by the 2020 CARES Act were designed to help out-of-work Americans during the Covid pandemic, including those who ordinarily would be ineligible to access unemployment funds, though those programs expired Sept. 6, 2021.


   Understanding Unemployment Insurance (UI)  

The unemployment initiative is a joint program between individual state governments and the federal government. Unemployment insurance provides cash stipends to unemployed workers who actively seek employment. Compensation to eligible, unemployed workers is made through the Federal Unemployment Tax Act (FUTA) along with state employment agencies.



Each state has an unemployment insurance program, but all states must follow specific guidelines outlined by federal law. Federal law makes unemployment benefits relatively ubiquitous across state lines. The U.S. Department of Labor oversees the program and ensures compliance within each state.



Workers who meet specific eligibility requirements may receive up to 26 weeks of benefits a year. The weekly cash stipend is designed to replace a percentage of the employee's regular wage, on average. States fund unemployment insurance using taxes levied on employers. The majority of employers will pay both federal and state unemployment FUTA tax. Companies that have 501(c)3 status do not pay FUTA tax.






Continuing claims for unemployment insurance reached about 1.68 million during the week ending Aug. 26, 2023. The four-week moving average for continuing claims was reported at roughly 1.70 million.



Three states also require minimal employee contributions to the state unemployment fund. Reportable income includes freelance work or jobs for which unemployment insurance recipients were paid in cash.



Out-of-work persons who do not find employment after a 26-week period may be eligible for an extended benefits program. Extended benefits give unemployed workers an additional number of weeks of unemployment benefits. The availability of extended benefits will depend on a state's overall unemployment situation.



The federal government established provisions designed to help unemployed Americans during the coronavirus pandemic. These additional benefits were put in place after former President Donald Trump signed the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act in March 2020.



They were extended after the passing of the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021 and were extended again when President Joe Biden signed the $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 on March 11, 2021. The additional benefits expired on Sept. 6, 2021.


   Requirements for Unemployment Insurance (UI)  

An unemployed person must meet two primary requirements to qualify for unemployment insurance benefits. An unemployed individual must meet state-mandated thresholds for either earned wages or time worked in a stated base period. The state must also determine that the eligible person is unemployed through no fault of their own. A person may file an unemployment insurance claim when fulfilling these two requirements.



Individuals file claims in the state where they worked. A participant may file claims by phone or on the state unemployment insurance agency's website. After the first application, it generally takes two to three weeks for the processing and approval of a claim.



After approval of a claim, the participant must either file weekly or biweekly reports that test or confirm their employment situation. Reports must be submitted to remain eligible for benefit payments. An unemployed worker cannot refuse work during a week, and on each weekly or biweekly claim, they must report any income that they earned from freelance or consulting gigs.


   How Is Unemployment Insurance (UI) Funded?  

Unemployment insurance is funded by taxes on employers, such as the FUTA and various state taxes. FUTA charges 6% of the first $7,000 of each employee's wages, although this is offset by a 5.4% credit for on-time tax payments.



Some states pay for unemployment benefits by debiting the former employer's UI account, or by raising the employer's UI taxes in future years. Since employees are usually not eligible for UI if they quit voluntarily, some employers may pressure their employees to resign rather than fire them.


   Unemployment Insurance (UI) During the Pandemic  

On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19, the illness caused by a novel coronavirus, to be a pandemic. States and businesses across the U.S. closed down, causing massive unemployment.



Lawmakers agreed on the passage of the CARES Act, a landmark piece of legislation that, in part, expanded states' ability to provide UI to millions of workers affected by COVID-19, including people who aren't ordinarily eligible for unemployment benefits. The bill was passed and signed into law in March 2020.



Three specific programs were designed to help Americans who were out of work because of the coronavirus. A fourth program was established through an Aug. 8, 2020 memorandum issued by President Trump in response to the expiration of the Federal Pandemic Employment Compensation program.






While people who voluntarily quit their jobs do not normally qualify for UI, you may qualify for benefits if you quit due to unpaid wages, unsafe working conditions, a sudden decrease in your hours, or certain other factors. The legal term for this is constructive dismissal.


  Federal Pandemic Unemployment Compensation (FPUC)  

The Federal Pandemic Unemployment Compensation (FPUC) provided an extra weekly benefit on top of regular UI. The original benefit provided an additional $600 weekly under the CARES Act, but that benefit expired on July 31, 2020. The FPUC was modified and extended as part of the Consolidated Appropriations Act in Dec. 2020.



Another extension of the FPUC was approved after President Joe Biden signed the $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 on March 11, 2021. Under the plan, FPUC benefits expired on Sept. 6, 2021.


  Pandemic Unemployment Assistance (PUA)  

The Pandemic Unemployment Assistance (PUA) expanded UI eligibility to self-employed workers, freelancers, independent contractors, and part-time workers impacted by the coronavirus pandemic. Self-employed workers generally may not qualify for UI, and the PUA provided them with financial assistance. As per the American Rescue Plan Act, the PUA expired on Sept. 6, 2021, after a total of 79 weeks.


  Pandemic Emergency Unemployment Compensation (PEUC)  

The Pandemic Emergency Unemployment Compensation (PEUC) extended UI benefits under the CARES Act after regular unemployment compensation benefits were exhausted. The PEUC program officially expired in Sept. 6, 2021.


  Lost Wages Assistance (LWA) Program  

The Lost Wages Assistance (LWA) program was a federal-state unemployment benefit that provided $300 to $400 in weekly compensation to eligible claimants. LWA came into existence in response to the expiration of FPUC on July 31, 2020.




What Are the 4 Types of Unemployment?
The four types of unemployment are cyclical, frictional, institutional, and structural unemployment.Cyclical unemployment is caused by changes in the business cycle, such as recessions.Frictional unemployment occurs when workers leave their jobs and take some time to find a new employer.Institutional unemployment occurs as a result of policies that alter the features of the labor market, such as minimum wage laws and unemployment insurance.Structural employment is long-term unemployment caused by deep changes in the economy, such as new technologies or changing business needs.




How Is Unemployment Calculated?
In the United States, the unemployment rate is calculated by dividing the number of unemployed people who are actively looking for work by the total number of people who are employed or actively seeking employment. This does not include unemployed people who are unable to work or have given up seeking employment.




Who Is Counted As Unemployed?
The unemployed include anyone that doesn't have a job, is available for work, and has been actively looking for work in the previous four weeks. Actively looking for work includes having job interviews or contacting employers.




What Is the Meaning of UI?
UI, or unemployment insurance, is a government benefit for those who lose their jobs through no fault of their own. UI provides a temporary safety net so that people can continue searching for jobs after they are fired or laid off. Notably, employees who voluntarily quit or are fired for absenteeism or insubordination do not normally qualify for UI, and those who leave due to intolerable working conditions may qualify even if they did quit.


   The Bottom Line  

Unemployment insurance is a form of state-provided insurance that provides weekly payments to people who have recently been fired or laid off. Although it only provides a fraction of a full paycheck, UI payments can help workers make ends meet as they search for a new job.
What Is the Unemployment Rate?  

The unemployment rate is the percentage of the labor force without a job. It is a lagging indicator, meaning that it generally rises or falls in the wake of changing economic conditions, rather than anticipating them. When the economy is in poor shape and jobs are scarce, the unemployment rate can be expected to rise. When the economy grows at a healthy rate and jobs are relatively plentiful, it can be expected to fall.





Key Takeaways

The unemployment rate is the proportion of the labor force that is not currently employed but could be.There are six different ways the unemployment rate is calculated by the Bureau of Labor Statistics using different criteria.The most comprehensive statistic reported is called the U-6 rate, but the most widely used and cited is the U-3 rate.The U-3 unemployment rate for August 2023 was 3.8%.U.S. unemployment data is released on the first Friday of every month.






   Understanding the Unemployment Rate  

The U.S. unemployment rate is released on the first Friday of every month (with a few exceptions) for the preceding month. The current and past editions of the report are available on the website of the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). Users can generate and download tables showing any of the labor market measures named above for a specified date range.



In the U.S., the official and the most commonly cited national unemployment rate is the U-3, which the BLS releases as part of its monthly employment situation report. It defines unemployed people as those who are willing and available to work and who have actively sought work within the past four weeks.



According to the BLS, those with temporary, part-time, or full-time jobs are considered employed, as are those who perform at least 15 hours of unpaid work for a family business or farm. The unemployment rate is seasonally adjusted to account for predictable variations, such as extra hiring during the holidays. The BLS also provides the unadjusted rate.






The national unemployment rate for August 2023 increased from the previous month to 3.8%.


  U-3 vs. U-6 Unemployment  

The U-3 is not the only metric available, and it measures unemployment fairly narrowly. The more comprehensive U-6 rate, which is often called the real unemployment rate, is an alternative measure of unemployment that includes groups such as discouraged workers who stopped looking for a new job and the underemployed who work part-time because they can't find full-time employment. The seasonally adjusted U-6 real unemployment rate for August 2023 was 7.1%, which is slightly higher than the 6.7% rate reported in July 2023.
To calculate the U-3 unemployment rate, the number of unemployed people is divided by the number of people in the labor force, which consists of all employed and unemployed people. The ratio is expressed as a percentage. The August 2023 seasonally adjusted U-3 unemployment rate as reported by the BLS was 3.8%.

Unemployment Rate (seasonally adjusted)



Many people who want to work but cannot (due to a disability, for example) or became discouraged after looking for work without success, are not considered unemployed under this definition; since they are not employed either, they are categorized as outside the labor force.



Critics see this approach as painting an unjustifiably rosy picture of the labor force. U-3 is also criticized for making no distinction between those in temporary, part-time, and full-time jobs, even in cases where part-time or temporary workers would rather work full-time but cannot due to labor market conditions.





Unadjusted


   How the Unemployment Rate Affects the Economy  

Unemployment is one of the most closely-watched indicators for economic health, along with gross domestic product (GDP) and the consumer price index (CPI). The unemployment rate has an inverse relationship with the stock market and inflation, two key metrics for the overall health of the economy.



A low unemployment rate tends to be associated with an increased average wage, due to the reduced labor supply. In some instances, this can result in inflation, as employers raise prices to account for increased labor costs. Low unemployment also tends to be accompanied by increased stock prices, because the workforce has more disposable income.


   Alternative Measures of Unemployment  

In response to concerns that the official rate does not fully convey the health of the labor market, the BLS publishes five alternative measures: U-1, U-2, U-4, U-5, and U-6. Though these are often referred to as unemployment rates (U-6, in particular, is often called the real unemployment rate), U-3 is technically the only official unemployment rate. The others are measures of "labor underutilization." 


  U-1

​U-4=Labor Force+Discouraged WorkersUnemployed+Discouraged Workers​×100​

Discouraged workers are those who are available to work and would like a job, but gave up actively looking for one. This category includes people who feel they lack the necessary qualifications or education, who believe there is no work available in their field, or who feel they are too young or old to find work.
Those who feel unable to find work due to discrimination also fall under this category. Note that the denominator—normally the labor force—is adjusted to include discouraged workers, who are not technically part of the labor force.


  U-5  

Unemployed people, plus those marginally attached to the labor force, as a percentage of the labor force (plus the marginally attached).

​U-5=Labor Force+Marginally AttachedUnemployed+Marginally Attached​×100​

People marginally attached to the labor force include discouraged workers and anyone else who would like a job and has looked for one in the past 12 months but actively gave up searching. As with U-4, the denominator is expanded to include the marginally attached, who are not technically part of the labor force.

This metric is the BLS's most comprehensive. In addition to the categories included in U-5, it accounts for people who have been forced to settle for part-time work even though they want to work full-time. This category is often referred to as underemployed, although that label arguably includes full-time workers who are overqualified for their jobs. The denominator for this ratio is the same as in U-5.





Unemployment Rates (seasonally adjusted)


   Collection of Unemployment Data  

Official U.S. employment statistics are produced by the BLS, an agency within the Department of Labor (DOL). Every month the Census Bureau, part of the Department of Commerce (DOC), conducts the Current Population Survey (CPS) using a sample of approximately 60,000 households, or about 110,000 individuals.



The survey collects data on individuals in these households by race, ethnicity, age, veteran status, and gender (but only allowing for categories of men or women), all of which—along with geography—add nuance to the employment data. The sample is rotated so that 75% of the households remain constant from month to month and 50% from year to year. Interviews are conducted in person or by phone.







The survey excludes individuals under the age of 16 and those who are in the Armed Forces (hence references to the civilian labor force). People in correctional facilities, mental health care facilities, and similar institutions are also excluded. Interviewers ask a series of questions that determine employment status but do not ask whether respondents are employed or unemployed. Nor do the interviewers themselves assign employment status; they record the answers for the BLS to analyze.



Interviewers also collect information on industries, occupations, average earnings, and union membership. For those who are jobless, interviewers also ask whether they quit or were discharged (fired or laid off).






   Unemployment Rate and COVID-19  

In response to pandemic-related closures or business cutbacks, unemployment in the United States achieved historic records. In May 2020, 49.8 million individuals reported they had been unable to work at some point in the prior four weeks because their employer closed or lost business due to the pandemic. The unemployment rate increased from 4.4% in March 2020 to 14.8% in April 2020, achieving levels not seen since the 1930s.



The impacts of COVID-19 were experienced across the nation, as every state in the United States experienced a higher unemployment rate than what was recorded during the Great Recession; however, unemployment rates disproportionately impacted different sectors:



Financial Activities: The unemployment rate in May 2020 was 5.7%, while the unemployment rate in July 2021 improved to 3.0%.Leisure and Hospitality: The unemployment rate in April 2020 was 39.3%, while the unemployment rate in July 2021 improved to 9.0%.Wholesale and Retail: The unemployment rate in April 2020 was 17.1%, while the unemployment rate in July 2021 improved to 6.0%.




What Is the Current U.S. Unemployment Rate?
As of August 2023, the U-3 unemployment rate in the United States was recorded at 3.8%, just below the pre-pandemic unemployment rate.




What Is a Healthy Unemployment Rate?
Low unemployment is not considered healthy, as lower rates can be seen as inflationary due to pricing pressure on salaries; however, high unemployment is not considered healthy, as higher rates can be seen as a financial strain on consumer spending. In general, most experts deem unemployment between 3% and 5% to be ideal, though there is no single consensus on what constitutes healthy unemployment.




What Are the Other Measures of U.S. Unemployment?
American unemployment rates utilize five measures in addition to the headline H3 figures: U-1, U-2, U-4, U-5, and U-6. Each of these incrementally considers additional groups of individuals and labels them as unemployed (e.g., those underemployed or working part-time but seeking full employment, etc.) The U-6 number is sometimes referred to as the real unemployment rate since it is the most comprehensive.




What's the Difference Between U-3 and U-6 Unemployment Rates?
U-3 is the headline unemployment number that we see in the news. It looks at those out-of-work Americans who have been looking for a job within the past four weeks. The more comprehensive U-6 includes everyone in U-3 plus those with only temporary work and people who are considered marginally attached to the labor force. These include those who have stopped looking for a job, as well as part-time workers unable to work full-time for economic reasons.




How Is U.S. Unemployment Data Collected?
The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, or BLS, surveys approximately 60,000 households in person or over the phone. The responses are later aggregated by race, ethnicity, age, veteran status, and gender, all of which—along with geography—add greater detail to the employment picture.


   The Bottom Line  

In assessing an economy's health, the nation's unemployment rate plays a major factor in setting monetary policy and making strategic economic decisions. Though there are various ways to calculate unemployment, the general public is most familiar with the U-3 rate. The calculation for this iteration of the unemployment rate is to divide the number of unemployed individuals by the total workforce.
What Is Unencumbered?  

Unencumbered refers to an asset or property that is free and clear of any encumbrances, such as creditor claims or liens. An unencumbered asset is much easier to sell or transfer than one with an encumbrance. Examples of common unencumbered assets are houses free from mortgages and other liens, cars with paid off loans/notes, or stocks purchased in a cash account.


   Understanding Unencumbered  

Creditors do not have claims to unencumbered assets as there are no associated debts. As a result, these assets are the full property of the person(s) listed as the owner(s) in an official capacity, such as on a title or deed. Unencumbered assets are not listed as collateral for any debt and are not subject to competing claims, such as past-due property taxes.



For the majority of consumers, especially young couples and recent graduates, high-value assets, such as real estate and cars, are unlikely to be unencumbered. This is because these purchases are often financed, leading to the acquisition of debt, with the asset as collateral. Over time, as the mortgage or car loan is paid off, these assets become unencumbered. A title search is a key part of the due diligence process for a buyer of real estate or a used car to confirm that the asset is unencumbered or has outstanding liens.





Key Takeaways

Unencumbered refers to assets or property without encumbrances, interests by other parties.Creditors have no interest in unencumbered assets as they are free and clear of debts and liens.Unencumbered assets are often easier to transfer than encumbered assets because only the seller and buyer must approve the transaction.In bankruptcy, the value of liquidated unencumbered assets is distributed to creditors.


   Encumbered vs. Unencumbered Assets  

Unencumbered assets are easier to transfer because only the property owner, acting as the seller, and the party interested in purchasing the property, acting as the buyer must approve the sale. Further, there will be no predetermined required sale price, allowing the seller to set the price at his or her discretion.



Encumbered assets can be sold, but the sale process requires approval by the buyer and seller, as well as any other entity that has a claim to the asset, such as the bank that issued the loan for the collateralized asset. This can lead to minimum sales price requirements, often in an amount equal to or above the collateralized debt amount against the subject property. This allows the debt to be effectively paid off as part of the sales transaction.


   Special Considerations  

In most bankruptcy proceedings involving liquidations, encumbered assets are first considered the property of those holding rights to the property through the encumbrance, allowing the institution to recoup some of the losses through the acquisition, and a possible later sale, of the assets in question.



In some cases, unencumbered assets do not have a predetermined owner if the assets are liquidated in bankruptcy. This allows the value of any liquidated unencumbered assets to be distributed to creditors who extended unsecured credit.



In certain circumstances, the IRS, state, or even local taxing authorities can place a lien on previously unencumbered property to collect past due taxes.
What Is Unfair Claims Practice?  

Unfair claims practice is the improper avoidance of a claim by an insurer or an attempt to reduce the size of the claim. By engaging in unfair claims practices, an insurer tries to reduce its costs. However, this is illegal in many jurisdictions.





Key Takeaways

An unfair claims practice is what happens when an insurer tries to delay, avoid, or reduce the size of a claim that is due to be paid out to an insured party.Insurers that do this are trying to reduce costs or delay payments to insured parties, and are often engaging in practices that are illegal.Many states have passed unfair claims practices laws to protect insured parties from bad behavior on the part of insurers in the claims settlement process.Unfair Claims Settlement Practices Acts (UCSPA) are enforced by individual states, rather than the federal government, and vary state-by-state.


   Understanding Unfair Claims Practice  

The National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) has created a model of unfair claims practice legislation that mandates claims be handled fairly and that there be clear communication between the insurer and the insured. States, not the federal government, regulate insurance; many jurisdictions have implemented unfair claims practices laws modeled after the NAIC's model act. 



Also, most states have enacted a version of this model law. Called the Unfair Claims Settlement Practices Act, it protects insurance buyers from unjust behavior by insurers in the claims settlement process. Specifics of the law vary from state to state. Unfair Claims Settlement Practices Acts (UCSPA) are not federal law; instead, they are enforced by individual state insurance departments.


   Example of Unfair Claims Practice  

Consider a small business owner that insures his company's building and business personal property under a commercial property policy. Unfortunately, a fire broke out in the building, causing $100,000 in property damage. The insurance company delays payment, rendering the business owner unable to repair any of the damage. The insurance company continues using delay tactics to avoid making a payment. For example, the claims representative keeps "forgetting" to send the claim forms. Also, the adjuster says he needs another proof of loss, but the small business owner has already submitted proof of loss twice. These are the types of situations that unfair claims practice laws are designed to prevent.


   Other Examples of Unfair Claims Practice  

Misrepresenting relevant facts or policy provisions. For instance, your commercial property policy states that Building Ordinance coverage is included, but your insurer insists the coverage is excluded.Making a significant alteration in an application without your consent and then settling a claim based on the alteration. For instance, in your application, you requested a $50,000 limit for Utility Interruption coverage, but your insurer reduced the limit to $10,000 without telling you. The insurer then refuses to pay more than $10,000 for a loss.Settling claims for less than what you would reasonably expect based on a written advertisement you received. For instance, an ad announces a $50,000 limit for damage caused by flooding. However, the ad doesn't mention anywhere that this coverage is provided only if the insured pays an additional premium beyond the premium stated in the ad.
What Is an Unfair Trade Practice?  

Unfair trade practices refer to the use of various deceptive, fraudulent, or unethical methods to obtain business. Unfair business practices include misrepresentation, false advertising or representation of a good or service, tied selling, false free prize or gift offers, deceptive pricing, and noncompliance with manufacturing standards. Such acts are considered unlawful by statute through the Consumer Protection Law, which opens up recourse for consumers by way of compensatory or punitive damages. An unfair trade practice is sometimes referred to as “deceptive trade practices” or “unfair business practices.”





Key Takeaways

Unfair trade practices refer to businesses using deceptive, fraudulent, or otherwise unethical methods to gain an advantage or turn a profit.Consumer Protection Law, as well as Section 5(a) of the Federal Trade Commission Act, protects consumers from unfair business practices.


   Understanding Unfair Trade Practices  

Unfair trade practices are commonly seen in the purchase of goods and services by consumers, tenancy, insurance claims and settlements, and debt collection. Most states’ unfair trade practices statutes were originally enacted between the 1960s and 1970s. Since then, many states have adopted these laws to prevent unfair trade practices. Consumers who have been victimized should examine the unfair trade practice statute in their state to determine whether they have a cause of action.






Unfair trade practices are commonly seen in the purchase of goods and services by consumers, tenancy, insurance claims and settlements, and debt collection.



In the United States, unfair trade practices are addressed in Section 5(a) of the Federal Trade Commission Act, which prohibits “unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce.” It applies to all individuals engaged in commerce, including banks, and sets the legal standard for unfair trade practices, which may be deemed unfair, deceptive, or both. Below are lists of unfair and deceptive practices as per the rule:


   Unfair Practices  

An act is unfair when it meets the following criteria:



It causes or is likely to cause substantial injury to consumers.It cannot be reasonably avoided by consumers.It is not outweighed by countervailing benefits to consumers or to the competition.


   Deceptive Practices  

An act or practice is deceptive when it meets the following criteria:



A representation, omission, or practice misleads or is likely to mislead the consumer.A consumer’s interpretation of the representation, omission, or practice is considered reasonable under the circumstances.The misleading representation, omission, or practice is material.


   Examples of Unfair Trade Practices in Insurance  

Unfair trade practices can happen in any industry but are significant enough to prompt the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) to issue guidance related to the sale of insurance products. The NAIC defines unfair trade practices in the following ways:



It misrepresents the benefits, advantages, conditions, or terms of any policy.It misrepresents the dividends or share of the surplus to be received on any policy.It makes a false or misleading statement as to the dividends or share of surplus previously paid on any policy.It is misleading or is a misrepresentation as to the financial condition of any insurer, or as to the legal reserve system upon which any life insurer operates.It uses any name or title of any policy or class of policies misrepresenting the true nature thereof.It is a misrepresentation, including any intentional misquote of the premium rate, for the purpose of inducing or tending to induce the purchase, lapse, forfeiture, exchange, conversion, or surrender of any policy.It is a misrepresentation for the purpose of effecting a pledge or assignment of or effecting a loan against any policy.It misrepresents any policy as being shares of stock.



The NAIC considers a deceptive trade practice to be any of the above acts coupled with the conditions below:



It is committed flagrantly and in conscious disregard of the act or of any rules promulgated hereunder.It has been committed with such frequency to indicate a general business practice to engage in that type of conduct.
What Is Unfavorable Variance?  

Unfavorable variance is an accounting term that describes instances where actual costs are greater than the standard or projected costs. An unfavorable variance can alert management that the company's profit will be less than expected. The sooner an unfavorable variance is detected, the sooner attention can be directed towards fixing any problems.





Key Takeaways

Unfavorable variance is an accounting term that describes instances where actual costs are higher than the standard or projected costs.An unfavorable variance can alert management that the company's profit will be less than expected.The unfavorable variance could be the result of lower revenue, higher expenses, or a combination of both.


   Understanding Unfavorable Variance  

A budget is a forecast of revenue and expenses, including fixed costs as well as variable costs. Budgets are important to corporations because it helps them plan for the future by projecting how much revenue is expected to be generated from sales. As a result, companies can plan how much to spend on various projects or investments in the company. 



Companies create sales budgets, which forecast how many new customers for new products and services are going to be sold by the sales staff in the coming months. From there, companies can determine the revenue that will be generated and the costs needed to bring in those sales and deliver those products and services. Eventually, the company can project its net income or profit after subtracting all of the fixed and variable costs from total revenue. If the net income is less than their forecasts, the company has an unfavorable variance. 



In other words, the company hasn't generated as much profit as it had hoped. However, an unfavorable variance doesn't necessarily mean the company took a loss. Instead, it merely means that the net income was lower than the forecasted projections for the period.



The unfavorable variance could be the result of lower revenue, higher expenses, or a combination of both. Oftentimes, an unfavorable variance could be due to a combination of factors. The shortfall could be due, in part, to an increase in variable costs, such as a price increase in the cost of raw materials, which go into producing the product. The unfavorable variance could also be due, in part, to lower sales results versus the projected numbers. 


   Types of Unfavorable Variances  

In practice, an unfavorable variance can take any number of forms or definitions. In budgeting or financial planning and analysis scenarios, unplanned deviations from plan invite the same managerial reactions as unfavorable variances in other business applications. When business results deviate from expectations–the ensuing analysis may describe the variance in different ways–but the end result is usually the same: things did not go according to plan.



In finance, unfavorable variance refers to a difference between an actual experience and a budgeted experience in any financial category where the actual outcome is less favorable than the projected outcome. Publicly-traded companies with stocks listed on exchanges, such as the NewYork Stock Exchange (NYSE) typically forecast earnings or net income quarterly or annually. Companies that fail to meet their earnings forecasts essentially have an unfavorable variance within their company–whether it be from higher costs, lower revenue, or lower sales.



A sales variance occurs when the projected sales volumes of a product or service don't meet the goal or projected figures. A company may not have hired enough sales staff to bring in the projected number of new clients. A management team could analyze whether to bring in temporary workers to help boost sales efforts. Management could also offer target-based financial incentives to salespeople or create more robust marketing campaigns to generate buzz in the marketplace for their product or service.



In manufacturing, the standard cost of a finished product is calculated by adding the standard costs of the direct material, direct labor, and direct overhead, which are the direct costs tied to production. An unfavorable variance is the opposite of a favorable variance where actual costs are less than standard costs. Rising costs for direct materials or inefficient operations within the production facility could be the cause of an unfavorable variance in manufacturing.


   Causes of Unfavorable Variances  

An unfavorable variance can occur due to changing economic conditions, such as lower economic growth, lower consumer spending, or a recession, which leads to higher unemployment. Market conditions can also change, such as new competitors entering the market with new products and services. Companies could also suffer from lower revenue and sales if new technology advances make their products outdated or obsolete.



It's critical that a company's management team analyze an unfavorable variance and pinpoint the cause. Once the cause is determined, the company can make the necessary changes and get back on target with their plan.


   Example of Unfavorable Variance  

For example, let's say that a company's sales were budgeted to be $200,000 for a period. However, the company only generated $180,000 in sales. The unfavorable variance would be $20,000, or 10%.



Similarly, if expenses were projected to be $200,000 for the period but were actually $250,000, there would be an unfavorable variance of $50,000, or 25%.
What Is Unfunded Pension Plan?  

An unfunded pension plan is an employer-managed retirement plan that uses the employer's current income to fund pension payments as they become necessary. This is in contrast to an advance funded pension plan where an employer sets aside funds systematically and in advance to cover any pension plan expenses such as payments to retirees and their beneficiaries.





Key Takeaways

Unfunded pension plans do not have any assets set aside, meaning that retirement benefits are usually paid directly from employer contributions.Also called pay-as-you-go plans, these retirement accounts can be set up by companies or governments.Government pension programs of many European countries are considered unfunded plans.


   Understanding Unfunded Pension Plans  

A pension plan is a program offered by certain employers that provides a salary replacement when an employee is no longer working (for example, when the employee retires). When employers offer a pension plan, they can plan for the anticipated financial requirements of the pension plan and set aside a certain amount of money on a regular basis—and invest the money to ideally grow the fund or fund the pension plan out of current earnings. 



An unfunded pension plan is sometimes referred to as a pay-as-you-go pension plan. Many public pension arrangements provided by a state are unfunded, with benefits paid directly from current workers' contributions and taxes. The pension systems of many European countries are unfunded, having benefits paid directly out of current taxes and social security contributions.


  Hybrid vs. Fully Funded  

Several countries have hybrid systems, which are partially funded. Spain set up the Social Security Reserve Fund and France set up the Pensions Reserve Fund. In Canada, the wage-based retirement plan (CPP) is partially funded, with assets managed by the CPP Investment Board, while the U.S. Social Security system is partially funded by investment in special U.S. Treasury Bonds.



Fully funded, in contrast, is a term that describes when a pension plan has sufficient assets to provide for all accrued benefits. In order to be fully funded, the plan must be able to make all the anticipated payments to pensioners. A plan's administrator is able to predict the amount of funds that will be needed on a yearly basis. This can help determine the financial health of the pension plan.


   Pay-As-You-Go  

Both individual companies and governments can set up pay-as-you-go pensions. The level of control exercised by individual participants of an unfunded pension plan depends on the structure of the plan and whether the plan is privately or publicly run. Unfunded pension plans run by governments may use the word "contribution" to describe the money that enters the fund, but usually, these contributions are taxed at a set rate and neither workers nor employers who contribute have any choice about if or how much they pay in to the plan. Private pay-as-you-go pensions, however, offer their participants some discretion.



If an employer offers a pay-as-you-go pension plan, an individual participant likely gets to choose how much of their paycheck they wish to deduct and contribute toward their future pension benefits. Depending on the terms of the plan, a participant may be able to either have a set amount of money pulled out during each pay period or contribute the amount in a lump sum. This is similar to how several defined-contribution plans, such as a 401(k) plans, are funded.
What Is a Unicameral System?  

A unicameral system is a government with one legislative house or chamber. Unicameral is the Latin word that describes a single-house legislative system. Countries with unicameral governments include Armenia, Bulgaria, Denmark, Hungary, Monaco, Ukraine, Serbia, Turkey, and Sweden. Unicameral systems became more popular during the 20th century and some countries, including Greece, New Zealand, and Peru, switched from a bicameral to a unicameral system.



Smaller countries with long-established democracies tend to have unicameral systems while larger countries may have either a unicameral or bicameral system.





Key Takeaways:

A unicameral system is a government with one legislative house or chamber.Armenia, Bulgaria, Denmark, Hungary, Monaco, Ukraine, Serbia, Turkey, and Sweden have unicameral systems.Smaller countries with long-established democracies tend to have unicameral systems.Advantages of a unicameral system are that laws may be passed more efficiently and they can be less costly.


   Understanding a Unicameral System  

To understand how a unicameral system works, consider the national government of Sweden. Sweden has a parliamentary system with a king as the formal head of the country and the prime minister serving as the seat of executive power. There are 349 seats in the Parliament and any political party that receives at least 4% of the vote during the national vote is granted seats. The number of seats each party receives is based on the number of votes received and proportional representation by electoral district. In 2020, nine parties had seats in Parliament, led by the Social Democrats with 100 seats, or 28.7%, and closely followed by the Moderates, with 70 seats, or about 20.1%. The Green Party and the Independents had the smallest share at 4.6% and 0.6% seats, respectively.



Parliament votes on legislative bills, which are proposed by Members of Parliament (MPs) or by government. All bills except the budget and changes to the Constitution are approved by a simple majority vote of the Parliament. Parliament also approves the prime minister. The Parliament meets annually and elections are held every four years. Neither the prime minister nor MPs have term limits.


   Advantages of a Unicameral vs. Bicameral System  

While the major advantage of a bicameral system is that it can provide for checks and balances and prevent potential abuses of power, it can also lead to gridlock that makes the passage of laws difficult. A major advantage of a unicameral system is that laws can be passed more efficiently. A unicameral system may be able to pass legislation too easily, however, and a proposed law that the ruling class supports may be passed even if the majority of citizens do not support it. Special interest groups may influence a unicameral legislature more easily than a bicameral one, and groupthink may be more likely to occur. Because unicameral systems require fewer legislators than bicameral systems, however, they may require less money to operate. These systems may also introduce fewer bills and have shorter legislative sessions.



A unicameral system for the U.S. government was proposed by the Articles of Confederation in 1781, but the delegates to the Constitutional Convention in 1787 created a plan for a bicameral system that was modeled on the English system. America’s founders could not agree on whether the states should each have the same number of representatives or whether the number of representatives should be based on population. The founders decided to do both in an agreement known as the Great Compromise, establishing the bicameral system of the Senate and the House that we still use today.



The U.S. federal government and all the states except Nebraska use a bicameral system while U.S. cities, counties, and school districts commonly use the unicameral system, as do all the Canadian provinces. Initially, Georgia, Pennsylvania, and Vermont had unicameral legislatures based on the idea that a true democracy should not have two houses representing an upper class and a common class. Instead, a democracy should have single house representing all people. Each of these states turned to a bicameral system: Georgia in 1789, Pennsylvania in 1790, and Vermont in 1836. Similar to the United States, Australia also has just one state with a unicameral system: Queensland.



A Republican named George Norris successfully campaigned to change Nebraska’s legislature from a bicameral to a unicameral system in 1937. Norris claimed that the bicameral system was outdated, inefficient, and unnecessary. Norris said a unicameral system could maintain a system of checks and balances by relying on the power of citizens to vote and petition and by relying on the Supreme Court and the governor on matters that required another opinion. Further, a bill may only contain one subject and may not pass until five days after its introduction. Most Nebraska bills also receive a public hearing and each bill must be voted on separately three times.



Some countries with unicameral systems have always held such a system while others have changed at some point by merging two houses or abolishing one. New Zealand abolished its upper house in the early 1950s when the Opposition party took control from the Labour party and voted to do away with the upper house.
What Is a Unicorn?  

The term unicorn refers to a privately held startup company with a value of over $1 billion. It is commonly used in the venture capital industry. The term was first popularized by venture capitalist Aileen Lee. Unicorns are very rare and require innovation. Because of their sheer size, unicorn investors tend to be private investors or venture capitalists, which means they are out of the reach of retail investors. Although it isn't necessary, many unicorns work their way to going public.





Key Takeaways

Unicorn is the term used in the venture capital industry to describe a startup company with a value of over $1 billion. The term was first coined by venture capitalist Aileen Lee in 2013.Some popular unicorns include SpaceX, Robinhood, and Instacart.There are more than 1,000 unicorn companies around the world, as of March 2022.The term unicorn can also be used by human resources managers to describe their ideal candidates, who may be overqualified for a certain position.

   Understanding Unicorns  

A unicorn is what most people in the financial world call a startup that is privately owned with a valuation that exceeds $1 billion. Reaching unicorn status is a rare feat. In order to become a unicorn, companies must have an innovative idea, a clear vision for growth, and a solid business plan, as well as a viable way to get their message to venture capitalists and private investors.



There are several options that unicorns have when it comes to their exit options, including:



Remaining private. Founders who want to retain control tend to keep their unicorns private. But this limits the potential for growth. And they often must find ways to provide funders with a return on their investments.
Going public. Companies get access to the capital they need to grow with an initial public offering (IPO). Some unicorn executives may be slow to take their companies public because it means diluting ownership.
Appealing to a buyer. Company owners and executives can achieve their goals quicker than if they remain private or by going public.



The term was coined by Aileen Lee, founder of Palo Alto-based Cowboy Ventures, a seed-stage venture capital fund. She first wrote about them in her article, "Welcome to the Unicorn Club: Learning from Billion-Dollar Startups," in which she looked at software startups founded in the 2000s and estimated that only 0.07% of them ever reach a $1 billion valuations. According to Lee, startups that reached this mark are so rare that finding one is as difficult as finding a mythical unicorn.



According to Lee, the first unicorns were founded in the 1990s. Alphabet (GOOG)—then Google—she noted, was the clear super-unicorn of the group with a valuation of more than $100 billion. Many unicorns were born in the 2000s, though Meta (META), formerly Facebook, is the decade's only super-unicorn. Some of the other more popular unicorns based in the U.S. include home-sharing giant Airbnb, video game company Epic Games, as well as fintech companies Robinhood and SoFi.






While unicorns are startups with valuations of over $1 billion, companies with valuations of over $10 billion are sometimes referred to as decacorns.






   Special Considerations  

The term isn't just exclusive to the world of startups. In fact, it is also a common word used to describe s recruitment phenomenon within the human resources (HR) sector.



HR managers may have high expectations to fill a position, leading them to look for candidates with higher qualifications required for a specific job. In essence, they seek unicorns, which creates a huge disconnect between their ideal candidate and those in the pool of people available.



For example, a medium-sized firm may want to recruit someone with marketing, social media, writing, sales, and management experience. And they may seek someone who speaks three different languages. While it may be cost-effective to hire one person with all those skills instead of multiple employees to handle separate tasks, it may be too much for the new hire to handle and can lead to disappointment.


   Unicorn Valuations  

The value of unicorns is generally based on how investors and venture capitalists feel they will grow and develop, so it all comes down to longer-term forecasting. This means their valuations have nothing to do with their financial performance. In fact, many of these companies rarely generate any profits when they first get running.



Investors and capitalists may come across some hurdles, though. If there are no other competitors in the industry—making the startup a first of its kind—there may be no other business model with which to compare, making it a somewhat complicated process.


   Unicorns and Venture Investing  

Since the publication of Lee's article, the word unicorn has become widely used to refer to startups in the technology, mobile technology, and information technology sectors—usually at the intersection of all three—with very high valuations questionably supported by their fundamental finances.



Benchmark Capital partner Bill Gurley wrote about the difference between late-stage private capital fundraising and an IPO in a blog post, saying that "an unprecedented 80 private companies have raised financings at valuations over $1B" since the 2010s, and that "late-stage investors, desperately afraid of missing out on acquiring shareholding positions in possible 'unicorn' companies, have essentially abandoned their traditional risk analysis."



The question of whether the technology sector's unicorns constitute a reinflation of the dotcom bubble of the late 1990s continues to stir debate:



People like John Mullins (who wrote the book The Customer-Funded Business) argue that the increase in the number of new companies valued above $1 billion is a clear sign of froth in markets.
Others argue that a large number of companies with high valuations is a reflection of a new wave of technologically-driven productivity, similar to the invention of the printing press nearly 600 years ago. For example, SV Angel made the most early-stage investments in companies valued at over $1 billion, according to 2019 data.
Still, others suggest that globalization and the monetary policy of central banks created great waves of capital sloshing around the globe on a hunt for unicorns since the Great Recession.






Research shows that at least one in three unicorns went public as of 2019.


   Examples of Unicorns  

Far from being merely mythological creatures, unicorns are a regular feature in business and finance. In fact, there are more than 1,000 unicorns around the world, as of March 2022. Collectively, they are valued at over $3,516 billion.



Some familiar U.S.-based unicorns include Uber, Airbnb, SpaceX, Palantir Technologies, WeWork, and Pinterest. China claims a number of unicorns as well, including Didi Chuxing, Xiaomi, China Internet Plus Holding (Meituan Dianping), and Lu.com.



The following are some examples of very popular unicorns.


  Nuro  

One hot unicorn startup is Nuro, an autonomous vehicle delivery company that was founded by two engineers from Waymo, which is Google's self-driving car project. Founded in 2016, Nuro became a unicorn startup after receiving a $940 million investment from SoftBank Group, which put the company's valuation at $2.7 billion.



Nuro found a unique space in the autonomous vehicle industry, focusing on zero-emissions local delivery vehicles. Since then, Nuro has grown and acquired other startups including Ike Robotics. The company now has a few pilots, including its R1 and R2 generation of cars that is prototyping deliveries of medical supplies in California, as well as groceries in Fry's Food and Drug and Kroger stores. In March 2022, Nuro hit a valuation of $8.6 billion.


  Instacart  

Grocery delivery app Instacart is also another unicorn with over $2.7 billion in funding. The company was founded in San Francisco in 2012 and boasts over 500,000 items from local stores including Whole Foods, Safeway, Jewel-Osco, Costco, and Harris Teeter.



As of March 2022, the company slashed its $39 billion valuation by nearly 40% to about $24 billion. The move was motivated by market conditions and the need to appeal to a better labor pool.




What Is a Unicorn in Business?
The term unicorn is used in the corporate world to describe a startup company with a valuation of over $1 billion.




How Many Unicorn Companies Are There?
There are more than 1,000 unicorns around the world, as of March 2022. Collectively, they are valued at $3,516 billion.




Is Amazon a Unicorn Company?
Unicorns are typically used to describe privately-held startup companies with market caps of over $1 billion, so Amazon is not considered a unicorn company, as it is public. When Amazon went public on May 15, 1997, it raised $54 million, which gave it a market cap of $438 million, which was still well below the key $1 billion mark.




Why Are Startups Called Unicorns?
Startups worth over $1 billion are called unicorns because they are so rare. These companies often have skyrocketing success or market traction, which launches them into almost a mythical category, since they are so rare.




How Can I Invest in a Unicorn?
Unicorns are startup companies. So unless you are a private investor or venture capitalist, they don't really accept a lot of moderately-sized investments. However, interested investors should track the growth of these unicorns if they ever decide to become public companies and IPO.
What Is a Unified Managed Account?  

A unified managed account (UMA) is a professionally managed private investment account that can include multiple types of investments all in a single account. Investments may include mutual funds, stocks, bonds, and exchange-traded funds. Unified managed accounts are often rebalanced on a specified schedule.





Key Takeaways

A unified managed account (UMA) is a privately-managed investment account that can include a variety of investments, such as mutual funds, stock, and bonds.A UMA is typically rebalanced on a regular schedule, making sure the holdings reflect the correct balance of investments. It's a type of account often favored by high net worth investors who want a greater range of investments than what they can get with a separately managed account.UMA providers work with investors to design an integrated portfolio that includes multiple investments, provide support for tax planning, and create an effective rebalancing schedule.


   Understanding Unified Managed Account (UMA)  

The unified managed account is one of a few options a high net worth investor has for managing their assets. The unified managed account is an evolution of the separately managed account, which is similar in that it is a professionally managed account that is rebalanced often. However, separately managed accounts are typically not known for pooling multiple investments and investment vehicles with varying objectives. Separately managed accounts are a high net worth investment alternative, usually offered by an investment manager, that typically focuses on a targeted strategy managed as a separate account for the investor. If an investor wanted to invest across multiple strategies, they would likely have to open multiple separately managed accounts.



A unified managed account is often a better alternative for an investor seeking to combine multiple investments. The UMA removes the need to have more than one account and can combine all of an investor’s assets into one account.






UMA investors pay annual management fees based on the total assets under management (AUM); fees drop as the AUM rise.


   Investing Through a Unified Managed Account  

The same banks and brokerage firms typically offer unified managed accounts as separately managed accounts. Their offering has also broadened to include registered investment advisors and private wealth managers. Technology has been a driving factor supporting their expansion. A unified managed account provider has a much greater overall fiduciary responsibility since they serve as the overseer for a multitude of investments, which can include stock positions, employee stock option plans, third party separate account management, and more.



UMA providers work with high net worth investors to integrate all of a client’s assets. Once the assets have been aggregated, a UMA provider will work with the client in a number of ways. The UMA provider can examine the total portfolio for a comprehensive plan. UMA account planning can include an overlay strategy that seeks to manage the portfolio from a targeted asset allocation diversification approach. UMA providers also offer investors new options with affiliated companies and products that an investor may want to invest in over time. Often a UMA provider will analyze the portfolio to conform with modern portfolio theory given the comprehensive, efficient frontier for which the combined assets create. A UMA provider's alternative options may help a client to align their total portfolio for risk-return optimization better.



UMA providers also offer high net worth clients more streamlined reporting on their investments with greater support for comprehensive tax planning. UMA providers also work with clients to determine a rebalancing schedule that fits their overall investing strategy.



UMA standards vary by provider, and investors will typically sign an agreement detailing the management of the account, its fees, and its allowable investments and structuring. UMA investors typically pay annual management fees based on total assets under management. Fees usually decrease with greater assets under management and can range from 1.50% annually to 3%.
What is a Unified Managed Household Account?  

A unified managed household account (UMHA) is a privately managed account that consolidates multiple unaffiliated products including mutual funds, ETFs, and individual securities. The account allows immediate family members, such as parents and children, to access the account. This type of account allows for ease of administration for the financial institution and greater transparency for the investing family.


   Understanding Unified Managed Household Accounts (UMHA)  

Unified managed household accounts (UMHAs) operate on a single, integrated system, which allows a financial advisor to view various assets and product types to create performance reports. This holistic view also will enable financial advisors to customize investment decisions for each client in the context of their household and to simplify operational procedures that are typically complex and cumbersome. In some UMHA programs, clients can create account groups for each investment goal. The system supports groupings with individual performance reports, billing and statements.



Since this account offers complete transparency, family members can gain a deeper understanding of their assets. Meanwhile, asset management firms can designate a central relationship manager for large families that have accounts located in different parts of the business. Unified managed household accounts (UMHAs) can streamline paperwork, simplify fees and allow for more sophisticated tax management.


   Considerations for a UMHA  

Consumers should be aware of several factors when consolidating accounts into a UMHA. Often, UMHAs are discretionary programs, meaning the financial advisor has the authority to make investing decisions. As with mutual-fund advisory programs, the investor selects a model based on risk tolerance and goals, and the firm takes care of rebalancing or even changing asset allocations altogether, depending on the degree of discretion inherent in a particular program. Therefore, a UMHA's performance will depend largely on the company's success in selecting securities and making adjustments to the allocation. Investors should be selective when choosing the firm that will manage their UMHA.



That said, because of the transparency and simplicity of having all securities under one roof, investors have an opportunity to earn better risk-adjusted and tax-managed returns due to comprehensive oversight, execution, and reporting.  They may also save on fees that are typically charged for each account. Fee discounts may be available based on your household’s assets under management.
What Is a Unified Payments Interface (UPI)?  

A Unified Payments Interface (UPI) is a smartphone application that allows users to transfer money between bank accounts. It is a single-window mobile payment system developed by the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI). It eliminates the need to enter bank details or other sensitive information each time a customer initiates a transaction.





Key Takeaways

The Unified Payments Interface (UPI) is a smartphone application for banking in India.The interface is regulated by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), India's central bank.This app eliminates the need to enter bank details or other sensitive information each time a customer initiates a transaction, making it a safe way to bank.


   How Unified Payments Interface (UPI) Works  

The Unified Payments Interface is a real-time payment system. It is designed to enable peer-to-peer inter-bank transfers through a single two-click factor authentication process. The interface is regulated by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), India's central bank. It works by transferring money between two bank accounts along with a mobile platform.



The system is said to be a safe and secure method of transferring money between two parties and eliminates the need to transact with physical cash or through a bank. The pilot system was launched in India on April 11, 2016. Banks across the country started to upload their interface in Aug. 2016.



UPI uses existing systems, such as Immediate Payment Service (IMPS) and Aadhaar Enabled Payment System (AEPS), to ensure seamless settlement across accounts. It facilitates push (pay) and pull (receive) transactions and even works for over-the-counter or barcode payments, as well as for multiple recurring payments such as utility bills, school fees, and other subscriptions.






In 2021, $940 billion was transacted over UPI, and in 2022, the average monthly transaction count was more than six billion.



Once a single identifier is established, the system allows mobile payments to be delivered without the use of credit or debit cards, net banking, or any need to enter account details. This would not just ensure greater safety of sensitive information, but connect people who have bank accounts via smartphones to carry out hassle-free transactions.



Overall, UPI implies fewer cash transactions and potentially reduces the unbanked population.


   Sending Money vs. Receiving Money  

Sending money on the UPI is called a "push." In order to send money, the user logs into the interface and selects the Send Money/Payment option. After entering the recipient's virtual ID and the amount desired, they choose the account from which the money will be debited. The user then enters a special personal identification number (PIN) and receives a confirmation.



Receiving money through the system is called a "pull." Once the user has logged in to the system, they select the option to collect money. The user then needs to enter the virtual ID for the remitter, the amount to be collected, and the account in which they will deposit the funds. A message then goes to the payer with the request to pay. If they decide to make the payment, they enter their UPI PIN to authorize the transaction.



Once the transfer has been completed, both the sender and the recipient receive a confirmation by text message to their smartphones.


   Services Offered by UPI  

A number of key features are offered by UPI. Users can access balances and transaction histories along with sending and receiving money. To send money, users need an account number, the Indian Financial System Code (or IFSC, which is an alphanumeric code that facilitates electronic transfers), the mobile number of the recipient, and a virtual ID or Aadhaar number (which is like a Social Security number).




Is UPI Available in the U.S.?
Yes, UPI is available in the U.S. You are able to send money to India from the U.S. using UPI. You need the UPI ID of the receiver and can use a variety of banking apps, such as Wise, World Remit, and Remitly.




Which UPI Systems Can You Use in India?
The UPI systems that you can use in India consist of many banking/payment apps that allow you to use UPI. These include PhonePe, Google Pay, Axis Pay, and BHIM.




Is UPI Safe in India?
Yes, UPI is safe in India. It is regulated by India's central bank, the Reserve Bank of India.


   The Bottom Line  

The Unified Payments Interface (UPI) in India is a regulated smartphone tool that allows for mobile payments to be made without debit or credit cards. The UPI has made paying for transactions easier and simpler, facilitating economic movement within the country.
What Is the Unified Tax Credit?  

The unified tax credit, or unified transfer tax, is available to all U.S. taxpayers by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and combines two separate lifetime tax exemptions for gift and estate taxes. The combined exemption limit applies to taxable gifts you make to others during your lifetime, inter vivos gifts, and assets you leave to beneficiaries as testamentary transfers.





Key Takeaways

The unified tax credit defines a dollar amount that an individual can gift during their lifetime and pass on to heirs before gift or estate taxes apply.The tax credit unifies the gift and estate taxes into one tax that decreases the tax bill of the individual or estate, dollar for dollar.The lifetime gift and estate tax exemption for 2022 is $12.06 million for individuals and $24.12 million for married couples filing jointly. For 2023, it is $12.92 million and $25.84 million, respectively.For the tax year 2022, you can give up to $16,000 or $32,000 for spouses "splitting" gifts tax-free to recipients without using any of your lifetime gift and estate tax exemption. For 2023, the numbers are $17,000 and $34,000, respectively.


   Understanding the Unified Tax Credit  

Individuals who give substantial assets to another while living may face gift taxes. Assets left for beneficiaries after death may be subject to estate taxes. The unified tax credit sets an amount that individuals can gift during their lifetime and bequeath to heirs before any gift and estate taxes apply.






The donor is responsible for paying the gift tax; however, the recipient may agree to pay the tax instead. If you are considering this type of arrangement, contact a tax professional for guidance.



The unified tax credit rolls the gift and estate tax exclusions into one tax system and decreases the individual's or estate's tax bill, dollar-for-dollar. An individual or couple who gifts some of their assets may need to file a gift tax return if the value of the assets is higher than the annual exclusion amount. Gifts made to charities or to pay another person's medical or tuition expenses are exempt from gift tax return requirements.


   Annual Gift Tax Exclusion  

Most taxpayers can gift up to $16,000 in 2022 and $17,000 in 2023 without notifying the IRS.The annual exclusion is per person, so married couples filing jointly can gift up to $32,000 in 2022 or $34,000 in 2023 without filing a gift tax return. If you give more than $17,000 in 2023, you must disclose the gift on Form 709. Doing so doesn't necessarily mean you will owe taxes on the amount, but the value over $17,000 may count against your lifetime exemption.



Several types of transfers aren't subject to gift tax requirements:



Gifts that are less than the year's annual exclusion in most casesGifts to a spousePayments that qualify for medical exclusionQualified payments for tuition exclusionTransfers to political organizationsTransfers to certain exempt organizations






According to the IRS, a gift is "any transfer to an individual, either directly or indirectly, where full consideration (measured in money or money's worth) is not received in return."


   Federal Estate Tax Rates  

The 2022 federal tax law applies the estate tax above $12.06 million. Individuals can pass $12.06 million to their heirs, and couples can transfer twice that without paying tax. For 2023, the exemption is $12.92 million for individuals and $25.84 million for married couples filing jointly.



Only a percentage of estates in the U.S. is worth more than these exemption thresholds. For those that are, federal estate tax rates apply to any amount above the exemption thresholds. The federal estate tax maxes out at 40% for taxable amounts above $1 million. Here's a look at how the tax accumulates as the taxable amount increases:

   Unified Credits and Probate  

The probate process can be expensive, so some people use the unified tax credit to save on estate taxes after their deaths. The credit is not used for reducing gift taxes during the individual's lifetime but instead used on the inheritance amount bequeathed to beneficiaries after death.



To take advantage of this lifetime credit, beneficiaries or the decedent’s estate executor must complete IRS Form 706, which is used to determine the estate tax imposed by Chapter 11 of the Internal Revenue Code (IRC).



Taxpayers can use the unified tax credit before or after death or both. Keep up on the annual gift exclusion and gift and estate tax exemption since tax laws change periodically.




What Is the Gift Tax Exclusion for 2022 and 2023?
For 2022, the exclusion is $16,000, and $17,000 in 2023. The annual amount you can gift to a spouse who is not a U.S. citizen is $164,000 and $175,000 in 2023.




What Is the Gift and Estate Tax Exemption for 2022 and 2023?
For 2022, the exemption is $12.06 million or $24.12 million if you're married and filing jointly. For 2023, the exemptions are $12.92 million and $25.84 million, respectively.




Which States Have an Estate Tax?
In addition to the federal estate tax imposed on all states, twelve states and the District of Columbia impose state estate taxes. At 20%, Hawaii and Washington have the highest top estate tax rates. Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, and the District of Columbia have a top tax rate of 16%. Connecticut and Maine share the lowest tax rate, 12%.


   The Bottom Line  

The unified tax credit is available to all U.S. taxpayers by the IRS and combines two separate lifetime tax exemptions for gift and estate taxes. The combined exemption limit applies to taxable gifts you make to others during your lifetime and assets you leave to beneficiaries. Most taxpayers can gift up to $16,000 in 2022 and $17,000 in 2023 without notifying the IRS, but thresholds may change annually. Taxpayers can use the unified tax credit before or after death or both.
What Is the Uniform Bank Performance Report (UBPR)?  

The Uniform Bank Performance Report (UBPR) is an analytical tool created by the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC) to help supervise and examine financial institutions. The UBPR serves as an analysis of the impact that management and economic conditions can have on a bank's balance sheet. It examines liquidity, adequacy of capital and earnings, and other factors that could damage the stability of the bank.





Key Takeaways

The Uniform Bank Performance Report (UBPR) summarizes the financial position, performance, and risk exposures of American banks.These reports include key ratios for the current quarter, previous quarter, year-ago quarter, and also provide year-to-date information.The UBPR is filed in conjunction with a Call Report, which contains additional items such as the bank's financial statements, loans & deposits, investments held, and changes in the bank's capital, among other data.


   Understanding the Uniform Bank Performance Report (UBPR)  

The Uniform Bank Performance Report summarizes the effect of economic conditions and management decisions on the performance of a given bank and the composition of that bank’s balance sheet. The data therein can be used to evaluate whether the bank is earning enough money and has enough liquid assets. It can also be used to manage the bank’s growth, assets, and liabilities. The UBPR is a valuable tool for bankers and bank examiners seeking to understand the financial condition of a given bank, and as such, can be used to maintain the financial fitness of a bank or to restore it to good condition.



Banks traditionally rely heavily on short-term deposits to fund long-term loans to consumers and businesses. This reliance makes a bank susceptible to major problems if conditions turn against it, or it sees a sudden mass withdrawal of deposits. It is why the FFIEC tries to monitor banks' stability with the UBPR.


   UBPR Delivery Schedule  

A given bank’s UBPR will usually be published within 24 hours of filing the associated Call Report with the Central Data Repository. However, if there are errors in the associated Call Report, then the UBPR won’t be published until those errors are rectified.﻿﻿


   UBPR Recalculation Schedule  

The data in a given bank’s UBPR is updated on a continuous basis. Data for the current quarter’s UBPR is recalculated each night and published each morning. Data for the current quarter and the four consecutive previous quarters is recalculated every Friday night and published the next Saturday morning. A 21-period recalculation is done once per quarter. It occurs two weeks before banks start submitting their new Call Reports. The recalculated data is published within a three-day period.﻿﻿



Once most banks have filed their Call Reports, and UBPR data has been calculated, peer group average data is published. Peer group averages for all peer groups but 1 and 2 are published 30 days after the date a Call Report is filed, or on the due date of the Call Report. Peer group average data for groups 1 and 2 is published 35 days after the date a Call Report is filed, or on the date the Call Report is due.﻿﻿
What Is a Uniform Bill of Lading?  

A uniform bill of lading is a standardized agreement between an exporter and a carrier regarding the items or property to be transported.



The uniform bill of lading provides a boilerplate language for the basic information about a shipment such as the shipper and recipient's names and the shipment's origin and destination. In addition, the document establishes the terms of the carrier's liability, transport time frame, how to file a claim for a lost or damaged shipment, how insurance will be applied in the event of a claim, and how the shipment may be stored or disposed of if the shipment is refused or is not deliverable.





Key Takeaways

A uniform bill of lading is a standardized version of the bill of lading that shippers and carriers use.A bill of lading details and itemizes the contents of a shipment to be transported across borders.It also stipulates the contract terms of the shipment including the carrier's liability and insurance, time for shipment, and claims processes.


   Understanding a Uniform Bill of Lading  

The uniform bill of lading also specifies the carrier's liability with regard to specific types of shipments including documents, coin money, items of extraordinary value, and explosives. Additional shipment charges may be assessed if the shipper misrepresents the type of goods being transported.



While the uniform bill of lading is the standard template, other variations also exist, including the inland bill of lading, ocean bill of lading, negotiable bill of lading, and through bill of lading.


  Components of the Bill of Lading   

The bill of lading also represents proof of delivery when the goods are delivered to the destination and signed for by the receiver. These statements reflect either the shipper's representations to the carrier of the terms of the service or the carrier's notes from its own inspection of the goods. If the bill of lading notes the defective condition of the goods or their packaging, it is considered  "claused" or "fouled." If no defects are noted, it is considered a "clean" bill of lading.



The Bill of Lading states that the carrier is responsible for loss, damage, delay, and liability in the transportation of the goods for shippers from the time the carrier receives the goods until delivery is complete. The carriers are responsible for full actual loss. If the receiver finds the freight damaged or unacceptable, the bill of lading can be used as a legal document to dispute the delivery of goods in accordance with the provisions of Title 49 of the Code of Federal Regulations Section 1005, Section 14706, the Carmack Amendment.


   Changes in the Uniform Bill of Lading  

Changes were made to the uniform bill of lading that came into effect in August 2016. The new standard imposed liability only for carriers "shown as transporting the property" on the bill of lading when damages occur. The new rules also changed the time requirements for carriers to complete deliveries. According to Inbound Logistics, the new bill extended the delivery time from reasonable periods to within the "regular course of providing transportation services."
What Is the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC)?  

The Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) is a standardized set of laws and regulations for transacting business. The UCC code was established in 1953 because it was becoming increasingly difficult for companies to transact business across state lines given the various state laws.



The Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) is important since it helps companies in different states to transact with each other by providing a standard legal and contractual framework. The UCC laws have been fully adopted by most states in the U.S. Although there are some slight variations from state to state, the UCC code consists of nine separate articles. The UCC articles govern various types of transactions, including banking and loans.





Key Takeaways

The Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) is a set of business laws that regulate financial contracts and transactions employed across states.The UCC code consists of nine separate articles, each of which covers separate aspects of banking and loans.Companies that conduct business transactions outside of their home state must comply with the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC).The UCC code has been fully adopted by most states and adapted slightly by others.The Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) was not established through Congress but rather by private organizations.


   How the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) Works  

Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) laws regulate sales of personal property and various other transactions. If you’ve ever purchased a business or a vehicle in the past, chances are you signed a UCC-1 statement. The title remains in the lender’s possession until the loan is paid off.



The policies instituted under the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) are largely focused on the activities of small businesses and entrepreneurs. Part of the intent is to clear up confusion over how each state might separately regulate such operations.






Although the UCC code regulates dealings involving personal property, it does not govern real property such as land or any structures attached to land.



The UCC code imposes standards for processing checks and other types of commercial paper. Often it is applied to the property secured by a bank where the title is held until the borrower pays off the balance of the financing.



Companies that conduct business transactions outside of their home state must comply with the applicable UCC law, including when leasing equipment, selling goods, borrowing money, and establishing contracts.


   Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) Articles  

Below is an outline of what the nine different articles in the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) address:



Article 1: General provisions establish definitions and certain parameters for how the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) is to be applied. It was last updated in 2001.



Article 2/2a: The sale of goods, excluding real estate and service contracts. Article 2a covers leases of personal property.



Article 3: Checks, drafts, and other negotiable instruments, such as notes (the promise to pay money). An item is considered negotiable if it can be transferred to another individual and still be enforceable against the original payer.



Article 4/4a: Bank deposits and collections, which covers rules for check processing and automated inter-bank collections. Article 4a focuses on fund transfers.



Article 5: Letters of credit, those of which are issued by a bank for trade facilitation.



Article 6: Bulk sales, auctions, and liquidations of assets. Most states believe this article to be obsolete and the Uniform Law Commission (ULC) has recommended a repeal, which most states have adopted.



Article 7: Documents of title, including warehouse receipts, bulk sales, and bills of lading (BoL).



Article 8: Investment securities; specifically the holding of securities through intermediaries.



Article 9: Secured transactions of personal property, agricultural liens, promissory notes, consignments, and security interests.



The Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) undergoes frequent revisions that address specific articles.


   History of the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC)  

The Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) was not established through Congress. It was created by private organizations that include the Uniform Law Commission (ULC), which is also known as the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws (NCCUSL), and the American Law Institute (ALI).



The ULC was established in 1892 with the purpose of creating uniform commercial law. The organization established a variety of laws from its founding up until the 1950s. In the 1950s, along with the ALI, the ULC compiled all the commercial laws into one set of commercial codes for states to follow.



The UCC was presented to the states in 1951, with Pennsylvania being the first to adopt the UCC in 1953 with other states adopting the code over time. Louisiana is now the only state that has not fully ratified the code, though it has adopted part of it.


   Special Considerations  

Each state has the option of adopting the code as it is written or adopting and modifying provisions of it.



Louisiana did not adopt Article 2 of the Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) as written. The state also did not adopt Article 2A, which covers the lease and rental of personal property that is not regarded as real estate.



California has made some modifications, too, implementing its own version of the UCC laws. Real estate contracts are one of the exceptions to California's adoption of the UCC. For the purchase of real estate, such as a warehouse, the laws regulating this purchase are not in California's commercial code but rather the laws and regulations specifically set by the state regarding real estate.



Service contracts in California are also not covered by the UCC. Service contracts include auto repairs, painting jobs, interior decor, and so on. These activities are covered by state insurance laws.




Who Does the Uniform Commercial Code Protect?
The Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) was established to protect all individuals engaged in business. It was created in order to standardize commerce between states, whether that commerce occurs between individuals or businesses.




What Does the Uniform Commercial Code Article 2 and 2A Cover?
Uniform Commercial Code Article 2 covers the sale of goods, excluding real estate and service contracts, while Article 2a covers leases of personal property.




How Does a UCC Lien Work?
A UCC lien, also known as a UCC filing, is a form that a creditor files to provide notice that they have an interest in the property of a debtor, whether that property is personal or business. The overall purpose of a UCC lien is to allow a creditor to claim collateral on financing with a debtor. The creditor will have the right to the property in the lien until the financial obligation has been repaid by the debtor.




What Is the UCC Filing Fee?
The UCC filing fee is $40 for paper filings and $20 for electronic filings in New York.
What Is the Uniform Consumer Credit Code (UCCC)?  

The Uniform Consumer Credit Code (UCCC) is a draft law, adopted by 11 states, that governs consumer credit transactions. It establishes rules related to the issuance and use of all types of credit products from credit cards to mortgages. The code is intended to protect consumers from fraud and unfair practices on the part of lenders.





Key Takeaways

The Uniform Consumer Credit Code (UCCC) is intended to prevent fraud and abuse in credit transactions.Eleven states have adopted the code, while others have incorporated some of its provisions into their laws.The code provides guidelines for credit, including limitations on interest rates, protection from usury, and the establishment of fair contracts.


   How the Uniform Consumer Credit Code (UCCC) Works  

The Uniform Consumer Credit Code was approved by the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws in 1968 and revised in 1974. The code is not in itself a federal or state law, but states may use it in order to write consistent consumer credit laws.



Although it's not if effect nationally, the code has been adopted by 11 states—Colorado, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Maine, Oklahoma, South Carolina, Utah, Wisconsin, and Wyoming—with other states incorporating at least some of its provisions into their laws.



One of the most significant guidelines in the UCCC is the limitation on interest rates charged by lenders. However, the actual ceilings on rates vary according to the type of credit issued. The code also encourages lower interest rates by limiting barriers to entry in the consumer credit field. The codes do this on the theory that more competition will result in lower consumer interest rates.



Beyond protection from usury—the illegal lending of money and charging of unreasonably high fees—many of the guidelines concern the establishment of fair contracts issued to consumers by lenders. For instance, the code prohibits the use of waiver-of-defense clauses in lending. A waiver-of-defense clause states that a borrower relinquishes the right to any legal defense in the event of a conflict with the lender. Such provisions allow a lender to receive a summary judgment against a borrower with no opportunity for protection in either court or arbitration.



The code also limits so-called "unconscionable transactions." What constitutes an unconscionable transaction can be subject to interpretation, but it typically involves negotiations that are so overwhelmingly one-sided as to be deemed unenforceable. These unilateral practices may include warranty disclaimers or the blatant misrepresentation of products.



Federal law has superseded some of the code's guidelines. One example is restrictions on aggressive collection practices, which are now governed by the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA). Another is the original guideline on disclosure of loan terms. The Truth in Lending Act (TILA) now contains those rules.


   History of the Uniform Consumer Credit Code (UCCC)  

As mentioned above, the UCCC was established in 1968 as a way to protect consumers from predatory and questionable credit transactions. Amendments were made in 1974 to update the code as the financial industry and legal landscape were changing.



For example, credit cards were a relatively new type of consumer credit when the first version of the code was written. But with the increase in credit card usage, the current UCCC guidelines have proven crucial to safeguarding consumers. One primary directive says the bank issuing a credit card is also subject to the claims of a cardholder against a merchant.



As new technologies and systems become available and the financial landscape changes, certain services remain exempt from the UCCC. As an example, income-share agreements (ISAs) introduced by Purdue and other by universities have not been subject to the UCCC. Under such agreements, an educational institution takes on a portion of the student's expenses in exchange for a share of their future income.



The UCCC was developed by the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws—also known as the Uniform Law Commission. The commission was created in 1892 to help states draft laws "on subjects on which uniformity across the states is desirable and practicable." More than 300 commissioners—all of whom are lawyers—are appointed by the 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands.



To date, the commission has been responsible for more than 300 uniform acts including the UCCC and the Uniform Commerical Code (UCC). The UCC is a set of laws and regulations meant to help standardize business transactions between entities in different states. The code was established in 1952 in response to the problems companies faced doing business across state lines. Now adopted universally by all states, the UCC provides legal guidelines and standards that govern transactions such as banking and lending.



Other uniform acts developed by the commission cover a variety of legal matters, including family and domestic law, real estate, probate, commercial law, dispute resolution, trusts, and estate law.




How Are Commissioners Appointed to the Uniform Law Commission?
According to the Uniform Law Commission, "Each jurisdiction determines the method of appointment and its number of commissioners. In most states, the governor appoints the state's commissioners to serve a specified term. In a few states, ULC commissioners serve at the will of the appointing authority and have no specific term."It adds that "ULC commissioners are volunteers who do not receive salaries or other compensation for their public service."




What's the Difference Between a Uniform Code and a Model Act?
Uniform codes, or uniform laws, are drafted by the Uniform Law Commission and may be adopted by state legislatures partially or in their entirety. Model acts can be drafted by anyone. They are rarely enacted in their entirety but serve as guidelines. The Uniform Law Commission has also drafted model acts.




What Federal Laws Protect Credit Card Holders?
Credit card holders are protected by a number of federal, as well as state, laws. The most recent major law on the federal level is the Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure Act of 2009, also known as the CARD Act, which amended the Truth in Lending Act. Its provisions include clearer disclosure of credit terms and limits on the fees that lenders can charge.


   The Bottom Line  

The Uniform Consumer Credit Code (UCCC) establishes legal rules to protect consumers who use credit in the states where it has been enacted. It works in conjunction with a variety of federal laws with the same aim.
What Is Uniform Distribution?  

In statistics, uniform distribution refers to a type of probability distribution in which all outcomes are equally likely. A deck of cards has within it uniform distributions because the likelihood of drawing a heart, a club, a diamond, or a spade is equally likely. A coin also has a uniform distribution because the probability of getting either heads or tails in a coin toss is the same.



The uniform distribution can be visualized as a straight horizontal line, so for a coin flip returning a head or tail, both have a probability p = 0.50 and would be depicted by a line from the y-axis at 0.50.





Key Takeaways

Uniform distributions are probability distributions with equally likely outcomes.In a discrete uniform distribution, outcomes are discrete and have the same probability.In a continuous uniform distribution, outcomes are continuous and infinite.In a normal distribution, data around the mean occur more frequently.The frequency of occurrence decreases the farther you are from the mean in a normal distribution.


   Understanding Uniform Distribution  

There are two types of uniform distributions: discrete and continuous. The possible results of rolling a die provide an example of a discrete uniform distribution: it is possible to roll a 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6, but it is not possible to roll a 2.3, 4.7, or 5.5. Therefore, the roll of a die generates a discrete distribution with p = 1/6 for each outcome. There are only 6 possible values to return and nothing in between.






The plotted results from rolling a single die will be discretely uniform, whereas the plotted results (averages) from rolling two or more dice will be normally distributed.



Some uniform distributions are continuous rather than discrete. An idealized random number generator would be considered a continuous uniform distribution. With this type of distribution, every point in the continuous range between 0.0 and 1.0 has an equal opportunity of appearing, yet there is an infinite number of points between 0.0 and 1.0.



There are several other important continuous distributions, such as the normal distribution, chi-square, and Student's t-distribution.



There are also several data generating or data analyzing functions associated with distributions to help understand the variables and their variance within a data set. These functions include probability density function, cumulative density, and moment generating functions.


   Visualizing Uniform Distributions  

A distribution is a simple way to visualize a set of data. It can be shown either as a graph or in a list, revealing which values of a random variable have lower or higher chances of happening. There are many different types of probability distributions, and the uniform distribution is perhaps the simplest of them all. 



Under a uniform distribution, each value in the set of possible values has the same possibility of happening. When displayed as a bar or line graph, this distribution has the same height for each potential outcome. In this way, it can look like a rectangle and therefore is sometimes described as the rectangular distribution. If you think about the possibility of drawing a particular suit from a deck of playing cards, there is a random yet equal chance of pulling a heart as there is for pulling a spade—that is, 1/4 or 25%.



The roll of a single dice yields one of six numbers: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6. Because there are only 6 possible outcomes, the probability of you landing on any one of them is 16.67% (1/6). When plotted on a graph, the distribution is represented as a horizontal line, with each possible outcome captured on the x-axis, at the fixed point of probability along the y-axis.

   Uniform Distribution vs. Normal Distribution  

Probability distributions help you decide the probability of a future event. Some of the most common probability distributions are discrete uniform, binomial, continuous uniform, normal, and exponential. Perhaps one of the most familiar and widely used is the normal distribution, often depicted as a bell curve.



Normal distributions show how continuous data is distributed and assert that most of the data is concentrated on the mean or average. In a normal distribution, the area under the curve equals 1 and 68.27% of all data falls within 1 standard deviation—how dispersed the numbers are—from the mean; 95.45% of all data falls within 2 standard deviations from the mean, and approximately 99.73% of all data falls within 3 standard deviations from the mean.﻿﻿ As the data moves away from the mean, the frequency of data occurring decreases.



Discrete uniform distribution shows that variables in a range have the same probability of occurring. There are no variations in probable outcomes and the data is discrete, rather than continuous. Its shape resembles a rectangle, rather than the normal distribution's bell. Like a normal distribution, however, the area under the graph is equal to 1.


   Example of Uniform Distribution  

There are 52 cards in a traditional deck of cards. In it are four suits: hearts, diamonds, clubs, and spades. Each suit contains an A, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, J, Q, K, and 2 jokers. However, we'll do away with the jokers and face cards for this example, focusing only on number cards replicated in each suit. As a result, we are left with 40 cards, a set of discrete data.



Suppose you want to know the probability of pulling a 2 of hearts from the modified deck. The probability of pulling a 2 of hearts is 1/40 or 2.5%. Each card is unique; therefore, the likelihood that you will pull any one of the cards in the deck is the same.



Now, let's consider the likelihood of pulling a heart from the deck. The probability is significantly higher. Why? We are now only concerned with the suits in the deck. Since there are only four suits, pulling a heart yields a probability of 1/4 or 25%.


   Uniform Distribution FAQs  
  What Does Uniform Distribution Mean?  

Uniform distribution is a probability distribution that asserts that the outcomes for a discrete set of data have the same probability.


  What Is the Formula for Uniform Distribution?  

The formula for a discrete uniform distribution is

​Px​=n1​where:Px​=Probability of a discrete valuen=Number of values in the range​



As with the example of the die, each side contains a unique whole number. The probability of rolling the die and getting any one number is 1/6, or 16.67%.


  Is a Uniform Distribution Normal?  

Normal indicates the way data is distributed about the mean. Normal data shows that the probability of a variable occurring around the mean, or the center, is higher. Fewer data points are observed the farther you move away from this average, meaning the probability of a variable occurring far away from the mean is lower. The probability is not uniform with normal data, whereas it is constant with a uniform distribution. Therefore, a uniform distribution is not normal.


  What Is the Expectation of a Uniform Distribution?  

It is expected that a uniform distribution will result in all possible outcomes having the same probability. The probability for one variable is the same for another.
What Is the Uniform Gifts to Minors Act (UGMA)?  

The Uniform Gifts to Minors Act (UGMA) allows individuals to give or transfer assets to underage beneficiaries. The act, which was developed in 1956 and revised in 1966, is commonly used to transfer assets from parents to their children. The amount is free of gift tax, up to a certain amount. The assets are usually placed in UGMA accounts on behalf of minors, eliminating the need for an attorney to establish a special trust fund. UGMA funds are also subject to special tax treatment.





Key Takeaways

The Uniform Gifts to Minors Act provides a way to transfer financial assets to a minor without the time-consuming and expensive establishment of a formal trust.A UGMA account is managed by an adult custodian until the minor beneficiary comes of age, at which point they assume control of the account.UGMA account-generated earnings are not tax-sheltered, but they are taxed at the minor's lower kiddie tax rate, up to a certain amount.These accounts are easy to set up and provide a great deal of flexibility because they can be used for any purposeUGMA accounts are irrevocable and provide no tax benefits to the donor.


   How a UGMA Account Works  

A UGMA account functions as a type of custodial account. It is designed to hold and protect assets for the beneficiary. The donor can appoint themselves, another person, or a financial institution in the role of custodian. The custodian has the authority to buy stocks, bonds, mutual funds, and other securities on behalf of the minor.



UGMA accounts can be opened through a bank or brokerage institution. Friends and family can make contributions to the accounts, which carry no contribution or income limits. Contributions are made with after-tax dollars, which means donors don't receive an income tax deduction. Deposits are irrevocable. This means that they become permanent transfers to the minor and the minor's account. So the transfer cannot be reversed.



UGMA assets are typically used to fund a child’s education, but the donor can make withdrawals for just about any expenses that benefit the beneficiary. There are no withdrawal penalties. However, because UGMA assets are technically owned by the minor, they do count as assets if they apply for federal financial aid for college, possibly decreasing their eligibility.



Once they reach the age of majority in their state, minors are granted full access to their UGMA account. At that point, they may use the funds as they please.






Custodians have a fiduciary duty to manage the account in the beneficiary's best interest.


   Special Considerations  

The minor or beneficiary is considered the owner of all assets in a UGMA account and the income they generate for tax purposes. But the earnings can be taxed either to the child or the parent. Reporting requirements depend on the amount of income the account generates and the beneficiary’s age.



A UGMA can affect a donor’s lifetime gifting limits for tax purposes. Should a donor who acts as the custodian die before the custodial property is transferred to the minor, the entire custodial property is included in the donor's taxable estate.






Up to $16,000 per individual can be contributed free of gift tax for the calendar year 2022. This amount increases to $17,000 for the 2023 tax year.


   Uniform Gifts to Minors Act (UGMA) vs. Uniform Transfers to Minors Act (UTMA)  

The terms UGMA and Uniform Transfers to Minors Act (UTMA) are usually used interchangeably. In fact, the UTMA, which was established in 1986, is an extension of the UGMA. There are some unique similarities between the two, in that they both require that donors name a custodian. This individual manages and invests the assets until the beneficiary comes of age. And both contend that any assets belong to the minor once gifted.



Having said that, there are some distinctions between the UGMA and UTMA. Custodial accounts set up under the UTMA can contain any kind of tangible or intangible asset, including real estate, works of art, and intellectual property. In contrast, UGMA accounts are limited to financial assets, such as cash, stocks, bonds, and insurance products (policies, annuities).



The UTMA allows children to take advantage of investing without having any associated tax burdens. The gift tax exclusion provided by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) was up to $16,000 per person for 2022 ($17,000 for 2023) for a qualifying gift, including gifts to minors.


   UGMA vs. 529 Plans  

As noted above, UGMA accounts come with no withdrawal penalties. This means that accounts can be used to pay for various expenses, including the costs to fund an education. But there is another type of account that parents can use to save for their children's studies—notably the 529 plan.



A 529 plan is a tax-advantaged savings account that is intended solely for qualified educational expenses, including tuition, equipment, and certain living costs. Originally meant for just postsecondary education, parents can now use 529 plans for any qualified education expenses beginning in kindergarten. It also covers apprentice program expenses.



Here's how they work. Anyone can open an account, including parents and grandparents. Unlike UGMA accounts, there are contribution limits for 529 plans, which vary by state. The limits tend to be very high, so many parents don't have to worry about hitting the ceiling. The money invested in a 529 plan is allowed to grow on a tax-deferred basis. Any withdrawals made from the account are tax-free provided they are used for qualified education expenses.



529 plans come in two different types:



Prepaid Tuition Plans: These prepaid plans lock in future tuition costs at the current rate at specific colleges and universities. As such, account holders can lock in tuition prices and save money in the future.
Savings Plans: These accounts work just like individual retirement accounts (IRAs).






UGMAs are usually limited to publicly-traded financial assets, which means they cannot invest in speculative instruments, like derivatives, or buy on margin.


   Advantages and Disadvantages of UGMA  

There are a number of benefits and drawbacks that come with using the UGMA to help save for a minor's future. We've listed some of the most common below.


  Advantages  

One of the main benefits of having UGMA accounts is that they're simple, easy to understand, and very easy to set up. You can do so through a financial institution or a brokerage firm. And they can be set up by anyone, including family or friends.



UGMA accounts come with no contribution limits. Just keep in mind that there is a gift tax imposed by the IRS, which does place caps on how much individuals can set aside as a gift to others. Similarly, there are no withdrawal limits or restrictions. This means that money can be taken out at any time and for whatever reason.



There is more flexibility when it comes to how you can use a UGMA account. Unlike other plans, you aren't limited to using the funds or assets for things like education.



One of the biggest advantages is that they allow parents and others to skip the trust process. The assets placed within a UGMA account automatically become the property of the minor, which means there's no question of ownership.


  Disadvantages  

All UGMA accounts are irrevocable. As such, once you transfer assets to the account, they become the property of the minor and are no longer yours. This means that you can't change your mind, so once the transfer is complete, it's there for good.



UGMAs can be used against the beneficiary if they want to get any type of financial aid in the future, including student loans. That's because they're considered the child's property. If the value of the account is fairly substantial, it may decrease the amount of aid they may receive—if they get any at all.



There are no tax benefits to owning a UGMA account. The IRS doesn't allow any tax credits or tax deductions for setting aside money in a child's UGMA like it would for a 529 plan.





Pros

Easy to understand and set up
No contribution and no withdrawal limits
Provides more flexibility
Skips the trust process



Cons

Irrevocable
May change or eliminate eligibility for financial aid
No tax advantages





   Contribution Limits and Taxes  

As noted above, there are no actual limits to how much you can contribute to a UGMA account. But there is an important consideration when it comes to these types of accounts: Anything you contribute to your child's UGMA account may be considered a gift.



The IRS puts caps on how much anyone can gift another individual. For 2022, parents can gift as much as $16,000 to their children without any tax consequences. That amount was adjusted for inflation for the 2023 tax year to $17,000.



But what about taxation? Under certain circumstances, parents may report their children’s UGMA accounts on their own tax returns and take advantage of the kiddie tax or the Tax on a Child's Investment and Other Unearned Income. This means that parents can report their child’s income on their own tax return if the child's unearned income, including UGMA earnings, was less than $2,300 in 2022 ($2,500 in 2023) and they were no older than 19 (or 24 if a full-time student).



In this case, the first $1,150 of the child’s unearned income is treated as tax-free (increasing to $1,250 in 2023). The next $1,150 is taxed at the child’s tax rate. Anything exceeding $2,300 is taxed at the parent's tax rate. If such an election is not made or if the child’s unearned income exceeded $2,300 at the end of the tax year, the minor would have to file a tax return subject to “kiddie tax” rules.




How Are Gifts to Minors Taxed?
Financial gifts in the amount of up to $16,000 in 2022 are exempt from taxes. This increases to $17,000 in 2023. Gifts in any amount over this amount per year will be taxed.




What Is a Downside to the Uniform Gifts to Minors Act?
As the assets in a UGMA account are owned by the minor, this can reduce the amount of financial aid they may receive. If the balance of the UGMA account is too high, it may disqualify them completely from any financial aid. This is true even if they haven't reached the age of majority and can't access the account until a certain date.]




Where Can I Open a Uniform Gifts to Minors Account?
A Uniform Gifts to Minors account is an easy-to-understand vehicle that can be opened at a brokerage institution or a bank. Anyone can contribute assets to these accounts. One thing that depositors should remember is that whatever they put into the accounts becomes irrevocable and the property of the beneficiary.


   The Bottom Line  

There are many ways that parents and others can help secure the financial futures of their children or other minors. The Uniform Gifts to Minors Act provides one way to do so. UGMA accounts are easy to open and understand and allow individuals to contribute cash and other assets to a single underaged beneficiary. They are designed to be very flexible because individuals can use them for any purpose. But there are a few caveats to these types of accounts that parents should understand. There are no tax benefits and deposits become irrevocable as soon as they're made. If you're unsure of whether this type of account is right for your beneficiary, make sure you consult a financial professional to help guide you.
What Is a Uniform Individual Accident and Sickness Policy Provisions Act?  

A Uniform Individual Accident and Sickness Policy Provisions Act is legislation that every U.S. state has passed into law in some form. It stipulates that individual health insurance policies must contain certain provisions in order to be valid.﻿﻿





Key Takeaways

Uniform Policy Provisions are a set of mandatory and optional clauses included in health insurance policies.There are 12 mandatory and 11 optional clauses for use by insurance companies.Each state has created its version of law that provides uniform individual accident and sickness law, detailing what provisions are required and which are optional.﻿﻿


   Understanding the Uniform Individual Accident and Sickness Policy Provisions Act  

The legislation was was created to establish a standard of quality and to ensure health insurance policies have an adequate level of coverage by requiring that certain provisions be written into every policy. It was written by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC), a non-governmental organization that is comprised of the insurance commissioners of every state and territory.﻿﻿ The NAIC is not itself a regulator. Insurance markets are regulated at the state level. 


   Mandatory Uniform Policy Provisions  

The 12 mandatory provisions include the rights and obligations of both the insurer and the insured. Among the burdens that fall on the insurer are the need to include any relevant information within the original policy or official amendments, the requirement of a stated grace period for delinquent premium payments, and instructions for reinstatement of a policyholder who misses that grace period. The provisions that cover the responsibilities of the policyholder include requirements that they notify the insurer of a claim within 20 days of a loss, provide proof of the extent of that loss, and update beneficiary information when changes take place.﻿﻿


   Optional Uniform Policy Provisions  

After the 12 mandatory provisions, insurers may include any of 11 optional clauses in a policy. The policyholder and the insurer can negotiate which of these provisions will be part of the policy, but generally, the insurer will have the final say. The 11 optional provisions tend to place more of a burden on the insured to comply with certain requirements than on the insurer. These requirements include the obligation to inform the insurer of changes in income, especially if due to a disability, or changes to a more or less dangerous occupation. The optional clauses also state that any misstatements regarding age, use of illegal substances, or engagement in illegal occupations will have an adverse impact on the insured’s ability to collect on claims otherwise covered by a policy.﻿﻿
What Is the Uniform Partnership Act (UPA)?  

The Uniform Partnership Act (UPA) provides governance for business partnerships in several U.S. states. The UPA also offers regulations governing the dissolution of a partnership when a partner dissociates. Over the years, several amendments have been added to the Uniform Partnership Act (UPA). The revised act and revisions are sometimes referred to as the Revised Uniform Partnership Act (RUPA).





Key Takeaways


The Uniform Partnership Act (UPA) provides governance for business partnerships in certain U.S. states.
Approximately 44 states and districts abide by the Uniform Partnership Act (UPA).
UPA applies only to general partnerships and limited liability partnerships (LLPs).
The UPA allows for a partnership to agree to continue within 90 days after a single partner leaves the partnership. This prevents the immediate dissolution of a partnership.
Partnership creation, liabilities, assets, and fiduciary duties are also governed by the Uniform Partnership Act.



   Understanding the Uniform Partnership Act (UPA)  

The implementation of the UPA operates as a statute, which is a rule passed by legislators as opposed to government agencies. The Uniform Partnership Act was created in 1914 by the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws (NCCUSL). As of the latest iteration of the act, 44 states and districts in the U.S. abide by it, including the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The Uniform Partnership Act only applies to general liabilities and limited liability partnerships (LLPs). It does not apply to limited partnerships (LPs).



The intended goal of the Uniform Partnership Act is to provide guidance to various business relationships. This typically applies to small businesses and loose partnerships as larger businesses have detailed agreements in place that govern any changes in a business. The act governs how a partnership is created, the fiduciary duties of the partnership and its partners, and defines partnership assets and liabilities.


   Uniform Partnership Act Details  

One of the most important aspects of the UPA states that when one partner in a business leaves, a majority interest of the remaining partners can agree to continue the partnership within 90 days of the dissociation. The Uniform Partnership Act effectively saved partnerships from dissolution following a partner's dissociation.



Since the first Uniform Partnership Act was drafted in 1914, it has been revised many times, most recently in 1997. Amendments in 2011 and 2013 were added to the act to provide clarification to some of the language in the 1997 version.






Since 1892, the NCCUSL has drafted and proposed more than 250 uniform acts covering a wide range of legislation impacting everything from law, real estate, limited liability, franchise and business opportunities, and unfair trade practices.



There are currently twelve articles in the Act. Act I contains overall provisions and definitions and the scope and function of the partnership agreement. Article II focuses on the formation rules and status of the partnership. Article III contains the rules of transfer of the partnership's property, statements, and the liability of the partners in relation to debts, liabilities, and obligations.



Article IV covers the responsibilities of the partners to each other and in the partnership, including management and distribution rights, as well as highlighting loyalty, care, and good faith dealing. Article V implements the "pick your partner principle." Article VI lists the events that cause a partner to dissociate. Article VII lists the rules on purchasing a dissociated partner's interests. Article VIII deals with dissolving and winding up the partnership.



Article IX deals with principal provisions related to LLPs. Article X allows for mergers, exchanges, conversions, and domestication transactions. Article XI deals with foreign LLPs and Article XII includes miscellaneous provisions.


   Uniform Partnership Act 1997 Revision  

In 1996, the Limited Liability Partnership Amendments were promulgated and combined into the Uniform Partnership Act. In addition to the rule stating that when a partner leaves a partnership, the remaining partners have 90 days to determine if the partnership should continue or dissolve, the Uniform Partnership Act includes the following features:



A partner in a partnership can have certain interests assigned as separate liabilities in relation to the other property in the partnership, precluding them from certain rights on assets in the partnership. As such, creditors are legally only allowed to make claims on the partner as opposed to the aggregate assets in a partnership.
The duties of the partners in relation to their dealings in good faith are stipulated in the act. Such basic standards may not be abolished by any partner or partnership agreement.
It outlines standards for conversions and mergers, such as changing from a partnership to a limited partnership or merging to create a new entity.
It provides limited liability protection for general partners in a limited liability partnership.


   Uniform Partnership Act (UPA) vs. Revised Uniform Partnership Act (RUPA)  

The Uniform Partnership Act was established in 1914. It was revised in 1994, which became known as the Revised Uniform Partnership Act (RUPA). The Act was then revised again in 1996 and 1997, which was the last full revision. The 1997 version is the official version, and on the website there is no reference to RUPA. RUPA is used unofficially by certain individuals but it only adds confusion.



The Uniform Partnership Act (1997) is the official version and has been amended in 2011 and 2013.


   Special Considerations  

The role of the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws (NCCUSL)—also known as the Uniform Law Commission (ULC)—is to promote the uniformity of state laws in the United States. The ULC is a nonprofit association of more than 300 uniform law commissioners representing each state, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The ULC's law commissioners must be members of the bar; many of them are practicing lawyers, law professors, or judges.



While the ULC is responsible for researching, proposing, and drafting uniform state laws, it is up to the individual state governments to decide if they will enact the laws recommended by the ULC. The Uniform Partnership Act is just one of many uniform laws drafted by the ULC that has been widely enacted by the states. Examples of other uniform acts include the Uniform Trust Code, Uniform Anatomical Gift Act, Uniform Probate Code, Uniform Consumer Credit Code, and Uniform Transfers to Minors Act.




What Is the Difference Between UPA and RUPA?
The Uniform Partnership Act was established in 1914. In 1994, it went under certain revisions, known as the Revised Uniform Partnership Act. The Act went through further revisions in 1996 and for the last time in 1997, which is known as the Uniform Partnership Act (1997) and is the only version of the Act.




What Is a “Person” Under the Uniform Partnership Act?
A "person" under the Uniform Partnership Act "includes individuals, partnerships, limited liability companies, corporations, and other associations."




Are Partnerships Created With a Fixed Duration?
Partnerships can be created with or without a fixed duration. The partnership agreement will list the duration of the partnership. If there is a dissolution date, up until then is how long the partnership will last. If there is no fixed duration, then the partnership will exist until dissolution is decided between the partners.
What are Uniform Policy Provisions, Health Insurance?  

Uniform policy provisions refer to a set of clauses, some mandatory and some optional, that insurance companies include in written insurance policies. Each state has a uniform individual accident and sickness policy provisions law which dictates precisely the provisions that must appear in an insurance policy. In general, the state requires 12 mandatory provisions and gives the insurance company discretion to include any of 11 optional provisions when writing a policy.





Key Takeaways

Uniform Policy Provisions are a set of mandatory and optional clauses included in health insurance policies.There are 12 mandatory and 11 optional clauses for use by insurance companies.Each state has created its version of the uniform individual accident and sickness law, detailing what provisions are required and which are optional.


   Understanding Uniform Policy Provisions, Health Insurance  

Uniform policy provisions provide insurance carriers with a list of required and optional items to include when writing insurance policies. The National Association of Insurance Commissioners (NAIC) played a leading role in developing the list of provisions. Each state has implemented its own version of the uniform individual accident and sickness law, which lays out specific requirements. The states can customize their requirements as long as those adjustments do not infringe on the rights of the insured. The provisions appear in an insurance policy as a series of clauses.


   Mandatory Uniform Policy Provisions  

The 12 mandatory provisions include the rights and obligations of both the insurer and the insured. Among the burdens that fall on the insurer are the need to include any relevant information within the original policy or official amendments, the requirement of a stated grace period for delinquent premium payments, and instructions for reinstatement of a policyholder who misses that grace period. The provisions that cover the responsibilities of the policyholder include requirements that they notify the insurer of a claim within 20 days of a loss, provide proof of the extent of that loss, and update beneficiary information when changes take place.


   Optional Uniform Policy Provisions  

After the 12 mandatory provisions, insurers may include any of 11 optional clauses in a policy. The policyholder and the insurer can negotiate which of these provisions will be part of the policy, but generally, the insurer will have the final say. The 11 optional provisions tend to place more of a burden on the insured to comply with certain requirements than on the insurer. These requirements include the obligation to inform the insurer of changes in income, especially if due to a disability, or changes to a more or less dangerous occupation. The optional clauses also state that any misstatements regarding age, use of illegal substances, or engagement in illegal occupations will have an adverse impact on the insured’s ability to collect on claims otherwise covered by a policy.
What is the Uniform Premarital and Marital Agreements Act?  

Adopted by 26 states, the Uniform Premarital and Marital Agreements Act—drafted by the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws in 1983—helped bring consistency to contracts signed by two parties entering a marriage. The act allows the parties to a prenuptial agreement to choose which state's statutes for marital law will cover the agreement.﻿﻿﻿





Key Takeaways

The Uniform Premarital and Marital Agreements Act is a multi-state law enacted to determine when and how prenuptial agreements should be enforced. The act allows parties to a prenup to choose which state's marriage laws apply, in terms of items such as division of property and spousal support.The act is only enforceable if all parties to a premarital agreement enter voluntarily, and if the removal of spousal support would not make the other party reliant on government assistance.﻿﻿


   Understanding the Uniform Premarital and Marital Agreements Act  

The Uniform Premarital and Marital Agreements Act states that parties should be free to create financial terms in which they both agree—with some limitations. It makes a review of minimal standards of fairness by the state mandatory based on circumstances at the time of the agreement. After the review, a state can refuse to enforce an agreement that puts one party in financial jeopardy. The act also addresses burden of proof and establishes when rights at divorce or death might be waived or modified.﻿﻿﻿



The aim of the act is to provide courts with flexibility in making rulings on family law cases and also give individuals who are considering signing a premarital agreement some confidence that the agreement they enter into will be enforceable and how it will be enforced.



The act focuses on premarital and marital agreements (or postnuptial agreements). It treats postnuptial agreements with the same requirements and principles that it treats premarital agreements. It's important to know that some states apply different legal standards to each, including higher burdens being placed on postnuptial agreements.


   Prenups and the Uniform Premarital and Marital Agreements Act  

Most commonly, prenuptial agreements address division of property, spousal support and child custody should divorce occur. They may also include provisions for forfeiting assets in the event of adultery. Prenups are usually requested by the party that stands to lose the most money or property in the case of divorce, especially in states that follow the Community Property law﻿﻿﻿—each spouse is entitled to half of everything acquired during the marriage.



A couple can choose any state in which one of the parties lives or plans to live or the state in which the couple will be married to have a prenup enforced. Because this act has not been passed in all states, parties to a prenuptial contract are also limited to choosing only the states that have passed the Uniform Premarital and Marital Agreements Act.



The main advantage of choosing to have a prenuptial agreement fall under the jurisdiction of a state that has passed the Uniform Premarital and Marital Agreements Act is that many of these states have comprehensive provisions and statutes to resolve the issues associated with prenuptial agreements, such as estate planning, division of property, alimony, financial assets and custody. In other states, rulings on various situations may be less stable due to the fact that some states base their rulings on case law.
What Is the Uniform Prudent Investor Act (UPIA)?  

The Uniform Prudent Investor Act (UPIA) is a standard that sets out guidelines for trustees to follow when investing trust assets on behalf of a trustor. It also applies to financial professionals who make recommendations or place trades on behalf of clients. It is an update to the former "Prudent Man" standard intended to reflect the changes that have occurred in investment practice since the late 1960s.



Specifically, the Uniform Prudent Investor Act adopts a modern portfolio theory (MPT) and total return approach to the exercise of fiduciary investment and discretion.





Key Takeaways

The Uniform Prudent Investor Act (UPIA) is a statute that sets out guidelines for trustees to follow when making investments on behalf of others, an update to the Prudent Man Rule.The Prudent Man Rule stated that a trust fiduciary was required to invest trust assets as a “prudent man” would invest his own assets.The UPIA requires trustees to take into account a diversified portfolio approach that follows modern portfolio theory and a total return approach.


   Understanding the Uniform Prudent Investor Act (UPIA)  

The Uniform Prudent Investor Act was adopted in 1992 by the American Law Institute’s Third Restatement of the Law of Trusts. It was an update to the previously accepted Prudent Man Rule.



By taking the total portfolio approach and eliminating category restrictions on different types of investments, the Uniform Prudent Investor Act fostered a greater degree of diversification in investment portfolios. It also made it possible for trustees to include in their portfolios investments such as derivatives, commodities, and futures. While these investments individually have a relatively higher degree of risk, they could theoretically reduce overall portfolio risk and boost returns when considered in a total portfolio context.


   The Prudent Man Rule  

The Prudent Man Rule was based on Massachusetts common law written in 1830 and revised in 1959. It stated that a trust fiduciary was required to invest trust assets as a “prudent man” would invest his own assets, with the following in mind:



The needs of beneficiariesThe need to preserve the estateThe need for income



A prudent investment will not always turn out to be a highly profitable investment; in addition, no one can predict with certainty what will happen with any investment decision.



More recently, the prudent man rule has been renamed the prudent person rule. This set of guidelines can also be applied outside of trustee domains, where it is referred to as the prudent investor rule.


   The Uniform Prudent Investor Act’s Updates to the Rule  

The Uniform Prudent Investor Act made four main changes to the previous Prudent Man Rule standard:



A trust account's entire investment portfolio is considered when determining the prudence of an individual investment. Under the Uniform Prudent Investor Act standard, a fiduciary would not be held liable for individual investment losses so long as the investment was consistent with the overall portfolio or investment objectives.
Diversification is explicitly required as a duty for prudent fiduciary investing.
No category or type of investment is deemed inherently imprudent. Instead, suitability to the portfolio's needs is considered. As a result, investment junior lien loans, investments in limited partnerships, derivatives, futures, and similar investment vehicles are now possible. However, speculation and outright risk-taking are not sanctioned by the rule and remain subject to possible liability.
A fiduciary is permitted to delegate investment management and other functions to qualified third parties.



The Uniform Prudent Investor Act’s most important change was that the standard of prudence would henceforth be applied to any investment in the context of the total portfolio, rather than to individual investments.
What Are the Uniform Rules for Demand Guarantees (URDG)?  

The Uniform Rules for Demand Guarantees (URDG) refers to a set of international guidelines produced by the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) and adopted in 1991. These guidelines set forth generally agreed-upon rules governing securing payments and meeting performance guarantees in contracts among global trading partners.



In general, the URDG guidelines outline the rights and obligations of parties under demand guarantees. A demand guarantee is a type of protection that one party in a transaction can impose on another party in the event that the second party does not perform according to predefined specifications.



According to the ICC, many bankers, traders, and industry associations recognize and accept the URDG because it attempts to balance the interests of all parties involved in various types of international contracts.





Key Takeaways

The Uniform Rules For Demand Guarantees (URDG) refers to a set of international guidelines produced by the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) and adopted in 1991.These guidelines set forth generally agreed-upon rules governing securing payments and meeting performance guarantees in contracts among global trading partners.Bankers, traders, and industry associations recognize and accept the URDG because it attempts to balance the interests of all parties involved in various types of international contracts.



Both the World Bank and the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL) each have adopted the URDG standard.


   Understanding the Uniform Rules for Demand Guarantees (URDG)  

The URDG covers billions of dollars of contract guarantees in a number of industries, including banking and construction. 



Most commonly, the URDG covers so-called demand guarantees, which are specific rights or countermeasures one party can impose on another party if the second party does not perform according to contract specifications. 



However, the UDRG also applies to agreements requiring the decision of an arbitrator, as well as some contracts that involve slightly more complex agreements, such as situations dealing with the default of one of the parties.



The URDG works in concert with other ICC rules, such as the so-called Uniform Customs and Practice for Documentary Credits (UCP 600) as well as the Uniform Rules for Bank Payment Obligations. According to the ICC, voluntarily abiding by the URDG and its related rules helps improve the speed and volume of trade, and avoid disputes without having to go to court.﻿﻿ 



The publication "ICC Uniform Rules for Demand Guarantees Including Model Forms" is considered to be the comprehensive guide for understanding the URDG guidelines. It includes a series of ready-to-use templates and forms, rules for handling extended payments, and various checklists and best practices.



The most significant URDG update in the past three decades occurred in 2010, with the update referred to as URDG 758. This update to the original URDG rules attempted to clarify several common issues, such as those involving payment contingencies. It also provided guidance regarding the handling of specific electronic documents and fund transfers, and provided additional model forms.



The ICC worked on writing URDG 758 for more than two years prior to its release, taking into account feedback from various groups of constituents (as well as roughly 600 individual comments).﻿﻿ The new rules attempt to reduce conflicts and contract rejections. According to the ICC, the rules included in URDG 758 are intended to bring financial stability to international markets, adds new definitions and rules interpretations, and provides guidance for the treatment of “contentious practices.”﻿﻿
What Is the Uniform Securities Act?  

The Uniform Securities Act is a model law created as a starting point for state-level securities regulation. The purpose of the Uniform Securities Act is to deal with securities fraud at the state level and to assist the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in enforcement and regulation.


   Uniform Securities Act Explained  

Because not all investments are covered federally and not all investment dealers are registered at the federal level, the SEC cannot protect all investors and pursue all security violations. This created the need for state-level regulations such as the Uniform Securities Act to further protect investors. Each state has its own security laws colloquially referred to as the “blue sky laws.”


   How the Uniform Securities Act Is Applied  

The Uniform Securities Act is a framework that guides states in the crafting of their own securities legislation. The act evolved through a series of amendments due to earlier regulations not being adopting consistently across the country. Some jurisdictions did not enact each securities act introduced by the Uniform Law Commissioners. Through subsequent revisions and replacements of prior regulations, the Uniform Securities Act brought more parity to the federal and state implementation of securities protections.﻿﻿



One of the issues with regulating securities from two different levels of government is the potential for duplication. The Uniform Securities Act outlines the authority and role of state and federal regulators in dealing with securities fraud.﻿﻿ For example, many fraudulent acts occur at the local level with pyramid schemes and other scams. That means enforcement through state law is necessary to address such crimes.



The act provides more structure and consistency in enforcement authority across states as well as in coordination with federal authority regarding the prosecution of securities fraud.



The intent of securities regulations, whether at the state or federal levels, is to prevent the fraudulent sale of securities to investors. Regulatory efforts stem from three primary elements. Registration is required for initial public offerings. Those who deal in securities, specifically investment advisers, broker-dealers, and their representatives and agents, must also be registered. In order to prohibit and prevent securities fraud, regulatory agencies must also have enforcement authority to address such actions. That includes being granted the ability to establish regulations and rules on securities transactions and having the capacity to bring the prosecution of criminal and civil violations to court.﻿﻿



The Uniform Securities Act serves as structure that includes state-level authority to take action on these issues.
What Is the Uniform Simultaneous Death Act?  

The term Uniform Simultaneous Death Act refers to a law used in some states to determine inheritance in cases where two or more people die around the same time. According to the act, the assets of two or more people who have no will and die within a 120-hour period can be passed down to their relatives rather than from one estate to another. This act is used to avoid double administrative costs.﻿﻿





Key Takeaways

The Uniform Simultaneous Death Act is a law used in some states to determine inheritance in cases where two or more people die around the same time.The assets of two or more people who die within a 120-hour period without a will can be passed down to their relatives rather than from one estate to another.The act eliminates any double administrative costs.Without the law, two probates would be needed to process the transfer of estates before the assets are distributed.


   How the Uniform Simultaneous Death Act Works  

The Uniform Simultaneous Death Act was first enacted in 1940 and has been revised in subsequent years. Most states adopted the law in the U.S., while only 21 states and the District of Columbia have enacted the revised version, which was updated to include certain provisions in 1993. One of these amendments allowed the law to be applied to individuals who are missing for at least five years, in the event that a body can't be located and the person is presumed dead.



Someone who dies without leaving a will is said to be intestate. When someone dies in intestacy, it's up to a probate court to decide how the estate is administered. The Uniform Simultaneous Death Act helps heirs avoid this step by clarifying issues surrounding inheritance when two or more people die without leaving wills.



Here's how it works. Let's say a couple are involved in a plane crash. If one is pronounced dead at the scene and the other dies a day later, the Uniform Simultaneous Death Act goes into effect. In this case, the assets are combined and distributed to the relatives of both individuals equally, rather than transferring all the assets first to the estate of the wife and then to all of her relatives.



Without the law, two probates would be necessary to process the transfer of estates before the assets are distributed. Probate is the general process used to administer the will of a deceased person or the estate of an individual who doesn't leave a will behind. Probate costs can be rather high, deflating the value of an inheritance when the estates of two spouses are involved. The Uniform Simultaneous Death Act helps cut down the administrative costs related to the probate process.


   Special Considerations  

It is possible that a person’s will contains language that alters or eliminates the application of the Uniform Simultaneous Death Act. As such, clauses in the act such as the 120-hour survival period requirement may be waived under a variety of conditions. If a will, deed, trust, insurance policy, or other governing instruments include language that expressly addresses simultaneous deaths or deaths in a common incident, the provisions from that document would go into effect.﻿﻿ For example, an individual’s last will and testament may specifically detail how to direct the release of particular assets in the event of a simultaneous death with their spouse, or if their deaths occur within a set time frame of each other.






The 120-hour waiting period may be waived if there are any governing documents discuss simultaneous deaths or if its application has adverse effects.﻿﻿



The required 120-hour survival period as prescribed by the act may also be ignored if its application has adverse effects. This includes instances involving an unintended failure or duplication of a disposition. Survival, however, must still be established with convincing and clear evidence.﻿﻿


   Uniform Simultaneous Death Act vs. Uniform Probate Code  

While 21 states and the District of Columbia have adopted the Uniform Simultaneous Death Act as law, others have enacted all or parts of the Uniform Probate Code as law.﻿﻿ This code governs inheritance and the estates of deceased parties by providing uniformity to the probate process. The UPC was first promulgate in 1969.﻿﻿ The code is made up of several articles that cover issues surrounding the death of individuals without a will, the probate of wills, how to administer estates, nonprobate property transfers, and other related topics.
What Is a Uniform Transfer Tax?  

A uniform transfer tax is the combination of federal estate taxes and federal gift taxes into a single tax.





Key Takeaways

A uniform transfer tax merges federal gift and estate taxes into a single tax.The term uniform transfer tax also refers to assets transferred from one individual to another without receiving anything or receiving less than market value in return.Transfer taxes are usually nondeductible on tax returns.The uniform tax credit can be used by taxpayers to reduce their estate taxes and probate costs by forgoing gift tax deductions during their lifetime.


   Understanding a Uniform Transfer Tax  

A uniform transfer tax covers the transfer of assets from the death of one individual to their chosen beneficiary. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) imposes estate taxes on assets left to heirs, but the law does not apply to the transfer of assets to a surviving spouse.



The term uniform transfer tax refers to assets transferred from one individual to another without receiving anything or receiving less than market value in return. It is the combination of both these taxes that creates the uniform transfer tax.



The uniform transfer tax is a kind of transfer tax, which means it is a kind of tax levied on the transfer of ownership or title to property from one entity to another. The Internal Revenue Service oversees the regulations of the uniform transfer tax. Transfer taxes are usually nondeductible on tax returns.


   Components of the Uniform Transfer Tax  
  Gift Tax  

The uniform transfer tax combines elements of the federal gift tax and the federal estate tax. The federal gift tax applies to transfers made while a person is living and is 40% over a certain amount that's given to one recipient within the year. That amount is $16,000 in 2022, rising to $17,000 in 2023.






The gift tax applies to the giver of the gift, not the individual receiving it. For an asset or amount to be considered a gift the receiving party cannot pay the giver the full value of the gift.



The gift tax excludes gifts to one's spouse, gifts to a political organization for use by the political organization, gifts that are valued at less than the annual gift tax exclusion for a given year, and medical and educational expenses.


  Estate Tax  

The other half of the uniform transfer tax is the estate tax, which is a tax levied on an heir's inherited portion of an estate. This estate tax only applies if the value of the estate exceeds the exclusion limit set by law. That act is referred to as an unlimited marital deduction.



For 2022, the IRS requires estates exceeding $12.06 million to file a federal estate tax return and pay estate taxes. This means that an estate of $11 million does not need to file an estate tax return. In 2023, the threshold rises to $12.92 million.


   Uniform Transfer Tax and Probate  

Since the probate process can be expensive, some people would rather use the unified transfer tax to save on estate taxes after their deaths. This is done via the uniform tax credit, which integrates both the gift and estate tax credits into one tax system. It is a tax credit that decreases the tax bill of the individual or estate, dollar to dollar.



An individual or couple that plans to gift some of their assets to someone may need to file a gift tax return if the value of the assets is higher than the annual exemption amount. Gifts made to charities or to pay another person's medical or tuition expenses are exempt from gift tax return requirements.



This means that the credit will not be used for reducing gift taxes while a person is still alive, but will instead be used on the inheritance amount bequeathed to beneficiaries after death. To take advantage of this lifetime credit, beneficiaries or the decedent’s estate executor must complete IRS Form 706, which is used to figure the estate tax imposed by Chapter 11 of the Internal Revenue Code (IRC).



The unified tax credit can be used by taxpayers either before or after death. It is important to keep up to date on it as the tax credit changes frequently.


   The Bottom Line  

A uniform transfer tax merges federal gift and estate taxes into a single tax and is a kind of transfer tax, levied on the transfer of ownership or title to property from one entity to another. Both gift and estate tax exclusions amounts are established by the IRS each year. In 2023, the annual gift tax exclusion amount is $17,000 and $12.92 million for estates of decedents who die during 2023.
What Is the Uniform Transfers to Minors Act (UTMA)?  

The term Uniform Transfers to Minors Act (UTMA) refers to a law that allows a minor to receive gifts without the aid of a guardian or trustee. Gifts can include money, patents, royalties, real estate, and fine art.



A UTMA account allows the gift giver or an appointed custodian to manage the minor's account until the latter is of age. It also shields the minor from tax consequences on the gifts, up to a specified value.





Key Takeaways

The Uniform Transfers to Minors Act (UTMA) allows a minor to receive gifts without the aid of a guardian or trustee.The law is an extension of the Uniform Gift to Minors Act.The minor named in the UTMA can avoid tax consequences until they attain legal age for the state in which the account is set up.The donor can name a custodian, who has the fiduciary duty to manage and invest the property on behalf of the minor until they become of legal age.It is up to individual states to adopt or amend the UTMA for its residents.


   Understanding the Uniform Transfers to Minors Act (UTMA)  

The UTMA is similar to the original version of the Uniform Gift to Minors Act (UGMA). It allows minors to receive gifts and avoid tax consequences until they become of legal age in the state in which they live—typically 18 or 21 years of age. The UTMA incorporates the language of the UGMA and extends the original definition of gifts beyond cash and securities to include real estate, paintings, royalties, and patents.



The UTMA provides a convenient way for children to save and invest without carrying the tax burden. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) allows for an exclusion from the gift tax of up to $16,000 per person for 2022 ($17,000 for 2023) for a qualifying gift, including gifts to minors.



The minor’s Social Security number (SSN) is used for tax reporting purposes on UTMA accounts. Because assets held in a UTMA account are owned by the minor, this may have a negative impact when the minor applies for financial aid or scholarships.



Each state has the option to adopt or amend the UTMA for its residents. For example, Florida passed a statute in 2015 that allows any property to be held by the UTMA custodian until the minor is 25 if desired.






Any earnings that are generated within a UTMA are taxed at the kiddie tax rate by the IRS up to the allotted threshold of $2,200. Earnings after that are taxed at the adult donor's marginal tax rate.


   Special Considerations  

The UTMA allows the donor to name a custodian, who has the fiduciary duty to manage and invest the property on behalf of the minor until that minor becomes of legal age. The property belongs to the minor from the time the property is gifted. If the donor dies while serving as custodian, the value of the custodianship property is included in the donor’s estate.






The assets in a UTMA are counted as part of the donor's taxable estate until the minor takes possession.


   Uniform Transfers to Minors Act (UTMA) vs. Uniform Gift to Minors Act (UGMA)  

As noted above, the UTMA is just like an earlier version of the UGMA. In fact, it is an extension of the UGMA. The latter was developed in 1956 and revised in 1966. It was limited to the transfer of securities and was finalized in 1986 by the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws and adopted by most of the 50 states.



The UGMA provides a way to transfer property to a minor without the need for a formal trust. It allows assets or other property to be managed by a custodian who is appointed by the donor. The property is then turned over to the minor when they become of legal age in the state where the gift was made. As noted above, there are many types of property that can be transferred to minors, including:



Cash
Stocks and bonds
Patents
Royalties
Real estate
Fine art
Mutual funds and other investments
Intellectual property



Contributions to a UGMA are made using after-tax dollars, which means donors don't receive a tax deduction for making them. Just like a UTMA, gifts made to a UGMA are tax-free up to $16,000 per person for 2022 and $17,000 per person for 2023.




Can a Minor Receive Gifts or Assets Without a Guardian or Trustee?
Yes, a minor can receive gifts or assets without a guardian or trustee as it is stipulated in the Uniform Transfers to Minors Act. The UTMA is a law that governs the transfer of assets from adults to minors. it provides parents and other adults with a tax-advantaged way to pass on gifts to minors without needing to create a formal trust. In doing so, the adult who donates the gift would typically act as the custodian for those assets until the minor reaches legal age. Alternatively, the donor can also appoint a third party to serve as the custodian of those assets.




What Is the Difference Between the UTMA and the Uniform Gift to Minors Act (UGMA)?
The UTMA and the UGMA serve similar purposes, but there are important differences between them. Most notably, the UTMA allows for a broader range of assets to be gifted, including financial securities such as stocks and bonds.The UTMA also provides additional time for the assets being gifted to reach their maturity dates, such as in the case of a bond. By contrast, the UGMA requires the assets to be assumed by the minor once the minor reaches 18 years of age.




What Are the Pros and Cons of Using a UTMA Account?
The main advantage of using a UTMA account is that the money contributed to the account is exempted from paying a gift tax of up to a maximum of $16,000 per year for 2022 ($17,000 for 2023). Any income earned on the contributed funds is taxed at the tax rate of the minor who is being gifted the funds. Since the minor’s income is presumably significantly lower than that of the adult donor, this can lead to significant tax savings.One of the drawbacks of using a UTMA account, however, is that it can make the recipient less eligible for need-based college scholarship programs and other such initiatives.




When Can a Child Claim Ownership of an UTMA Account?
Depending on the state a UTMA account is handed over to a child when they reach either age 18 or age 21. In some jurisdictions, at age 18 a UTMA account can only be handed over with the custodian's permission, and at 21 is transferred automatically. Enquire with the bank or brokerage where the UTMA is housed for clarification.
What Is a Unilateral Contract?  

A unilateral contract is a one-sided contract agreement in which an offeror promises to pay only after the completion of a task by the offeree. In this type of agreement, the offeror is the only party with a contractual obligation. A unilateral contract differs from a bilateral contract in which both parties are bound by the agreement.





Key Takeaways

Unilateral contracts are one-sided, requiring only a commitment from the offeror.Unilateral contracts do not require the offeree to perform the requested task or act.Unilateral contracts are usually used to make optional offers.Bilateral contracts require an agreement between two parties and obligation on both sides.


   Understanding Unilateral Contracts  

Unilateral contracts occur when the offeror makes an offer to another party. This type of contract requires the offeree to perform an act that the offeror requests. The offeree has no obligation to complete the task and the offeror will only pay if the request is completed.



Unilateral contracts are considered enforceable by contract law, however, legal action is not commonly pursued unless the offeree claims to be eligible for remuneration tied to the request.



Contract breach depends on whether or not the terms of the contract were clear and if it can be proven that the offeree is eligible for payment of specified acts based on the unilateral contract’s provisions.


   Types of Unilateral Contracts  

Unilateral contracts are primarily one-sided without obligation from the offeree. Open requests and insurance policies are two of the most common types of unilateral contracts.


  Open Requests  

Offerors may use unilateral contracts to make a broad or optional request and payment is made only when certain specifications are met. If an offeree completes the task, the offeror is required to pay.



Rewards are a common type of unilateral contract request where information received may lead to a criminal's conviction that will warrant a payment. Funds can be paid to a single individual or several individuals offering information that serves this specific purpose.



A unilateral contract is commonly used with a request for labor. An individual may offer to pay someone to clean their house or walk their dog and the offeree is paid only when the task is completed.


  Insurance  

Insurance policies have unilateral contract characteristics since the insurer promises to pay if certain acts occur under the terms of a contract’s coverage. In an insurance contract, the offeree pays a premium specified by the insurer to maintain the plan and receive coverage if a specific event occurs.


   The 4 Elements of a Unilateral Contract  

To make a unilateral contract legally binding, four elements must exist:


  Agreement  

One party makes an offer to another party and both must accept the offer, without coercion or force from either side.


  Consideration  

Consideration is the price paid for the promise or agreement and it does not need to be a monetary payment. Consideration can be any type of property or holding that both parties agree to warrant acceptable payment.


  Intention  

Both parties must have the full intention to create a binding contract and understand the terms and conditions of the agreement.


  Certainty  

Both parties must fully understand what must happen to complete the terms of the contract. In a unilateral contract, an action or task will need to be completed for the contract to be fulfilled.


   Unilateral Contracts vs. Bilateral Contracts  

Contracts can be unilateral or bilateral. In a unilateral contract, only the offeror has an obligation. The offeree is not required to complete the task or action.



In a bilateral contract, both parties agree to an obligation and involve equal obligation from the offeror and the offeree. In general, the primary distinction between unilateral and bilateral contracts is the amount of reciprocal obligation from both parties.




How Do You Know If a Contract Is Unilateral?
A unilateral contract does not obligate the offeree to accept the offeror's request and there is no requirement to complete the task. A bilateral contract, however, contains firm agreements and promises between two parties.




Can You Break a Unilateral Contract?
In a unilateral contract, the offeror may revoke the offer before the offeree's performance begins and this change should be expressed to the offeree before any task is started.




Are Unilateral Contract Mistakes Enforceable?
If a mistake occurs during a unilateral contract, some remedies for a mistake include contract reform where the contract is changed or a new contract is started, or full contract cancellation.


   The Bottom Line  

In a unilateral contract, the offeror is the only party with a contractual obligation. The offeror will pay for a specific task or activity only if it is completed by the offeree. A unilateral contract differs from a bilateral contract in which both parties are bound by the agreement.
What Is a Unilateral Transfer?  

A unilateral transfer is a one-way transfer of money, goods, or services from one party to another. It is often used to describe payments made by a government to their citizens, or from one country to another country in the form of foreign aid. In these cases, the supplier of funds receives nothing in return from the recipient. A unilateral transfer differs from a bilateral transfer, such as bilateral trade, which involves reciprocal economic benefit for both parties to a transaction.





Key Takeaways

Unilateral transfers involve sending funds, goods, or services to a receiving party, who does not return anything in kind.Unilateral transfers are common in countries directing foreign aid, often from developed to less-developed nations.On the surface, unilateral aid programs are designed to spread economic growth, development, and democracy. In reality, many are given strategically as diplomatic tools or handsome contracts to well-connected businesses.Critics argue direct aid to foreign governments can be misused for corrupt or oppressive purposes.


   Understanding Unilateral Transfers  

Unilateral transfers occur frequently as gifts in everyday life. This can be contrasted with bilateral transfers, a mutual exchange of goods, money, or services. A birthday gift or wedding present are examples where nothing is expected in return.



Donations to charities or other forms of philanthropy can also be construed as a unilateral transfer, although some such donations may receive tax benefits. Governments may hand out unilateral transfers in the form of economic stimulus, for instance, in the checks sent to American families during the financial crisis in early 2020.



Unilateral transfers sent by governments are included in the current account of a nation's balance of payments. They are distinct from trade transactions, which are bilateral in that both parties receive something. Unilateral transfers encompass things such as humanitarian aid and payments made by immigrants to their native countries.



Unilateral transfers are thus often involved in instances of direct foreign aid. Unilateral aid occurs when one government directly transfers money or other assets to a recipient country. Critics have argued, however, that direct foreign aid can be problematic and lead to negative unintended consequences.



For instance, direct cash sent to Africa has been "an unmitigated economic, political, and humanitarian disaster," as written by Zambian-born economist and World Bank consultant Dambisa Moyo in her book Dead Aid: Why Aid Is Not Working and How There Is a Better Way to Help Africa. Foreign governments are often corrupt and use foreign aid money to bolster their military control or to create propaganda-style education programs instead of using it to help their population.


   Unilateral Transfer Example  

The economic stimulus provided to citizens during the COVID-19 pandemic, in the form of direct payments to households, constitutes a unilateral payment, in that the government provided funds with no expectations of receiving something in return. Indirectly, the expectation was that the payments would help bolster the economy by sparking more consumer spending. However, there was no expectation or requirement for any repayment. The U.S. government spent an estimated $817 billion on three rounds of payments between March 2020 and March 2021.




Is Foreign Aid a Unilateral Transfer?
Some foreign aid is considered to be a unilateral transfer, such as when the U.S. or another nation provides humanitarian support to a nation without expectation of anything in return. But some forms of foreign aid are bilateral, such as when a country provides military aid in exchange for certain agreements of cooperation or allyship. 




What Are Different Types of Unilateral Transfers?
A nation providing humanitarian or military aid can constitute a unilateral transfer. On an individual level, a gift, a donation, or any other form of aid without expected reciprocation is also considered to be a unilateral transfer.




What Is a Unilateral Contract?
A unilateral contract is a one-sided agreement in which the party making the offer agrees to pay only after the party that accepts the offer has completed a task. This differs from a bilateral contract in which both parties must abide by the agreement. 


   The Bottom Line  

A unilateral transfer is a type of payment or aid from one party to another that doesn't require anything in return. A government can make a unilateral transfer to its citizens, in the form of economic stimulus, or social security, or to another country in the form of humanitarian or military aid. A person or organization can make a gift, donation or other form of support to an individual with no expectation of reciprocation, constituting a unilateral transfer.
What Is an Uninsurable Peril?  

Uninsurable perils are events for which insurance coverage is not available or for which insurers are unlikely to underwrite policies.



An uninsurable peril is typically an event that has a high risk of occurrence, meaning the probability of a payout is high and expected. Perils that insurers are unwilling to cover are often catastrophic in nature.





Key Takeaways

Uninsurable perils are events for which insurance coverage is not available or for which insurers are unlikely to underwrite policies.An uninsurable peril is typically an event with a high risk of occurrence.Perils that insurers are unwilling to cover are often catastrophic in nature, for which the probability of a payout is high and expected. The major areas for which insurance is unobtainable include reputational risk, regulatory risk, trade secret risk, political risk, and pandemic risk.


   Understanding Uninsurable Perils  

Uninsurable peril risk is relatively widespread across the human experience. An example of an uninsurable peril might be if an individual builds a home in a known flood area.



Because the area has a history of that particular peril, it is unlikely an insurance company will want to extend flood coverage because of the difficulty in managing the potential risk. That sort of difficulty managing the risk is the primary reason why flood insurance exists as a government program managed by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) instead of as a subset of private insurance.


   Types of Uninsurable Perils  

While in no way a complete list, the major areas where insurance is unobtainable include reputational risk, regulatory risk, trade secret risk, political risk, and pandemic risk.


  Reputational Risk  

Reputational risk occurs when a company does something, or something happens to a company, that damages its public image to the point where its business is imperiled. For example, a CEO is involved in a sexual harassment scandal, or someone is randomly placing poison in bottles of a company's product.



There may be some coverage (for product recall expenses, for example). But generally, these situations cannot be insured because an insurer cannot determine what the risk is and what it's worth.


  Regulatory Risk  

Regulatory risk is the possibility a government agency will do something, or a government will pass a law, that severely damages a business. For example, forcing coal-powered electric generators to close.



Thousands of new rules and laws are posted at the state, local, and federal levels every year. It's impossible for an insurer to anticipate these or write a policy to mitigate the damage to a company stemming from them.


  Trade Secrets  

Trade secrets are essential to many companies, yet if they are exposed or stolen the damage is hard to calculate. A hacker can steal key computer code. A disgruntled employee can walk off with secret formulas or processes.



Predicting how likely this is to happen or the amount of damage is beyond the ability and scope of most insurers.


  Political Risk  

Political risks such as government expropriation of an asset, war or political violence, credit default of trade receivables, or when foreign governments block transfer of currency and assets, are difficult to insure against because they are so unpredictable.


  Pandemic Risk  

Extreme levels of unpredictability are also expected with pandemics. The effects of mass illnesses can vary widely. The pandemic-level flu H1N1 disrupted some businesses, but the viral infection COVID-19 profoundly disrupted the world economy. Because of the unpredictability, scale, and cost involved in pandemic situations, private insurance can't help most people or businesses.
What Is Uninsurable Property?  

Uninsurable property is a home that is not eligible for insurance through the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) because it is in need of extensive repairs. An uninsurable property is typically ineligible for a mortgage through the FHA; however, in certain cases, the individual purchasing the home may qualify for alternative FHA financing options.﻿﻿﻿



More generally, uninsurable property may refer to any real estate or other personal property that an insurer decides not to cover.





Key Takeaways

In the housing market, an uninsurable property is one that the FHA refuses to insure.Most often, this is due to the home being in unlivable condition and/or needing extensive repairs.While the FHA will not insure such homes, private insurance companies may, but will typically come with higher premiums due to the property's added risk.


   Understanding Uninsurable Property  

The insurance and mortgages offered through FHA come with certain requirements on the condition of the property in the transaction. If the repairs required to meet those requirements are more than the limit set by the FHA, the property will not be accepted into the program. Repairs on housing may be necessary because of damage from fires, storms, or age that has made parts of the property fall below standards.﻿﻿


   How Uninsurable Property Is Treated by Private Sector Insurers  

Other insurers aside from FHA might not insure a property because of specific items that must be tended to, such as trees that are dead or pose a risk of collapse on the property and need to be removed. Exposed and outdated wiring, as well as other infrastructure issues could cause an insurer to deny coverage. The presence of a swimming pool could pose an issue that insurers may not want to cover, unless the property includes certain features such as a fence to enclose and secure the pool from outsiders.



When a home is inspected in conjunction with a sale, an inspector will assess the property but it may still be necessary to ask direct questions about the insurability of the housing along with any issues that stand out. If a homebuyer does not remain attentive to such problematic possibilities, they may be caught in a deal for a property they cannot secure insurance for. If the property owner plans to make repairs to come into compliance, there may be policies available that cover the presence of workers who will be on the property to make those repairs.



Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) homes must be appraised and inspected before they can be listed for bidding. The homes typically fall into one of three categories: insurable, insurable with repair escrow or uninsurable. Any HUD home that is uninsurable will generally have to secure other-than-FHA financing. In certain instances, however, HUD will provide financing for the purchase of an uninsurable property through its FHA 203K loan financing program. These are rehab mortgages where the lender rolls the repairs costs into the mortgage. These homes usually sell at a large discount and are not offered through conventional financing because of their condition.﻿﻿
What Is Uninsurable Risk?  

Uninsurable risk is a condition that poses an unknowable or unacceptable risk of loss or a situation in which the insurance would be against the law. Insurance companies limit their losses by not taking on certain risks that are very likely to result in a loss. Many states offer insurance for otherwise uninsurable risks through their "high-risk pools." However, lifetime benefits may be capped, and premiums may be expensive.





Key Takeaways

Uninsurable risk is a condition that poses an unknowable or unacceptable risk of loss for an insurance company to cover.An uninsurable risk could include a situation in which insurance is against the law, such as coverage for criminal penalties.An uninsurable risk can be an event that's too likely to occur, such as a hurricane or flood, in an area where those disasters are frequent.High-risk coverage is available from some insurance companies, but the coverage could be limited and expensive.


   Understanding Uninsurable Risk  

Many people buy insurance even though there's a low probability that the insured will need the policy. Young adults, for example, might buy life insurance or health insurance through their employers despite the unlikelihood of needing the coverage for many years. Others who are at higher risk also buy the insurance, and both groups pay their monthly premiums to the insurance company.



Insurance companies practice a policy called risk pooling, which is the collection of the premiums from those who are less likely to need the insurance (called low-risk) and those who are more likely to need the insurance (called high-risk). By grouping a large number of people together in a pool, the low-risk individuals essentially pay (through their premiums) for the cost of the high-risk individuals. If an insurance company covered uninsurable risks, there would likely be an increase in payouts for insurance claims reducing the funds in the insurance pool. As a result, uninsurable risks are not included in standard insurance coverage packages. For insurance to work, most of the group has to go without a loss. Otherwise, the insurance company runs out of money.



A risk is insurable when the risk is considered calculable and can be measured and tracked by actuaries who study data and probabilities for insurance companies. If a river floods 800 times in a century, the flood is an insurable risk. However, the insurer can't insure against a marriage failing. With so many factors, there's no way an actuary could reasonably calculate a definitive probability of success or failure. That's the essence of uninsurable risk.



High-risk coverage is available from some insurance companies, and people with uninsurable risks might be able to get some level of coverage this way, but coverage will likely be limited and premiums more expensive. Some governments offer insurance coverage when regular commercial insurance markets can't accept the risk. Government flood insurance, for instance, is available in high-risk areas because regular insurance companies won't write the policies.


   Special Considerations  

Calling a risk uninsurable is not a simple conclusion to make. Some risks are clearly uninsurable because of the law, such as coverage for criminal fines and penalties since the law forbids such coverage. However, there isn't really a conclusive comprehensive list of all the uninsurable risks out there. Part of the job of corporate risk managers is to identify their organizational exposures as best they can and then work to manage or eliminate those risks. Sometimes, commercial insurance can be used to remove the bulk of that risk, but it's not always possible. 


   Examples of Uninsurable Risks  

Although each insurance company may have its own policies regarding what they consider insurable and uninsurable, below are examples of risks that might be considered uninsurable by many companies.


  Too Likely to Occur  

If an insurance company considers an event, such as a natural disaster or a catastrophe, to be too likely to occur, the event will likely be uninsurable. 



If a home, for example, is situated on the coast where there are frequent hurricanes and damage to properties, insurance companies might consider the risk of damage too likely to occur. As a result, the risk would be uninsurable, meaning insurance companies wouldn't provide any coverage caused by that particular uninsurable event. 



Homes that are located in flood zones or in areas where there are frequent landslides might also be considered uninsurable risks to insurance companies. Individuals and homeowners would likely need to seek help from the government or an insurance company that provides high-risk coverage. 


  Risk to Reputation  

A company can experience damage to its reputation. For example, a recall of a company's products due to safety hazards could damage the company's name and reputation. An insurance company would face a difficult challenge in determining a monetary value of a company's reputation in order to insure that amount. There are too many factors and variables involved for an insurer to value the reputation of one company versus another, and too many things could go wrong.


  Regulatory Risk  

Regulations are laws issued by government agencies designed to protect its citizens from wrongful actions by corporations or other parties. Regulations can change frequently, and many businesses struggle to keep up with the dynamic regulatory landscape. Examples of regulations include new laws to protect the environment or changes in food safety laws on how food should be processed. Insurance companies would have a difficult task in predicting the probability of regulatory changes and assigning a monetary value to the damage caused to a company as a result of that change.


  Trade Secret Risk  

Trade secret risk can involve national security when a government employee takes information from a computer. The risk can also occur in companies when an employee might take a client list home and offer it to the competition in exchange for a job. Companies would have difficulty finding an insurer that would cover the damage if its trade secrets were stolen or given out.


  Political Risk  

Multinational corporations face challenges when they open up operations overseas. Companies that are located developing nations may experience political risk, such as political upheaval if the government is overthrown or collapses. Developing nations often do not have the financial stability of developed countries, and as a result, can default or not pay its financial obligations. A nationwide default might include the inability to pay for public services or a country being unable to pay its national debt. Insurance companies would not be able to forecast the likelihood of a political event occurring and the cost of insuring that event would likely be prohibitive.


  Pandemic Risk   

A pandemic is an outbreak of a disease that spreads over an entire country or over the whole world. The risk of a pandemic are nearly impossible for insurance companies to predict and estimate the damages that could be caused to individuals and corporations. Businesses might be able to use other insurance policies to recoup some of the costs of a pandemic. For example, a company might have insurance that covers stoppages in their supply chain, such as being unable to buy raw materials or inventory.



As with the other uninsurable risks, there are some insurance companies willing to cover the risks associated with a pandemic. However, there could be limits to the coverage within those policies and hefty premiums.
What Is an Uninsured Certificate of Deposit?  

An uninsured certificate of deposit is a CD that is not insured against losses. Due to the lack of insurance, these CDs yield a higher interest rate, as the purchaser assumes all of the risks. If the financial institution or entity that issued the CD goes bankrupt, then the purchaser loses the investment.





Key Takeaways


An uninsured certificate of deposit is a CD that is not insured against losses by either the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. (FDIC) or the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA).
Uninsured CDs typically have higher interest rates because the purchaser of the CD assumes all of the risk associated with them.
Examples of uninsured CDs are Yankee CDs, bull CDs, and bear CDs.
Most CDs are insured by the FDIC or the NCUA.
CDs, along with savings accounts and money market accounts, are savings vehicles that you can invest in at your local bank or credit union.



   Understanding Uninsured CDs  

Most CDs are insured by either the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. (FDIC) or, in the case of credit unions, the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA). These institutions would pay CD holders up to a certain limit in the event that the lending financial institution was insolvent. However, there are uninsured CDs, such as offshore CDs and brokered CDs.






Offshore CDs put your money in a foreign institution’s bank certificate. The lure is interest rates that are a multiple of what you can get on a similar investment in the United States. However, the danger is betting on the safety of a foreign bank, and if your money is kept in that country’s currency rather than in U.S. dollars, you are exposed to currency risk.


   Special Considerations  

An FDIC-insured account is a bank or thrift (savings and loan association) account that meets the requirements to be covered by the FDIC. The type of accounts that can be FDIC-insured includes negotiable order of withdrawal (NOW), checking, savings, money market deposit accounts, and CDs. The maximum amount insured in a qualified account is $250,000 per depositor, per member institution. This means if you have up to that amount in a bank account and the bank fails, then the FDIC makes you whole from any losses that you suffered.



Other categories of CDs are exotics that are put together by investment companies. Investors in search of yield sometimes buy these without realizing that they are not government-guaranteed. They may have high teaser rates, long lock-up periods, variable rates, rates of return tied to indexes like the stock or bond markets, or even variable rates tied to an asset that has no publicly revealed price.



Some brokered CDs may be partly uninsured. Other forms of CDs are the bull CD, bear CD, and Yankee CD. The bull CD’s interest rate correlates directly with the value of its underlying market index. When someone invests in a bull CD, they are guaranteed a minimum rate of return and an additional specified percentage, based on the associated market index. The interest rate that a holder of a bull CD receives during the life of the CD increases as the value of the market index increases.




Is it safe to invest in an uninsured certificate of deposit (CD)?
There are risks involved with an uninsured certificate of deposit (CD). Investors put their money at risk all the time in uninsured options like mutual funds, annuities, life insurance policies, stocks, and bonds. Each individual has to decide if the higher interest rates are worth the risk.




What are the benefits of an uninsured CD?
While an uninsured CD carries risk, the biggest benefit is that you can earn more money. Higher interest rates over time will bring in a much higher rate of return. If you are confident in the market, an uninsured CD could make sense for you.




Are CDs insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. (FDIC)?
The majority of CDs are provided through banks or credit unions, and these bank options are insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. (FDIC) for up to $250,000. The National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) provides similar protection for credit union options. There are uninsured options, typically offered through a brokerage. These options include offshore CDs, bull CDs, bear CDs, and Yankee CDs.
What Is Uninsured Motorist Coverage (UM)?  

Uninsured motorist (UM) coverage is a component of an auto insurance policy that provides coverage when the policyholder is in an accident with someone who does not have insurance. It is an add-on to a standard auto policy and pays for injuries to the policyholder and passengers, and in some instances for damage to property, if the other driver is legally responsible for the accident but uninsured. In some states, it is required that auto insurance policies include uninsured motorist coverage.﻿





Key Takeaways

Uninsured motorist coverage (UM) is an add-on coverage for auto policies that will pay for injuries and damages caused by an uninsured driver.Hit-and-run drivers are also considered uninsured motorists.Uninsured motorist coverage usually adds only a small cost to an auto insurance policy but provides beneficial coverage.


   Understanding Uninsured Motorist Coverage (UM)  

An uninsured motorist (UM) is an at-fault driver who has no auto insurance, does not have insurance that meets state-required minimum liability amounts, or whose insurance company is unwilling or unable to pay the claim. A hit-and-run driver would also be considered an uninsured motorist. If you are in an accident with an uninsured motorist and do not have uninsured motorist coverage, you may not receive payments, even if the other person is at fault.


   How Uninsured Motorist Coverage Works  

State laws generally mandate that motorists carry some level of automobile liability insurance coverage, and these requirements vary from state to state. Nineteen states plus Washington D.C. require that policies include uninsured motorist (UM) coverage. New Hampshire and Virginia are the only U.S. states that do not require a minimum amount of auto insurance coverage.



Despite these mandates, one in every eight U. S. drivers on the road does not have insurance, reports the Insurance Research Council. The organization's latest report on this subject found that Florida had the highest number of uninsured drivers at 26.7%, followed by Mississippi, New Mexico, Michigan, and Tennessee. The state with the lowest number of uninsured motorists is Maine with 4.5%



Uninsured motorist coverage is designed to protect you against financial losses stemming from an accident in which the other driver lacks adequate coverage. If you are involved in an accident and the other driver is at fault, you'd file a claim with that driver's insurance company. If the claim is successful, you could use the proceeds to repair your car or pay for medical bills associated with injuries from the accident.



In cases where the driver lacks sufficient coverage or any type of car insurance at all, having uninsured motorist coverage can minimize anything you might have to pay toward vehicle repairs or medical bills. Again, this may be optional, depending on where you live but having this coverage could offer some reassurance if you're involved in an accident.






There are two types of uninsured motorist coverage. Uninsured motorist bodily injury covers medical bills related to a crash, while uninsured motorist property damage pays for damage to your car.


   Uninsured Motorist vs. Underinsured Motorist Coverage  

In addition to uninsured drivers, there are also those who have some insurance but it may not be enough to cover the full cost of a claim if there's an accident. Again, most states require drivers to have minimum levels of at least liability coverage. But a driver who's hoping to save on their car insurance might opt for the lowest coverage amounts, which could lead to financial consequences for other drivers if they're involved in an accident.



It's important to be aware of this distinction since uninsured motorist coverage is not the same as underinsured motorist coverage, which would cover a situation in which the at-fault driver did not have enough insurance to fully cover the other injured party's damages. However, these two types of coverage may be bundled together. Either separately or together, they are usually a relatively inexpensive add-on to an auto insurance policy but provide beneficial coverage.





Note

Some states allow you to "stack" uninsured motorist and underinsured motorist coverage when you have multiple vehicles listed on the same policy.


   Requirements for Claiming Uninsured Motorist Coverage  

During the investigation of an accident, if the at-fault driver does not have insurance, the police will inform the other involved drivers. If the police do not respond to the accident or, in the case of a hit-and-run crash, try to gather as much information as possible. Ask for names, addresses, and phone numbers of potential witnesses. If possible, get the license plate number of the other car and take photographs of the accident scene. 



As soon as possible, file a claim with your insurance company, providing all the information you may have. Some insurance providers will have a limit on how long you can wait before you file your uninsured claim. These limits will vary by company.



As the insurance company settles your claim, it will want copies and billings from all medical care received and any automobile repair that resulted from the event. If the insurance provider decides the costs submitted with the claim are unnecessary or not related to the accident, they will deny those amounts. If the policyholder disagrees with the decision of the insurance provider, the case will usually go to binding arbitration.





Tip

Any time you're involved in a car accident, it's important to first check for injuries and move the vehicle off the roadway if necessary.
What Is Unintentional Tort?  

An unintentional tort is a type of unintended accident that leads to injury, property damage, or financial loss. In the event of an unintentional tort, the person who caused the accident did so inadvertently and typically because they were not being careful.



The person who caused the accident is considered negligent because they failed to exercise the same degree of care that a reasonable person would have in the same situation.





Key Takeaways

An unintentional tort is treated differently than an intentional tort by courts and insurance companies, since the accident was caused by negligence, rather than premeditation or ill intent.Just like other proceedings in courts, children are treated differently. The court will assess a broad picture of the child, their background, and the circumstances of the unintentional tort.A child can sue their parents for unintentional tort.Unintentional tort must satisfy three conditions to be considered as such: the defendant caused the injuries, the defendant failed to provide the standard of care of a reasonable person, and that the defendant owed the plaintiff an obligation to avoid careless action.


   Understanding Unintentional Tort  

The most common type of unintentional tort is negligence. Someone is negligent if they unintentionally cause injury to someone in a situation where a "reasonable" person would have been aware of their actions enough to not cause harm. To prove a defendant was negligent, a plaintiff must prove three factors. 


   The Unintentional Negligence Tort in Court  

To prove unintentional negligence in a court of law, a plaintiff must first prove that the defendant owed the plaintiff a "duty of care" or an obligation to avoid careless actions that could cause harm to one or more persons. Second, the plaintiff must prove that the defendant failed to provide the standard of care of a reasonable person. Standard of care is a gauge of how much care one person owes another, and it's higher for some people than others. Doctors, for example, owe a higher standard of care toward others than a regular person.



Last, the plaintiff must prove that the defendant's actions caused their injuries. Determining the cause, known as cause-in-fact, is often done by applying the “but for” test, as in an injury would not have happened “but for” the defendant’s actions.



Children can be held responsible for the damage they cause, but the courts place a different standard of care on a child. Courts will consider the child’s age, life experience, and what a child of a similar age would have done under similar circumstances. Children under age 6 are rarely found liable for their actions. 



Parents can be held liable if they fail to train their children or properly supervise their activities, but they are not automatically held liable for a child's actions. However, a child can sue a parent if they were injured because of a parent’s negligence.


   An Example of Unintentional Tort  

To illustrate this concept, consider a camp counselor that takes a group of campers on a river rafting trip but fails to provide life jackets. If a camper falls in and drowns, a court might contend that the camper would not have drowned “but for” the camp counselor’s failure to provide a life jacket. In this example, the camp counselor's negligence was the cause-in-fact of the injury.
What Is a Unique Three River?  

The unique three river is a candlestick chart pattern that predicts a bullish reversal, although there is some evidence that it could act as a bearish continuation pattern. The unique three river pattern is composed of three price candles. If the price moves higher after the pattern, then it is considered a bullish reversal. If the price moves lower after the pattern, then it is a bearish continuation pattern.





Key Takeaways

The unique three river pattern is composed of three candlesticks, in a specific sequence: a long downward real body, a hammer that makes a new low, and a third candle with a small upward real body that stays within the range of the hammer.Traditionally, the pattern indicates a bullish reversal but the price can actually move either direction after the pattern occurs.Traders often use the direction of a confirmation candle, which is the fourth candle, to signal which direction the price is likely to move following the pattern.


   What Does the Unique Three River Candlestick Pattern Tell You?  










Image by Julie Bang © Investopedia 2020



The unique three river is a candlestick chart pattern that meets the following criteria:



The market is in a bearish downtrend.
The first candle has a bearish long real body (close lower than open).
The second candle is a hammer with a lower shadow that sets a new low.
The third candle has a short white body (close above open) that's below the real body of the second candle.
The third candle does not exceed the high or low of the second candle.



The long real body of the first candle shows that bears control the prevailing trend while the hammer in the second candle suggests that bulls are regaining strength following a protracted decline. In the third candle, the open comes in higher than the prior period's low and the small white body shows signs of stability and the potential for a move higher.



These dynamics suggest a potential bullish reversal from the downtrend, although there is some evidence that it more often leads to a bearish continuation. As a result, it is important for traders to consider the candlestick pattern within the context of other forms of analysis, such as technical indicators or chart patterns over a longer timeframe.


   Unique Three River Trading Psychology  

The wide range decline on the first trading day drops the security to a new low, illustrating that bears control price action. Weakened bulls make a stand on the second trading day, reversing the security after it hits a new low (below the first candle). Their buying power lifts the security into a close in the upper half of the first candle's range. The security opens lower on the third trading day, signaling a reduction in bull power; however, bears fail to capitalize on that weakness, generating an indecisive session within the trading range of the second candle.  



This behavior may indicate that bear power is waning, setting the stage for a bullish price thrust on the fourth trading day.


   Trading the Unique Three River Pattern  

Trading candlestick patterns typically require confirmation. Confirmation is provided on the fourth candle, in this case, or the candle after the pattern completes. If the price moves higher on the confirmation candle, this helps confirm the bullish reversal and a trader could take a long position with a stop loss below the low of the second candle.



If the price proceeds lower on the fourth candle, this would negate the bullish bias and instead indicate the potential for the price to drop. A trader could take a short position with a stop loss above the high of the second candle.



The price may move one direction and then the other, stopping the trader out, but then triggering a trade in the other direction. Entering a second time may be worthwhile since a false breakout in the opposite direction could fuel a strong price move in the new direction.


   Example of How to Use the Unique Three River Candlestick Pattern for Trading  

Due to the specifics of the pattern, seeing one is relatively rare compared to more common candlestick patterns like engulfing patterns.



Once the psychology of the pattern is understood, some traders will trade variations of the pattern as long as the overall psychology remains intact. For example, the second candle may not be a hammer but rather a long-legged doji. The third candle may move slightly lower instead of higher (close relative to open). Even with these differences, the overall pattern psychology remains intact, especially if there is a strong confirmation candle (in either direction) following the formation.



The following variation on the unique three river pattern occurred in the gold market during an uptrend. The pattern itself was the downward correction within the uptrend. Following the pattern the price resumed moving higher.

The pattern does not provide a profit target. The trader must determine how and when they will take profit.


   Difference Between the Unique Three River and the Three Inside Up Candlestick Patterns  

Both of these candlestick patterns are composed of three candles, but there are some differences in how the patterns are formed. In the three inside up reversal pattern, the first candle is a downward candle with a long real body. The second candle is fully within the first candle, and it has a small upward real body. The third is an up candle that closes above the second candle.


   Limitations of the Unique Three River Candlestick Pattern  

The main limitation of the pattern is that sometimes the price moves higher after it, and sometimes the price moves lower. This means traders should wait for confirmation, which comes from the fourth candle, to signal which direction the price will go next.



The pattern also doesn't have a profit target, so some other method is required for taking profit.



The unique three river pattern is also quite rare. It doesn't occur very often, so many traders opt to trade slight variations of the patterns, although trading random variations may not produce good results over many trades since such random variations may not have been properly backtested for profitability.

What Is the Unit Benefit Formula?  

The unit benefit formula is a method of calculating an employer's contribution to an employee's defined benefit plan or pension plan based on years of service. Although a retirement plan that uses a unit benefit formula can reward employees for remaining at the company longer, it can also be more costly to implement for the employer.





Key Takeaways

The unit benefit formula is a method of calculating an employer's contribution to an employee's pension plan based on years of service.The unit benefit formula means the company pays a percentage of the employee's salary, which might range from 1.25% to 2.5%.An advantage of a retirement plan that uses a unit benefit formula is that employees are compensated for working longer at a company.


   How the Unit Benefit Formula Works  

A unit benefit plan is an employer-sponsored pension plan that provides retirement benefits based on a dollar amount or, more typically, a percentage of the employee's earnings for each year of service. The unit benefit formula means the company pays a percentage of the employee's salary for each year of service.



A unit benefit plan is usually based on a percentage ranging from 1.25 to 2.5%. When the employee retires, their years of service are multiplied by the percentage multiplied by the career average salary to determine the employee's annual retirement benefit.



An advantage of a retirement plan that uses a unit benefit formula is that employees are compensated for working longer at a company. However, the unit benefit method requires the services of an actuary and, in turn, higher associated costs for the employer.


   Defined Benefit Plan  

A defined benefit plan is an employer-sponsored retirement plan where employee benefits are computed using a formula that considers several factors, such as length of employment and salary history. The company administers portfolio management and investment risk for the plan. There are also restrictions on when and by what method an employee can withdraw funds without penalties.



Defined benefit plans, which include pension plans or qualified benefit plans, are termed defined because employees and employers know the formula for calculating retirement benefits ahead of time. This fund is different from other pension funds, where the payout amounts depend on investment returns.



If poor returns result in a funding shortfall, employers must tap into the company’s earnings to make up the difference. Because the employer is responsible for making investment decisions and managing the plan's investments, the employer assumes all the investment risk.



A tax-qualified benefit plan has the same characteristics as a pension plan, but it also gives the employer and beneficiaries additional tax incentives not available under non-qualified plans.


   Qualified Retirement Plan  

A qualified retirement plan meets the requirements of Internal Revenue Code Section 401a​​​​​​​, and so it's eligible to receive certain tax benefits. Such a retirement plan is established by an employer for the benefit of the company’s employees.



Qualified retirement plans give employers a tax break for the contributions they make for their employees. Qualified plans that allow employees to defer a portion of their salaries into the plan also reduce employees’ present income-tax liability by reducing taxable income. Qualified retirement plans can help employers attract and retain employees.


  Contribution Limits for Qualified Plans  

The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has established annual contribution limits for employees enrolled in qualified plans such as 401(k)s. For 2022, the maximum contribution limit for a 401(k) is $20,500.  If an employee is aged 50 or older, they can make an additional catch-up contribution of $6,500.



For 2023, the maximum contribution limit increases to account for inflation: it is $22,500, and the catch-up contribution for those aged 50 and older goes up to $7,500.



The IRS has also established annual limits for total contributions from both the employee and employer to a defined contribution retirement plan.  For 2022, the total annual contributions to an employee's account cannot exceed $61,000 or $67,500, including catch-up contributions. For 2023, the limits are $66,000 and $73,500 respectively.
What Is Unit Cost?  

A unit cost is a total expenditure incurred by a company to produce, store, and sell one unit of a particular product or service. Unit costs are synonymous with cost of goods sold (COGS).



This accounting measure includes all of the fixed and variable costs associated with the production of a good or service. Unit cost is a crucial cost measure in the operational analysis of a company. Identifying and analyzing a company's unit costs is a quick way to check if a company is producing a product efficiently.


   Variable and Fixed Unit Costs  

Successful companies seek ways to improve the overall unit cost of their products by managing the fixed and variable costs. Fixed costs are production expenses that are not dependent on the volume of units produced. Examples are rent, insurance, and equipment. Fixed costs, such as warehousing and the use of production equipment, may be managed through long-term rental agreements.



Variable costs vary depending on the level of output produced. These expenses have a further division into specific categories such as direct labor costs and direct material costs. Direct labor costs are the salaries paid to those who are directly involved in production while direct material costs are the cost of materials purchased and used in production. Sourcing materials can improve variable costs from the cheapest supplier or by outsourcing the production process to a more efficient manufacturer.





Key Takeaways

Generally, unit costs represent the total expense involved in creating one unit of a product or service.Goods-centric unit cost measures will vary between businesses.A large organization may lower the unit cost through economies of scale. The cost is useful in gross profit margin analysis and forms the base level for a market offering price.Companies seek to maximize profit by reducing unit costs and optimizing the market offering price. 


   Unit Cost on Financial Statements  

A company's financial statements will report the unit cost. These reports are vital for internal management analysis. The reporting of unit costs can vary by type of business. Companies that manufacture goods will have a more clearly defined calculation of unit costs while unit costs for service companies can be somewhat vague.



Both internal management and external investors analyze unit costs. These individual item expenses include all of the fixed and variable expenses directly associated with a product's production such as workforce wages, advertising fees, and the cost to run machinery or warehouse products. Managers closely monitor these costs to mitigate rising expenses and seek out improvements to reduce the unit cost. Typically, the larger a company grows, the lower the unit cost of production becomes. This reduction is because of economies of scale. Production at the lowest possible cost will maximize profits.


   Accounting for Unit Costs  

Private and public companies account for unit costs on their financial reporting statements. All public companies use the generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) accrual method of reporting.﻿﻿ These businesses have the responsibility of recording unit costs at the time of production and matching them to revenues through revenue recognition. As such, goods-centric companies will file unit costs as inventory on the balance sheet at product creation. When the event of a sale occurs, unit costs will then be matched with revenue and reported on the income statement.



The first section of a company's income statement focuses on direct costs. In this section, analysts may view revenue, unit costs, and gross profit. Gross profit shows the amount of money a company has made after subtracting unit costs from its revenue. Gross profit and a company's gross profit margin (gross profit divided by sales) are the leading metrics used in analyzing a company's unit cost efficiency. A higher gross profit margin indicates a company is earning more per dollar of revenue on each product sold.


   Breakeven Analysis  

The unit cost, also known as the breakeven point, is the minimum price at which a company must sell the product to avoid losses. As an example, a product with a breakeven unit cost of $10 per unit must sell for above that price. Revenue above this price is company profit.



The calculation of the unit cost of production is a breakeven point. This cost forms the base level price that a company uses when determining its market price value. Overall, a unit must be sold for more than its unit cost to generate a profit. For example, a company produces 1,000 units that cost $4 per unit and sells the product for $5 per unit. The gain is $5 minus $4, or $1 per unit in revenue. If a unit were priced at $3 per unit, there would be a loss because $3 minus $4 (cost) is a loss of $1 per unit.



Companies consider a variety of factors when determining the market offering price of a unit. Some companies may have a high amount of indirect costs which requires higher pricing to more broadly cover all of the company's expenses.


   Real World Example  

Unit cost is determined by combining the variable costs and fixed costs and dividing by the total number of units produced. For example, assume total fixed costs are $40,000, variable costs are $20,000, and you produced 30,000 units. The total production costs are the $40,000 fixed costs added to the $20,000 variable costs for a total of $60,000. Divide $60,000 by 30,000 units to get $2 per unit production cost (40,000 + 20,000 = $60,000 ÷ 30,000 = $2 per unit).
What Is a Unit Investment Trust (UIT)?  

A unit investment trust (UIT) is an investment company that offers a fixed portfolio, generally of stocks and bonds, as redeemable units to investors for a specific period of time. It is designed to provide capital appreciation and/or dividend income. Unit investment trusts, along with mutual funds and closed-end funds, are defined as investment companies.





Key Takeaways


A unit investment trust (UIT) is a U.S. financial company that buys or holds a group of securities, such as stocks or bonds, and makes them available to investors as redeemable units.
UITS are similar to both open-ended and closed-end mutual funds in that they all consist of collective investments in which many investors combine their funds to be managed by a portfolio manager.
Like open-ended mutual funds, UITs are bought and sold directly from the company that issues them, although sometimes they can be bought on the secondary market; like closed-end funds, UITs are issued via an initial public offering (IPO). 
Unlike mutual funds, UITs have a stated expiration date based on what investments are held in its portfolio; when the portfolio terminates, investors get their cut of the UIT's net assets.
Also unlike mutual funds, UITs aren't actively-traded, meaning securities aren't bought or sold unless there's a change in the underlying investment, such as a corporate merger or bankruptcy. 



   Understanding Unit Investment Trusts (UITs)  

Investment companies offer individuals the opportunity to invest in a diversified portfolio of securities with a low initial investment requirement. UITs are sold by investment advisors and an owner can redeem the units to the fund or trust, rather than placing a trade in the secondary market. A UIT is either a regulated investment corporation (RIC) or a grantor trust. A RIC is a corporation in which the investors are joint owners, and a grantor trust grants investors proportional ownership in the UIT's underlying securities.


   How Investments Are Sold  

Investors can redeem mutual fund shares or UIT units at net asset value (NAV) to the fund or trust either directly or with the help of an investment advisor. NAV is defined as the total value of the portfolio divided by the number of shares or units outstanding and the NAV is calculated each business day. On the other hand, closed-end funds are not redeemable and are sold in the secondary market at the current market price. The market price of a closed-end fund is based on investor demand and not as a calculation of net asset value.






UITs often have a set maturity date between 12 to 24 months; during this time period, securities usually can not be sold.


   Types of Unit Investment Trusts  

Though the underlying characteristics of a UIT are often the same across different types of trusts, there are different strategies for UITs. These different types will vary in the underlying assets that are purchased and held, as each of the following UITs will have a different investment strategy:



Strategy Portfolio: This type of UIT strives to beat a market benchmark and outperform general investments. This UIT leverages fundamental analysis to determine what investments may beat the market.
Income Portfolio: This type of UIT strives to generate dividend income. It often de-prioritizes capital appreciation in favor of generating income.
Diversification Portfolio: This type of UIT strives to diversification portfolio assets across a broad range of investments. It aims to minimize risks.
Sector-Specific Portfolio: This type of UIT strives to focus on a very specific or niche market. This UIT is often higher risk, though this may result in higher profit.
Tax-Focused Portfolio: This UIT strives to invest in tax-benefit or tax-deferred investments. This includes investing in state-exempt or federal-exempt fixed income securities.


   Unit Invest Trusts vs. Mutual Funds  
  End Dates  

Mutual funds are open-ended funds, meaning that the portfolio manager can buy and sell securities in the portfolio. Meanwhile, a UIT pays interest income on the bonds and holds the portfolio until a specific end date when the bonds are sold and the principal amount is returned to the owners. Investors may prefer UITs if they're looking for investments with clearly defined start and stop schedules. a UIT may also be rolled into other another UIT if it is part of a series.


  Number of Shares  

Many investors prefer to use mutual funds for stock investing so that the portfolio can be traded. If an investor is interested in buying and holding a portfolio of bonds and earning interest, that individual may purchase a UIT or closed-end fund with a fixed portfolio. The UIT will have a specified limit on the number of available shares that cannot be merged or split.


  Level of Activity  

The investment objective of each mutual fund is to outperform a particular benchmark, and the portfolio manager trades securities to meet that objective. A stock mutual fund, for example, may have an objective to outperform the Standard & Poor’s 500 index of large-cap stocks. Meanwhile, UITs are not actively managed. Assets are purchased upfront, then those assets are held for the duration of the UIT. In rare cases, trust sponsors may be allowed to exchange the trust assets.






There are stock and bond UITs, but bond UITs are typically more popular than their stock counterparts, as they offer predictable income and are less likely to suffer losses.


   Advantages and Disadvantages of UITs  
  Pros of UITs  

Unit Investment Trusts (UITs) have several specific investment advantages. UITs provide investors with access to a diversified portfolio of securities; this can help to reduce the risk of losses due to any single security's underperformance. Be mindful that some UITs are industry-specific (i.e. 100% invested in healthcare), and these UITs do hold greater risk. 



UITs are required to disclose their portfolios regularly, providing investors with greater transparency into their holdings and investment strategy. In addition, UITs are generally passive investments. This means they do not involve active management or frequent trading. This can result in lower fees and expenses compared to actively managed funds. UITs are also typically structured as pass-through entities, which means they do not pay taxes at the trust level. This can result in greater tax efficiency.



UITs often have low minimum investment requirements, making them accessible to a wider range of investors. In addition, more investors may appreciate the simplicity of a UIT. UITs have a fixed portfolio of securities and a set investment strategy. This means their performance is usually more predictable than actively managed funds that may change their holdings and investment strategy over time.


  Con of UITs  

UITs unfortunately have a number of downsides as well. Because UITs have a fixed portfolio of securities and a set investment strategy, investors have little control over the investments made by the trust. In some cases, poor performers are also retained and sponsors usually maintain UIT assets without trading away or changing strategy. 



As mentioned before, while UITs do provide some diversification, they typically invest in a specific market sector or asset class. This means they may not provide the same level of diversification as more broadly diversified investments.



UITs are designed to be long-term investments, so they may not be appropriate for investors who need access to their funds on short notice. UITs are also not traded on exchanges like mutual funds and may incur fees upfront, so investors may have difficulty buying or selling units or must be prepared to incur higher costs when purchasing the investment.



In some cases, UITs may not provide as much information about their investment strategy or performance as other types of investments. This includes not having as much transparency around fees, expenses, or future plans for changes in assets. 





Pros

May promote diversification depending on assets selected
May be transparent as there are specific reporting requirements
May incur less fees due to passive management
May be more predictable as there is often a set investment strategy
May be tax-efficient depending on the UIT strategy



Cons

May be less flexible as the UIT strategy is usually not changed
May be less diversified if invested in a single industry or asset class
May front-loan fees
May be intended for long-term holding periods with limited liquidity
May have limited information about fees, expenses, or future strategy





   UITs and Taxation  

UITs are generally structured as pass-through entities for tax purposes. This means UITs often don't pay taxes at the trust level. Instead, income, gains, and losses are passed through to the investors in the trust. As a result, investors are responsible for paying taxes on their share of the trust's income, gains, and losses and the trust is tax-exempt.



The tax treatment of a UIT can vary depending on the types of securities held by the trust and the investor's individual tax situation. For example, if the trust holds stocks or other securities that pay dividends, the dividends will be passed through to the investor and taxed as ordinary income. Similarly, if the trust sells securities for a profit, all capital gains are passed through to the investor.



One potential tax advantage of UITs is that they are generally structured as a passive investment. This means that because investments are bought and sold less frequently, they may have lower turnover and generate fewer capital gains than actively managed funds. This can result in greater tax efficiency for investors looking to minimize their capital gains taxes.


   UIT Costs  

Like other forms of investing, UITs carry with them a variety of costs. Some UITs charge a sales charge called a load. This sales charge is typically a percentage of the investment amount and can range from 1% to 5% or more.



UITs typically charge a management fee which is a percentage of the assets held in the trust. The management fee covers the costs of managing the portfolio and other administrative expenses, though these fees may be less than actively managed investments.



UITs also charge trustee fees. These trustee fees cover the costs of the trustee responsible for overseeing the trust. Trustee fees are typically a fixed amount or a percentage of the assets held in the trust, though there may be other expenses included specific for legal, accounting, custody, or administration fees.


   Real-World Example  

Guggenheim's Global 100 Dividend Strategy Portfolio Series 14 (CGONNX) was founded on March 15, 2018 with the intent to provide dividend income. It contained 100 diversified positions: 45.16% invested in large-cap stocks, 26.94% in mid-caps, and 27.90% in small caps. Roughly half of the securities are invested in U.S. stocks, with the balance invested in many other countries. Allocation reflects many sectors as well. Each company it holds represents roughly 1% of the portfolio.  



This UIT was created with a mandatory maturity date of June 17, 2019. Since the maturity date of this UIT, Guggenheim has continually offered new UIT offerings. For example, the Global 100 Dividend Strategy Portfolio Series 24 was created on Sept. 9, 2020 with a mandatory maturity date of Dec. 17, 2021.




How Does a Unit Investment Trust Work?
A UIT is a type of investment vehicle that pools money from multiple investors to purchase a fixed portfolio of securities, such as stocks or bonds. Once the trust is created, investors purchase units that represent a proportional ownership interest in the underlying assets. The trust is then managed and income is distributed over the life of the assets.




What Is the Primary Benefit of a Unit Investment Trust?
Many may argue that the main benefit of a UIT is the simplicity. Because it is a passive investment with a defined strategy, the assets of a UIT are usually not sold prior to maturity once they are purchased. Therefore, investors usually like the straight-forward nature of knowing exactly what securities will be held, what timeline is being managed, and what risks are being recognized.




What Is the Main Risk of a Unit Investment Trust?
The benefit above may also translate to one of the greatest downsides of a UIT. Because the assets are not frequently bought or sold, investments often lock into an investment plan that is not changed. The assets may not be re-evaluated as they are being held, and investors may lose money.


   The Bottom Line  

A UIT is very similar to a mutual fund. However, this investment vehicle often employs a passive investment strategy. Once securities are purchased, a UIT holds the assets for a predetermined amount of time. This gives investors peace of mind knowing the risk and diversification of the portfolio in addition to knowing the tax strategy of the underlying assets.
What Is a Unit Linked Insurance Plan (ULIP)?  

A unit linked insurance plan (ULIP) is a multi-faceted product that offers both insurance coverage and investment exposure in equities or bonds. This product requires policyholders to make regular premium payments. Part of the premiums goes toward insurance coverage, while the remaining portion is pooled with assets from other policyholders and invested in either equities, bonds, or a combination of both.





Key Takeaways

A unit linked insurance plan is a product that offers a combination of insurance and investment payout.ULIP policyholders must make regular premium payments, which cover both the insurance coverage and the investment.ULIPs are frequently used to provide a range of payouts to their beneficiaries following their death.ULIPs often have a lock-in period in which the plan cannot be broken; if the plan is surrendered, there is often penalty fees and tax implications.The underlying risk of ULIPs is in the securities selected, and ULIPs can lose investment capital.


   Understanding Unit Linked Insurance Plans (ULIPs)  

A unit linked insurance plan can be used for various purposes, including providing life insurance, building wealth, generating retirement income, and paying for the educations of children and grandchildren. In many cases, an investor opens a ULIP to provide benefits to their descendants. With a life insurance ULIP, the beneficiaries would receive payments following the owner’s death.



A unit linked insurance plan’s investment options are structured much like mutual funds, in that they pool investments with those from other investors. As such, a ULIP's assets are managed with an eye toward accomplishing a specified investment objective. Investors can buy shares in a single strategy or diversify their investments across multiple market-linked ULIP funds.


   Investing in a Unit Linked Insurance Plan  

Policyholders must commit an initial lump-sum payment when they first buy into a ULIP, followed by annual, semi-annual, or monthly premium payments. Although the premium payment obligations vary from product to product, in all cases, they are proportionally directed towards a designated investment mandate.



The regular premium payments enable policyholders to systematically build up principal more quickly than could be accomplished by waiting for returns to accumulate. In addition, many ULIPs offer the option of "topping up", or adding significant lump sums to the balance.





Important

Even though ULIPs are partly an insurance product, a focus on exposure to equities in the investment side of the product can raise investor risk.



ULIPs are unique in that they offer flexibility to investors, who may adjust their fund preferences throughout the duration of their investment. For example, they can shuttle between stock funds, bond funds, and diversified funds depending on their investment needs.


   Advantages and Disadvantages of ULIPs  
  Pros of Unit Linked Insurance Plans  

The obvious benefit of ULIPs is the dual coverage; ULIPs provide both investment and insurance benefits. The life insurance portion of the premium is paid in part, and the remaining amount is invested in equity, debt, or a combination of the two. ULIPs provide flexibility in the form of premium payment alternatives, investment possibilities, and fund switching as investors can select the investment option that best fits their investing objectives and risk tolerance.



Because ULIPs are created with long-term investment objectives in mind, they aid in building wealth over the long term. ULIPs have the potential to provide larger returns than conventional insurance plans because they invest in equities and debt securities. In addition, investors can set a policy and have auto-withdrawals automatically deposited into the plan to ensure long-term contributions.



Following a predetermined lock-in period, ULIPs offer the option of partial withdrawal. This enables investors to take care of their urgent demands without giving up their policy entirely. In addition, depending on the state of the market and your investing objectives, ULIPs give you the choice of moving between funds. As a result, investors can transfer funds without terminating their insurance policies.


  Cons of Unit Linked Insurance Plans  

Despite its flexibility, there are some downsides to ULIPs. Charges for premium allocation, policy administration, and fund management are among the high fees associated with ULIPs. The returns on the investment may be greatly impacted by these ongoing, recurring charges. ULIPs make investments in debt and equity securities, both of which are exposed to market risks. There is no assurance of returns, and the investment's value may change based on market conditions. Like any other investment, there is the potential to lose capital contributed to the plan.



Sometimes, you can't touch the ULIP balance for a period of time. For instance, a 5-year lock-in term for ULIPs prohibits investors from taking their money out before the period has ended. If investors require the money before the lock-in period is through, they may not have the flexibility they need. Alternatively, investors who choose to terminate their ULIP before the lock-in period is up can be required to pay exit fees.



Last, for investors who demand a higher degree of insurance coverage, the insurance component of ULIPs might not be adequate. Investors might need to get more insurance coverage in such circumstances, thereby not having their entire need by a single ULIP alone.





Pros

Offers the benefit of both insurance and investments
May offer flexibility in the investments that can be chosen
Are intended for long-term wealth creation
May allow for partial withdrawals



Cons

Often come with higher fees and administration charges
Experience the same market exposure as any other investment
May face a lock-in period where funds can't be touched
May not meet all insurance needs





   ULIPs vs. Fixed Deposits  

Investors often must choose between contributing capital between a ULIP or a fixed deposit (FD) plan. While ULIPs are a type of investment option that combines insurance with investing, FDs are only investment vehicles.



The main difference between the two relate to the wealth creation. The returns on ULIP investments in stock and debt instruments are not fixed and are subject to fluctuations. Market circumstances and fund performance both affect returns. FDs, in contrast, provide fixed returns that are independent of the state of the market.



Because ULIPs invest in stock and debt instruments, which are prone to market fluctuations, they entail a certain amount of risk. You can lose deposited capital with a ULIP. FDs, on the other hand, offer fixed returns, making them lower-risk investments (at the sacrifice of higher returns).



After the lock-in period, partial withdrawals are possible with ULIPs, though there may be fees associated with the withdrawal amount. On the other hand, FDs more often not permit partial withdrawals, and an early withdrawal may incur penalties.




Is a ULIP Better Than a Mutual Fund?
For individuals looking for higher liquidity and potentially higher returns, a mutual fund may be a better choice. On the other hand, those looking for better security with a set long-term goal may receive the dual benefit of insurance and an investment should they fit with their portfolio profile.




Are ULIPs High Risk?
Broadly speaking, ULIPs do have an investment component that subjects them to the risk of loss of investment capital. ULIPs often allow an investor to select from a variety of equity and debt instruments, so the underlying risk of the plan does hinge on the investments selected and subsequent market performance.




Can I Break a ULIP Before Maturity?
You may be able to break a ULIP before it matures, often before the designated 5-year lock-in period. Be mindful that they may (and likely will be) penalty charges and tax implications on the surrender value received when the ULIP is broken.




What Happens to a ULIP After Maturity?
Once a ULIP has matured, the policy is paid out to the policyholder. The total amount paid out is the sum of the amount insured plus the amount invested. Note that should the policyholder have passed away, a nominee may be elected to receive the distribution.


   The Bottom Line  

A ULIP combines investing options with life insurance coverage. Premiums are paid by policyholders, with a portion going toward life insurance coverage and the remainder being placed in other investment funds like stocks, bonds, or mutual funds. ULIPs allow people to participate in the financial markets and have the potential for investment growth while also providing life insurance cover.
What Is the Unit of Production Method?  

The unit of production method is a method of calculating the depreciation of the value of an asset over time. It becomes useful when an asset's value is more closely related to the number of units it produces rather than the number of years it is in use. This method often results in greater deductions being taken for depreciation in years when the asset is heavily used, which can then offset periods when the equipment experiences less use.



This method can be contrasted with time-based measures of depreciation such as straight-line or accelerated methods.





Key Takeaways

The unit of production method for calculating depreciation considers an asset's practical usage in the production process rather than considering its time in use.This method is particularly utilized for assets that experience a high degree of wear and tear based on actual use per-unit such as certain pieces of machinery or production equipment.This method can allow companies to show higher depreciation expense in more productive years, which can offset other increased production costs.


   The Formula for the Unit of Production Method Is  

Depreciation expense for a given year is calculated by dividing the original cost of the equipment less its salvage value, by the expected number of units the asset should produce given its useful life. Then, multiply that quotient by the number of units (U) used during the current year.

​DE=[Estimated Production Capability(Original Value − Salvage Value)​]×Uwhere:DE=Depreciation Expense​﻿


   What Does the Unit of Production Method Tell You?  

Essentially, the units of production depreciation expense claimed in a year is based upon what percentage of an asset's production capacity was used up during that year. This depreciation method can help companies take larger depreciation deductions in years when a given piece of equipment is more productive. Companies claim depreciation on a piece of equipment or property for bookkeeping purposes, but also for tax deductions. Larger deductions in more productive years can help offset other, higher costs associated with higher production levels.



The unit of production method most accurately measures depreciation for assets where the "wear and tear" is based on how much they have produced, such as manufacturing or processing equipment. Using the unit of production method for this type of equipment can help a business keep track of its profits and losses more accurately than a chronology-based method such as straight-line depreciation or MACRS methods.



The unit of production method depreciation begins when an asset begins to produce units. It ends when the cost of the unit is fully recovered or the unit has produced all units within its estimated production capacity, whichever comes first. 


   Unit of Production vs. MACRS Methods   

The modified accelerated cost recovery system (MACRS) is a standard way to depreciate assets for tax purposes. Instead of being dependent on the number of units an asset might produce, this depreciation method involves calculations that result in the asset's value being depreciated with a declining balance for a set period of time, then switching to a straight-line depreciation method to finish the depreciation schedule.﻿﻿



For tax purposes, the IRS requires businesses to depreciate property using the Modified Accelerated Cost Recovery System (MACRS), but it allows businesses to exclude property from this method if it can be accurately depreciated by another method such as the unit of production method. To use this method, the owner must elect exclusion from MACRS by the return due date for the tax year the property is initially placed into service.﻿﻿

What Are Unit Sales?  

On a balance sheet, unit sales represent the total sales of a product in a given period. This sales information is used to determine the price point to achieve profit per unit given the actual cost of production.





Key Takeaways

Unit sales help determine the best price point for a product given the cost to manufacture.Unit sales are examined over different accounting periods, such as monthly, quarterly, or yearly.A company can forecast future unit sales by multiplying the anticipated number of units to be sold by the unit selling price.


   Understanding Unit Sales  

Unit sales appear on a company's income statement and are examined over different accounting periods, such as monthly, quarterly, or yearly. Companies use this figure to help determine the right price point for a product.



Unit sales help determine whether a product is facing margin pressure. If XYZ Corp. has $250 million in revenue and has sold 5 million units, the average selling price (ASP) is $50 per unit ($250 million/5 million). If the next reporting period shows an average selling price of $48, this may be a red flag for the company.



Comparing unit sales every year may help industry analysts determine if a company is moving in a positive direction. In 2021, Tesla posted sales of 936,000 electric vehicles, up 87% from 2020. The company reported it sold 308,600 units in the final quarter of 2021 alone.



Supply chain breakdowns since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 were debilitating for automakers, however, Tesla founder and CEO Elon Musk has stated that he was able to get around the semiconductor shortage by using new chip designs and rewriting software. 


   Unit Sales and Production  

The break-even point is the level of production at which the cost of production of one unit equals the revenue for that unit and there is no loss or gain.



Given the production costs per unit, the price of a unit is often adjusted to ensure at least a break-even point is achieved. Revenue generated per unit beyond the break-even point (BEP) is called profit.



Beyond the break-even point, companies analyze marginal cost, which is the change in the total cost when the quantity produced is incremented, or the cost of producing an additional quantity.



In the production of units, companies often factor in economies of scale, the cost advantages gleaned by companies when production becomes efficient. Economies of scale are reached by increasing production and lowering costs as costs are spread over a larger number of goods. Costs can be both fixed, like insurance and licenses, or variable, such as packaging supplies.


   Unit Sales Forecasting  

A company can and often forecasts future and projected sales by multiplying the anticipated number of units to be sold by the unit selling price.



Past financial results like profit and revenue will show patterns and a company can make reliable assumptions about future sales. Also, having already produced units for sale, a company will know its direct expenses to produce the units, also called the cost of goods sold (COGS).



Major corporations often predict future sales of their products using this data. With estimated first-quarter U.S. sales of 110,000 vehicles, Tesla is now leading the luxury segment and demand is easily outstripping its supply. Tesla's recent factory expansion, global annual production is expected to rise from about 1 million vehicles in 2021 to about 2 million in 2023, according to analysts.



While Tesla is transparent about future unit sales, Apple ceased reporting unit sales numbers in its earnings reports as of 2018. Apple executives decided that the number of units sold in any period is not necessarily representative of the underlying strength of its business. Apple saw that rather than providing clear insight into Apple's business, unit sales were a distraction from more important data and the nature of Apple's business.




What Is Sales Revenue?
Sales revenue equals the total units sold multiplied by the average price per unit.




What Is the Difference Between Unit Sales and Sales Volume?
Sales volume is defined as the number of units sold during a specific accounting period, such as per month, or per year.




What Are LIFO and FIFO?
LIFO, Last In First Out, and FIFO, First In First Out, are two distinct accounting methods to record the inventory of units produced and sold. FIFO is an accounting method in which units that were purchased or produced first are sold first. LIFO records the most recently produced units as sold first. 


   The Bottom Line  

The unit sales data on a balance sheet indicates the actual numbers of a product sold in a given reporting period. A company can forecast future and projected sales by multiplying the anticipated number of units to be sold by the unit selling price. Comparing unit sales over periods helps industry analysts determine if a company is moving in a positive direction.
What Is a Unit Trust (UT)?  

A unit trust is an unincorporated mutual fund structure that holds assets and provides profits to individual unit owners instead of reinvesting into the fund. A unit trust is established under a trust deed, and the investor is the beneficiary.





Key Takeaways

Unit trusts are unincorporated mutual funds that pass profits directly to investors rather than reinvest in the fund.In the United Kingdom, a unit trust is regarded as similar to a mutual fund in the United States.A fund manager directs the investments of a unit trust, and the investor is the beneficiary of the unit trust.


   Understanding Unit Trusts (UTs)  

A unit trust is a collective investment packaged under a trust deed. The fund manager may invest in bonds or shares on the stock market, and the fund is split into units, which investors purchase. Unit trusts provide access to securities, mortgages, and cash equivalents.



Unit trust structures vary by region but are offered in Guernsey, Jersey, Fiji, Ireland, New Zealand, Australia, Canada, Namibia, Kenya, Singapore, South Africa, the U.K., the Isle of Man, and Malaysia. In Asia, a unit trust is the same as a mutual fund. In Canada, these investments are called income trusts.


   Managing a Unit Trust  

Fund managers direct the portfolio of unit trusts. Trustees are assigned to ensure that the fund manager runs the trust following the fund’s investment goals and objectives and are often fiduciaries protecting the best interest of the beneficiaries. Owners of unit trusts are called unit-holders, and they hold the rights to the trust’s assets. Registrars act as middlemen or liaisons for both parties.


   How Unit Trusts Make Money  

The underlying value of the assets in a unit trust portfolio is directly stated by the number of units issued multiplied by the price per unit minus transaction fees, management fees, and associated costs.






In a unit trust, the price of each unit is based on the fund's net asset value (NAV) divided by the number of units outstanding.



Unit trusts allow for new contributions and withdrawals to and from the pool. When money is added to the trust, more units are made to match the current unit buying price. When units are withdrawn, assets are sold to match the current unit selling price.



Fund managers make money through the difference between buying price, or offer price, and the selling price, or bid price. The difference between the offer price and the bid price is called the bid-offer spread and depends on the assets managed.


   Advantages and Disadvantages of a Unit Trust  

As in all investments, there are risks and benefits associated with a unit trust.





Pros

Managed by a financial professional
One unit includes investments in a diversified portfolio
No obligation or fixed investment term required



Cons

Performance of the trust depends on the fund manager
Management Fees
Principal investment is not guaranteed







How Do Unit Trusts Differ From Mutual Funds?
Mutual funds are investments made from pooled money from investors and can include bonds and equities. However, a unit trust differs from a mutual fund in that a unit trust is established under a trust deed, and the investor is effectively the beneficiary.




What Is the Risk of Investing in a Unit Trust?
A unit trust carries risk just like other investments. The unit value or income may decrease, and an investor's principal is not guaranteed.




How Do Investors Withdraw Money From a Unit Trust?
Investors can exit the fund by selling units at the bid price. To earn a profit, the bid price must be higher than the offer price initially paid for the unit. 


   The Bottom Line  

A unit trust is an unincorporated mutual fund that holds assets and provides profits to individual unit owners instead of reinvesting into the fund. A unit trust is established under a trust deed, with the investor as the beneficiary. Unit trusts often include diversified portfolios and are managed by a financial professional.
What Is a Unitary Thrift?  

A unitary thrift is a chartered holding company that controls a single thrift entity. Historically, unitary thrifts could engage in a broader range of activities than bank holding companies, however, they have come under increasing restrictions since the 2008 financial crisis.





Key Takeaways

Unitary thrifts is another name for savings and loan holding companies.These types of companies focus on a range of thrift investments or products.Unitary thrifts are focused on their customers and communities, providing personal banking products like savings accounts, credit cards, home, and automobile loans.The range of products offered by unitary thrift companies is usually narrower than larger banking institutions.The entire savings and loan industry faced a financial crisis in the 1980s due to risky financial activities to protect them from losses from the interest rates for money market accounts in the late 1970s.


   Understanding a Unitary Thrift  

Unitary thrifts, also known as savings and loan holding companies, or SLHCs, are a type of holding company that mainly holds assets in thrift investments. Thrift institutions, also known as savings and loan associations, offer a narrower range of products than other financial institutions.



Unitary thrifts focus on customer and community service, which typically means they deal with traditional basic banking products, such as savings and checking accounts, home loans, personal loans, automobile loans, and credit cards.



These thrifts are more limited in these areas, such as providing loans for single-family homes as opposed to larger real estate ventures. Similarly, they focus on individuals and have only limited dealings with businesses. Thrifts are required by law to maintain 65% of their portfolio in assets related to housing or other qualified assets while they are only allowed to have 10% of assets in commercial loans.



Thrifts have traditionally catered towards the middle- and working-class and offer higher interest rates on savings than larger, national banks. The reason they can offer better rates is because that they can borrow at lower rates from the Federal Home Loan Banking System.


   Savings and Loan Ownership Structures  

Unitary thrifts represent one of the two ownership models for savings and loan companies. Unitary thrifts offer a small group of investors a way of controlling a savings and loan through the purchase of stock in the holding company that owns the thrift.



Due to the liberalization of lender tests, a variety of financial institutions are able to own depository institutions. These include insurance companies and commercial companies. These entities can buy thrifts, becoming a holding company, and the owners of these companies gain exposure to the thrift.



The other ownership model is a mutual ownership structure, where depositors and borrowers receive part ownership of the savings and loans when they engage in business with the company.


   Regulatory History of Unitary Thrifts  

Because thrifts tended to serve customer needs rather than investor desires, they initially operated under less regulatory oversight, and prior regulatory regimes allowed unitary thrifts to open branches anywhere in the United States.


  Savings and Loan Crisis  

In the 1980s, the savings and loan industry underwent a crisis after thrifts engaged in risky financial activities in an attempt to cover losses caused by depositors who moved their cash from thrifts to money market funds as interest rates boomed in the late 1970s.



By 1989, much of the industry had collapsed after failed thrifts caused the insolvency of the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation (FSLIC), which insured deposits.






Due to regulatory changes and mergers, thrift banks are not as prominent as they once were.



The Financial Services Modernization Act of 1999, also known as the Gramm Leach Bliley Act, forbade the Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS) from accepting any new applications for unitary thrifts. Since that time, the federal government has increased restrictions on the remaining unitary thrifts.


  2008 Financial Crisis  

After the 2008 financial crisis, sweeping regulation was made across the financial industry. The passage of the landmark Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act in 2010 eliminated the OTS in 2011, which suffered from implications of wrongdoing in the collapse of IndyMac and the failure of AIG during the 2008 financial crisis.



Dodd-Frank passed supervision of legacy unitary thrifts to other federal agencies and the goal was that savings and loan holding companies (SLHCs) would be treated almost like bank holding companies (BHCs) with only a few distinctions. This would allow for more oversight over thrifts.



Much of the legislation impacted controlling and non-controlling ownership of thrift holding companies, the composition of capital, an introduction of new capital ratios, as well as new liquidity ratios. There are also other criteria, such as being "well-managed" and "well-capitalized."




What Is a Unit Bank?
A unit bank is a small, local bank that provides banking services to a small community in the region it is located. Unit banks stand in contrast to large, national banks that provide a vast array of services to millions of customers through different branches. A unit bank does not have any other locations or branches and is a standalone entity.




What Is the Difference Between a Unit Bank and a Branch Bank?
A unit bank is one, single bank that provides simple banking services to its clients, such as checking and savings accounts and small loans. A branch bank, on the other hand, is part of a larger bank that operates in multiple locations across the country or specific region through its many bank branches. Unit banks are not connected to any other financial entity in the way bank branches are connected to one another.




What Services Do Thrift Banks Provide?
Thrift banks provide simple banking services, such as checking and savings accounts, mortgage loans, personal loans, and credit cards.
What Is the United Nations (UN)?  

The United Nations, commonly referred to as the U.N., is an international nonprofit organization formed in 1945 to increase political and economic cooperation among its member countries. 





Key Takeaways

The United Nations is an international governing body formed in 1945 to increase political and economic cooperation among its member countries.The U.N. grew out of the League of Nations following World War II; now, nearly every country in the world is a member.It has five principal component parts, including the U.N. Economic and Social Council, which coordinates the work of 15 specialized agencies.


   Purpose of the United Nations  

The United Nations was formed in 1945 in the wake of World War II as a way to reduce international tensions, promote human rights, and decrease the possibility of other large-scale conflicts. It is a successor to the League of Nations, a body devoted to international cooperation that was formed in 1920 after World War I but found itself unable to prevent the outbreak of war in Europe and Asia in the 1930s. The U.S. never joined the League of Nations.



Today, almost every country in the world is represented in the U.N., including the United States (U.N. headquarters is located in New York City). A few states lack U.N. membership, though some of these exercise de facto sovereignty. In some cases, this is because most of the international community does not recognize them as independent (e.g., Tibet, Somaliland, Abkhazia). In other cases, it is because one or more powerful member states have blocked their admittance (e.g., Taiwan, Kosovo).






There are five permanent U.N. members: the U.S., Russia, France, the U.K., and China. When a new state applies to join the U.N., it only takes one permanent member to veto the application.


   Structure of the UN  

The U.N. is made up of five principal bodies: the U.N. General Assembly, the U.N. Secretariat, the International Court of Justice, the U.N. Security Council, and the U.N. Economic and Social Council. A sixth, the U.N. Trusteeship Council, has been inactive since 1994.


  UN General Assembly   

This is the U.N.'s main deliberative body, in which all members have equal representation. It is headquartered in New York City, and its responsibilities include setting the U.N.'s budget, appointing rotating members to the Security Council, and passing non-binding resolutions that express the opinions of the international community.


  UN Secretariat   

The U.N. Secretariat is the executive wing of the U.N., charged with implementing policies set by its deliberative bodies. Its head, the Secretary-General, is the U.N.'s top official. The Secretariat, which is based in New York City, includes the Department of Peacekeeping Operations, which dispatches U.N. soldiers—known as "blue helmets"—on missions authorized by the Security Council.


  International Court of Justice   

The International Court of Justice is based in The Hague and has two main functions: to settle disputes submitted by member states according to international law and to issue advisory opinions on legal questions submitted by U.N. agencies. There are 15 judges, and the court's official languages are French and English. Appeals are not allowed, making the judgments final.


  UN Security Council   

The U.N. Security Council is charged with maintaining international security. It authorizes peacekeeping missions, accepts new U.N. members, and approves changes to the U.N. charter. The Security Council's structure allows a few powerful member states to dominate the U.N.: Russia, the U.K., France, China, and the U.S. hold permanent seats on the council and enjoy veto power. The Security Council's other 10 seats rotate on a staggered two-year schedule; as of 2021, they are occupied by Estonia, India, Ireland, Kenya, Mexico, Niger, Norway, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Tunisia, and Vietnam.


  UN Economic and Social Council   

The U.N. Economic and Social Council coordinates the activities of the U.N.'s 15 specialized agencies. These include the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), which leads efforts to improve food security; the International Labour Organization (ILO), which promotes workers' interests; and the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF), two of the Bretton Woods institutions, which were founded to shore up international financial stability.




Which Countries Are Not Members of the United Nations?
There are 193 members of the U.N., all of them sovereign nations. A special category allows so-called observer states to participate in General Assembly meetings, but they cannot vote. The two observer states are the Holy See and Palestine. The Holy See, with the pope at its head, was granted the status of a permanent observer in 1964. Palestine officially applied to join the U.N. in 2011, but the U.N. Security Council has not voted on the application. In 2012, the State of Palestine was officially recognized as a non-member state. Certain other states, including Kosovo and the Republic of China, or Taiwan, are not members because they're not recognized by all members of the U.N.




Who Founded the United Nations?
In April 1945, as World War II was coming to a close, representatives of 50 war-weary countries gathered in San Francisco, Calif., for the United Nations Conference on International Organization. For two months, the group worked on drafting and then signing the U.N. Charter, creating the United Nations, an international organization that all hoped would help prevent another world war. The charter was ratified by China, France, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, the U.S., and other nations, and the U.N. got off the ground officially on Oct. 24, 1945.




Who Is the Secretary-General of the UN?
The ninth secretary-general of the U.N., António Guterres, took office on Jan. 1, 2017. The Portugal native was recently sworn in to a second five-year term, which begins in January 2022.




What Are the Agencies Inside the United Nations?
The U.N. has a number of specialized agencies that are actually autonomous organizations working inside the United Nations. Some pre-date World War I, while others were associated with the League of Nations or arose when the U.N. was created or even later. Some of the best known of these agencies, which are headquartered all over the world, include the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), which fights hunger; the World Health Organization (WHO), which is the authority on international health at the U.N.; the International Monetary Fund (IMF), which helps foster economic growth; the International Labor Organization (ILO), which sets international labor standards; the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), which helps protect important cultural and historic sites across the globe; and the World Bank, which aims to reduce poverty and raise living standards around the world.
What Is the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL)?  

The term United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL) refers to a subsidiary body of the United Nations General Assembly. Established in 1966, UNCITRAL is the core legal body of the U.N,'s system in the field of international trade law. The official function of UNCITRAL is to modernize and harmonize the rules of international business. The organization is responsible for helping to facilitate international trade and investment. It is headquartered in New York with annual sessions held alternatively in Vienna.





Key Takeaways

The United Nations Commission on International Trade Law is a subsidiary body of the United Nations General Assembly.UNCITRAL was established in 1966 and is headquartered in New York.The organization is responsible for helping to facilitate international trade and investment.The organization operates on the premise that international trade benefits all global participants.UNCITRAL's mandate includes dispute resolution, electronic commerce, and the sale of goods.


   Understanding the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL)  

The United Nations established the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL) in 1966. The move was in response to the rapid rise of global trade that took place in the 1960s. At the time, national governments recognized the need for harmonized global standards to replace the various national and regional regulations which, until then, largely governed international trade.



UNCITRAL is headquartered in New York, which is the same location as the U.N.'s headquarters. Annual sessions take place once each year usually in the summer and are held alternatively in New York and at the Vienna International Centre in Vienna.



The organization operates on the premise that international trade has global benefits for its participants. With increasing economic interdependence globally, UNCITRAL seeks to help expand and facilitate global trade through the progressive harmonization and modernization of the law of international trade.



Through the salient areas of commercial law. its mandate covers include:



Dispute resolutionInternational contract practicesTransportInsolvencyElectronic commerceInternational paymentsSecured transactionsProcurementThe sale of goods



The organization is also responsible for coordinating the work of other bodies active in international trade, both within and outside of the UN, to enhance cooperation, consistency, and efficiency while avoiding duplication.



UNCITRAL aims to formulate modern, fair, and harmonized rules for such commercial transactions. Its work includes conventions, model laws, and rules which are acceptable worldwide; legal and legislative guides, and practical recommendations; updated information on case law and enactments of uniform commercial law; technical assistance in law reform projects; and regional and national seminars on uniform commercial law.






According to UNCITRAL, much of the complex network of international legal rules and agreements that affect today's commercial arrangements were reached through long and detailed consultations and negotiations organized by the organization.


   Special Considerations  

The UN General Assembly elects members for terms of six years. These aren't unison, though, as the terms of half of the members expire every three years. In this way, no country or bloc should be able to dominate the organization.



Membership of UNCITRAL is determined by the U.N. General Assembly. The original membership comprised 29 member states of the U.N. But this number was expanded to 36 in 1973. Its membership grew again in 2002 to 60 states, and again in 2022 with a total of 70 member states. States represent a variety of legal traditions and levels of economic development.



Member states are deliberately chosen to be globally representative. The organization aims to include 14 African states, 14 Asian states, eight Eastern European states, 10 Latin American and Caribbean states, 14 Western European states, and others. As of June 2022, though, there were a total of 65 member states. The table below highlights each member state along with their respective three-year expiry dates.

What Is the United Nations Global Compact?  

The United Nations Global Compact is a strategic initiative that supports global companies that are committed to responsible business practices in the areas of human rights, labor, the environment, and corruption. This UN-led initiative promotes activities that contribute to sustainable development goals to create a better world.





Key Takeaways

The United Nations Global Compact is an initiative that global corporations can sign on to committing to responsible business practices in the areas of human rights, labor, the environment, and corruption.The UN Global Compact has 10 operating principles outlining these values.For example, a corporation that is part of the UN Global Compact could commit to providing free Wi-Fi access in remote areas of the world.


   Understanding the United Nations Global Compact  

The UN Global Compact is based on 10 principles that should define a company’s value system and approach to doing business. These principles were collectively founded in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Labor Organization’s Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work, the Rio Declaration on Environment and Development, and the UN Convention Against Corruption. Member companies are expected to engage in specific business practices that benefit the people and the planet while pursuing profitability with integrity.


   The United Nations Global Compact’s 10 Principles for Businesses  

The 10 principles for businesses, as stated on the UN Global Compact’s website, are the following:



Principle 1: Support and respect the protection of internationally proclaimed human rights.
Principle 2: Ensure that business practices are not complicit in human rights abuses.
Principle 3: Uphold the freedom of association and the effective recognition of the right to collective bargaining.
Principle 4: Eliminate all forms of forced and compulsory labor.
Principle 5: Abolish child labor.
Principle 6: Eliminate discrimination in employment and occupation.
Principle 7: Adopt a precautionary approach to environmental challenges.
Principle 8: Conduct environmentally responsible activities.
Principle 9: Encourage the development and diffusion of environmentally friendly technologies.
Principle 10: Fight corruption in all its forms including extortion and bribery.



Companies that join the compact are expected to integrate these principles into their corporate strategies, culture, and day-to-day operations. Companies are also expected to advocate the principles publicly and communicate with stakeholders on progress toward meeting the principles. Any company that commits to upholding the principles may join the compact, which is not legally binding and is purely voluntary. 


   Member Company Responsibilities of the UN Global Compact   

Member companies of the UN Global Compact are expected to act in environmentally responsible ways with regard to climate change, water and sanitation, energy, biodiversity, and food and agriculture. They are also expected to recognize the link between environmental issues, and social and development priorities. 



Member companies must also be focused on social sustainability, particularly human rights as they apply to labor, women’s empowerment and gender equality, children, indigenous peoples, people with disabilities, and people living in poverty. The compact believes that protecting human rights is primarily a government responsibility but businesses should contribute or, at a minimum, avoid harm.



Ways in which businesses can contribute to human rights include creating jobs, developing goods and services that help people meet their basic needs, promoting public policies that support social sustainability, partnering with other businesses to have a greater impact, and making strategic social investments.


   Incentives for Businesses to Support the UN Global Compact  

Companies might choose to join the compact because of the importance of corporate codes of conduct for developing and maintaining positive relationships with customers, employees, and other stakeholders, and to avoid regulatory and legal problems. Businesses may support the compact for the greater good but also because operating in environments associated with poverty and inequality where the rule of law is weak can harm the company’s reputation and bottom line.



Further, companies that commit to sustainability may have an advantage in accessing untapped markets, attracting and retaining business partners, developing innovative new products and services while operating in a lower-risk environment, and encouraging employee satisfaction and productivity.



An example of sustainable activity by a member company is to support inclusive, equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all. A company might partner with governments and other companies to create open-source technology. This technology can deliver education to hard-to-reach communities and develop low-cost learning materials for under-resourced schools.
What is the United States Agency for International Development (USAID)?  

The term United States Agency for International Development (USAID) refers to an international development agency run by the United States government. The organization provides international development and humanitarian assistance in a number of areas to developing nations while promoting American interests, U.S. national security, and economic prosperity abroad. USAID was established in 1961 and works in more than 100 countries.





Key Takeaways

The United States Agency for International Development is a U.S.-government-run international development agency.The agency works in more than 100 developing nations and is headquartered in Washington, D.C.Its mission is to boost democratic values across the world and help nations become self-reliant while advancing America's interests abroad.USAID works in a number of different sectors, including food and agriculture, democracy and human rights, the economy, health, and humanitarian aid.The agency helps partner nations achieve their goals through small-enterprise loans, technical assistance, disaster relief, and training.


   Understanding the United States Agency For International Development (USAID)  

The United States Agency for International Development was developed in 1961 by President John F. Kennedy. He created the agency after signing an executive order to advance American interests abroad through development efforts and humanitarian aid. With the global economy still relatively fragile less than two decades after the end of World War II, it was essential for the U.S.'s own prosperity to promote growth in developing countries and to help nations maintain their independence and freedom.



USAID works in more than 100 developing countries spanning the globe in areas such as sub-Saharan Africa, Asia, the Middle East, Latin America, the Caribbean, Europe, and Eurasia. The agency, which has field offices in the areas noted above, is headquartered in Washington, D.C., with organizational units that are called bureaus. Those working in each unit are responsible for programs and activities in a specific country.



The agency's mission and objectives remain the same today. According to the website, USAID's mission is to boost democratic values across the world, helping nations become self-reliant as they progress in their own development. While promoting development and reducing poverty are among its aims, it also promotes democratic governance in recipient nations, and helps counteract the drivers of violence, instability, transnational crime, and other security threats.



The international agency works in a number of different sectors including:



Food and agriculture
Democracy and human rights
Economy and trade
Education
Environmental issues
Gender equality
Health
Humanitarian aid
Water and sanitation
Crises and conflict



Development assistance is not simply the act of giving aid, but of supporting development efforts so that recipient countries become self-reliant. Some examples of the type of assistance USAID provides in reaching these goals are small-enterprise loans, technical assistance, food and disaster relief, and training and scholarships.






The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) is a taxpayer-funded agency, which means it must report to the American government.


   Special Considerations  

The agency reports directly to the United States Congress on certain important matters. This is done through regular reports that the agency submits. These reports are also available on the agency's website in order to remain transparent to the general public.



The budget for the United States Agency for International Development and the U.S. State Department is recommended by the American president for each fiscal year. The request for the 2022 fiscal year was $58.5 billion. This amount included $27.7 billion managed in part or in full by the agency itself. The request furthers the U.S.'s aid to help its partners pursue self-reliance and renew their economic growth. In addition, the budget helps the U.S. protect its interests abroad, among other things.
What Is the United States Aircraft Insurance Group?  

United States Aircraft Insurance Group (USAIG) is the nation's first aviation insurance company, founded in 1928 by World War I flying ace Reed McKinley Chambers and pilot David C. Beebe. The United States Aircraft Insurance Group was founded when Chambers realized a need for aviation insurance after the airline company that he had formed, Florida Airways, faced bankruptcy when four airplanes were lost to storms and one accident in 1926. Florida Airways had earned the first private air mail contract awarded by the United States government.


   Understanding USAIG  

On July 1, 2018, USAIG celebrated its 90th anniversary. The insurance company is credited with furthering aviation by insuring historic events such as the first B-52 bomber flight, the Boeing 707 prototype, the 1969 lunar module flight, the Boeing 747's first commercial flight, and the development and testing of General Dynamics' F-111A fighter jet. In 1968, USAIG's founder Reed Chambers broke the sound barrier while flying in a Convair F-106 Delta Dart. USAIG also is active in promoting safety in flying, and publishes a series of Safety First posters several times each year.


   USAIG Today  

"USAIG is neither a single insurance company nor a corporation. It’s a pool of member firms, all highly rated property and casualty insurance and reinsurance companies. We’re proud to say that our members all carry A.M. Best ratings ranging from A to A++," the company notes on its website. "United States Aircraft Insurance Group and Canadian Aircraft Insurance Group each comprise a pool of highly rated property-casualty insurers. United States Aviation Underwriters, a licensed New York agent, serves as manager for USAIG. USAU’s Canadian subsidiary manages the CAIG pool. Every policy written through USAIG or CAIG uses capacity that is admitted in all 50 United States or throughout Canada."



Each member company must meet minimum ratings requirements – at least an “A” rating with either A.M. Best or Standard & Poor’s and hold a required statutory surplus of $1 billion or greater. In addition, we go the extra step of requiring each member company, through a security agreement, to fund a trust account to meet 100 percent of their respective net liabilities, the company stated.



The company's line of coverages includes: Corporate aviation, commercial aviation, pleasure and business aircraft, helicopters, airlines, airport liability, and aviation products liability. 



In 1965, USAIG designed and implemented the first insurance policy for an international communications satellite – the COMSAT “Early Bird.” In 2015, it issued first small Unmanned Aircraft Systems (sUAS) policy.
What Is the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA)?  

The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) is the federal agency that proposes programs and implements policies and regulations related to American farming, forestry, ranching, food quality, and nutrition.



President Abraham Lincoln founded the USDA in 1862, when about half of all Americans lived on farms. The department now has 29 agencies with wide-ranging responsibilities, from food safety inspections to economic development for rural communities.





Key Takeaways

USDA stands for U.S. Department of Agriculture and is a federal agency that Abraham Lincoln founded in 1862.The USDA is responsible for overseeing farming, ranching, and forestry industries, as well as regulating aspects of food quality and safety and nutrition labeling.The USDA is further tasked with administering several social welfare programs including free school lunches and food stamps.


   What Does the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Do?  

The USDA is made up of 29 agencies and offices, which include valuable resources like the Forest Service, the Center for Nutrition Policy and Promotion, and the National Agricultural Library.  Its programs help provide the following services, among others: broadband access in rural areas; disaster assistance to farmers, ranchers, and rural residents; soil, water, and other natural resource conservation to landowners; wildfire prevention; and agricultural research and statistics.



The USDA also is responsible for several social welfare programs, including: school meal nutrition; nutrition education; food assistance for women, infants, and children (WIC); and the food stamp program (Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP).



The USDA is vital in helping to keep America's farmers and ranchers in business and making sure that the nation's commercial supply of meat, poultry, and egg products is safe, wholesome, and properly labeled. It also helps to support and ensure the health and care of animals and plants and the health of the land through sustainable management.



The head of the USDA is the secretary of agriculture. Second in charge is the deputy secretary of agriculture, who oversees the department’s daily operations and budget. Undersecretaries oversee the divisions for rural development, food safety, and other areas, with nearly 100,000 employees who serve at more than 4,500 locations across the country and abroad.






The USDA also works to improve the economy and quality of life in all of rural America.


   USDA in Rural Development  

One of the USDA's main tasks is in the area of rural development, especially rural housing. The USDA gives financial assistance for purchasing and refinancing rural homes through USDA Rural Development. It provides direct loans to very-low-income borrowers who want to purchase a rural home, guaranteed loans to moderate-income homebuyers, and loans and grants for rural home improvements and repairs.



USDA Rural Development includes three agencies that provide assistance to rural families and communities. In addition to its housing program, it has a utilities program and a business program.

What Is United States Government Life Insurance (USGLI)?  

United States Government Life Insurance (USGLI) is a type of life insurance that was offered by the United States government between 1919 and 1951. This measure, which was originally intended to support veterans who served during World War I, formed part of a broader set of policies known as the War Risk Insurance program.





Key Takeaways

USGLI was a U.S. government program to support the healthcare needs of American soldiers.It was created in 1919 in response to the country's entry into World War I.The successor to the USGLI is known as the Service Member Group Life Insurance program.


   How United States Government Life Insurance (USGLI) Works  

The purpose of USGLI was to support American soldiers who may have been unable to obtain life insurance at affordable rates from private insurers. After all, life insurance companies must set their insurance premiums based on the expected frequency and cost of the claims made by their policyholders. Since soldiers are exposed to a much higher risk of injury or death as compared to other occupations, the premiums charged to them under a private insurance plan would likely be very high.



To help support soldiers, the United States government created a series of policies called the War Risk Insurance program. One of the central pillars of this program was USGLI, which effectively subsidized the cost of life insurance for American soldiers. The premiums paid under this program were deposited to the United States Treasury and were used to cover the claims made by its policyholders.



The USGLI program entitled all active military personnel to a life insurance policy payable by the federal government in the case of death or disability caused by war. The maximum face amount of a USGLI policy was $10,000. The program was closed on April 25, 1951. War risk insurance proved to be extremely popular. During World War I, more than four million policies were issued.


   Real World Example of United States Government Life Insurance (USGLI)  

USGLI was introduced in 1919, as a response to the United States entering World War I. As of 2013, there were approximately 8,000 active policies remaining, with the policy holder's average age of 88. Since Jan. 1, 1983, all USGLI policies have been paid-up, with no further premiums required.



The modern successor of the USGLI program is Service Member Group Life Insurance. Through this life insurance program, United States military personnel can receive insurance coverage for the duration of their service in the military, with the premium payments deducted from their regular pay. The term of the insurance varies depending on their length of service, with additional coverage granted for the 120 days following their departure from service.
What Is the United States Natural Gas Fund (UNG)?  

The United States Natural Gas Fund (UNG) is an exchange traded fund (ETF) with the stated goal of following the movement of natural gas prices. It is the largest natural gas ETF with shares available on the NYSE Arca. The fund provides access to investing in natural gas without having to invest in the futures market, which is a complicated and risky route for the regular investor.





Key Takeaways


The United States Natural Gas Fund (UNG) is a natural gas ETF whose goal is to track the percentage movements of the natural gas futures contract on the NYMEX.
The NYMEX natural gas contract is the Henry Hub Natural Gas futures, the primary U.S. benchmark for natural gas.
The ETF is listed on the NYSE Arca and invests in natural gas futures, swaps, and forwards. It is the largest natural gas ETF.
The performance of the ETF has been poor, given the consistent drop in prices of Henry Hub, as the U.S. shale industry grows and adversely impacts Henry Hub prices.



   Understanding the United States Natural Gas Fund (UNG)  

Before ETFs became widespread, investors had to invest in futures to gain exposure to natural gas, which is much more complicated than buying or selling stock on an exchange. With the advent of ETFs, investors became able to easily invest in natural gas without the risk of having to buy or sell futures. It is having commodity-like exposure without directly investing in the commodity.



UNG is the largest natural gas ETF with a futures base. Its investment goal aims for the daily percentage changes of its net asset value (NAV) to mirror the daily percentage changes of the price of natural gas delivered to Henry Hub, Louisiana. This is measured with the Henry Hub/natural gas futures contract on the NYMEX. Henry Hub is the largest gas hub in terms of trading volumes and the benchmark for U.S. gas futures.


  Falling Prices  

Henry Hub gas prices have been falling with the U.S. shale boom, which has been reflected in the performance of UNG. The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) believes that prices will increase in the second quarter of 2020 as gas production will slow down and demand for gas will increase for power generation needs.



UNG invests primarily in natural gas futures contracts but also in natural gas-related futures as well as forwards and swaps. The investments are "collateralized by cash, cash equivalents, and US government obligations with remaining maturities of two years or less."



The United States Natural Gas Fund (UNG) was introduced in April 2007 by Victoria Bay Asset Management (now known as United States Commodity Funds, LLC) and the American Stock Exchange. It is managed by United States Commodity Funds.


   Snapshot of the United States Natural Gas Fund (UNG)  

As of Feb. 12, 2020, UNG has the following profile:



Net assets: $530.8 millionAverage volume: 4,667,496Expense ratio: 1.28%One year performance: -40%Previous close: 14.03Top holdings: Futures contract on Natural Gas Futures Jan 20 (48.5%); United States Treasury Bills (1.5%)
What Is UST?  

UST is the abbreviation for the United States Treasury, the federal government division that manages U.S. finances. UST is commonly used to reference debt that is issued by the United States.





Key Takeaways

UST is the abbreviation for the United States Treasury, the federal government division that manages U.S. financesUST is commonly used to reference debt that is issued by the United States.Organizations under the purview of the UST include the IRS, U.S. Mint, the Bureau of Public Debt, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax Bureau.UST securities are presumed to have little to no risk of default.


   Understanding UST  

The UST issues securities to raise money to run the federal government. Some of the government branches operating under the UST umbrella include the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), the U.S. Mint, the Bureau of the Public Debt, and the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax Bureau. In addition to treasury bills (T-bills), the U.S. Treasury issues notes, bonds, floating-rate notes (FRN), and U.S. Savings Bonds.



Traders use the phrases "UST yields" to refer to Treasury yields or "UST curve" to refer to the Treasury yield curve concerning asset pricing. The U.S. Treasury is the department of government that is responsible for issuing debt in the form of Treasury bonds, bills, and notes.



In addition to marketable securities, there are also non-marketable UST securities. These securities are not transferable; they cannot be traded on an exchange. UST savings bonds fall into this group.



The function of the U.S. Department of Treasury is the management of money and cash flow for the federal government. It manages the sources and uses of funds. It also works in conjunction with the Federal Reserve to develop economic policy.



Formally established in 1789 by the First Session of Congress, the institution came into being before the signing of the Declaration of Independence. Alexander Hamilton was the first Secretary of the Treasury, installed on Sept. 11, 1789.


   UST Securities and Asset Pricing  

Much of finance is about the pricing of assets. UST securities are assumed to have virtually no default risk. As a result, these securities are often used as a proxy for a risk-free asset.



UST securities set the benchmark for pricing financial assets. If UST securities are trading at 3%, all other fixed-income securities with the same characteristics will trade at some price higher than 3%. It is assumed that there is no borrower with better credit than the United States.



Measures of risk can be based on metrics such as debt ratios and price volatility. A greater leverage or price volatility leads to a greater risk of either the principal and/or the interest not being paid back. Risk is synonymous with return probabilities, as well. Investments that offer the possibility of making greater returns are priced higher, even if that possibility is slim. A higher level of risk associated with an investment means a higher possible return. A downside to owning UST securities is that, due to the lower yield, the interest payments (an investor's income) will be lower.
What Is a United States Treasury Money Mutual Fund?  

A United States Treasury money mutual fund is a mutual fund that pools money from investors to purchase low-risk government securities. A United States Treasury money mutual fund is a type of mutual fund that invests primarily or exclusively in U.S. government debt, such as Treasury bills and repurchase agreements. U.S. Treasury money mutual funds are a leading investment for investors seeking to preserve principal or invest cash temporarily.





Key Takeaways

A U.S. Treasury money mutual fund invests in low risk and highly liquid investments such as U.S. Treasury bills.These funds are ideal for investors seeking stable investments that preserve invested principal.Money mutual funds are regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which stipulates rules regarding maturity, credit quality, and liquidity of securities.


   Understanding a United States Treasury Money Mutual Fund  

U.S. Treasury money mutual funds are one of the industry’s best low-risk investments. These mutual funds typically invest in U.S. Treasury bills and are highly stable and liquid. These funds are generally classified as either money market funds or found in low-risk fixed income categories. Treasury bills are secured by the full faith and credit of the United States Treasury, which helps to make these portfolios reliable sources of low-risk returns due to the country’s developed economy and political stability.


   U.S. Government Money Market Funds  

Money managers across the industry offer money market mutual funds that fully invest in U.S. Treasuries. U.S. government money market mutual funds follow standard accounting principles that help to keep their net asset value at $1 per share at amortized cost rather than market value. These funds register as money market funds and are governed primarily by Rule 2a-7 of the Investment Company Act of 1940.﻿﻿



The rule stipulates the type of quality the funds can invest in, ensuring that only the highest-rated debt is included. Rules cover the maturity, credit quality, and liquidity of the securities invested. Under the rule, in regards to maturity, the average dollar-weighted maturity cannot exceed 60 days. Under liquidity rules, 10% of assets must be able to be converted into cash within one day, 30% within five days, and no more than 5% can be held in securities that take longer than a week to convert into cash.﻿﻿



Rules and regulations for money market funds have been revised to provide even greater security for investors since the 2008 financial crisis when the popular Reserve Primary Fund broke the buck by falling below its $1 net asset value.﻿﻿



Often, U.S. government money market funds managed by brokerage service providers will be offered as cash sweep options or no-transaction-fee funds. Some of the most popular U.S. government money market funds include:



Vanguard Treasury Money Market Fund (VUSXX)



Fidelity Treasury Only Money Market Fund (FDLXX)



American Century Capital Preservation Fund (CPFXX)


   U.S. Government Mutual Funds  

Many investment managers across the industry also offer U.S. government mutual funds that are not characterized by the money market designation but offer many of the same benefits. These funds can offer slightly higher returns than money market funds with generally the same risk. U.S. government mutual funds can include short, intermediate, and long-term durations, with longer-term durations potentially offering enhanced returns. Some of the most popular U.S. government mutual funds include:



Eaton Vance Short Duration Government Income Fund (EALDX)



Commerce Short Term Government Fund (CFSTX)



Federated Hermes Total Return Government Bond Fund (FTRGX)



Fidelity Intermediate Treasury Bond Index Fund (FUAMX)



Vanguard Extended Duration Treasury Index Fund (VEDTX)



Fidelity Long-Term Treasury Bond Index Fund (FNBGX)
What Was the United States V. The South-Eastern Underwriters Association?  

The term United States v. The South-Eastern Underwriters Association refers to a landmark U.S. Supreme Court case involving the federal antitrust statute and the insurance industry. The case was decided on June 5, 1944. The Supreme Court ruled that the industry is subject to regulation by the United States Congress, under the Commerce Clause.﻿﻿ This means that the court determined insurance to be a business that crosses state lines and is, therefore, subject to antitrust laws.﻿﻿ Congress passed a law a year later exempting the insurance industry from federal scrutiny.﻿﻿





Key Takeaways

The United States v. The South-Eastern Underwriters Association was a 1944 Supreme Court case that ruled the insurance industry should be subject to federal regulation.The ruling gave lawmakers authority over interstate and international commerce, including insurance policies sold out of state.Congress passed the McCarran-Ferguson Act in 1945, which exempted the insurance industry from most federal regulation.Passed in 2021, the Competitive Health Insurance Reform Act of 2020 allows federal authorities to take action against insurers that engage in anticompetitive behavior.


   Understanding the U.S. v. The South-Eastern Underwriter Association  

The insurance industry is an important part of the financial sector. But there have been questions about how insurers should be regulated, largely because these companies do business in multiple states. The debate of whether insurers should be regulated on a state or federal level became key for lawmakers in the early 20th century.



The case of U.S. vs. The South-Eastern Underwriter Association came before the Supreme Court on appeal from a Northern District of Georgia court. The South-Eastern Underwriters Association had control of 90% of fire and other insurance markets in six southern states. This was believed to have given the company an unfair monopoly, brought on through price fixing.﻿﻿



The case focused on whether insurance was a type of interstate commerce that should fall under the United States Commerce Clause and the Sherman Antitrust Act, which was passed into law in 1890 and outlawed monopolies of any kind.﻿﻿ The Supreme Court held that insurers that conducted significant portions of their business across state lines actually engaged in interstate commerce. The ruling held that the industry could be regulated by federal law.﻿﻿



The following year, Congress made a move to overturn the Supreme Court ruling when it passed the McCarran-Ferguson Act. The Act prescribed that insurance regulation was a matter for individual states to decide—not the federal government. The McCarran-Ferguson Act, therefore, exempted the insurance industry from most federal regulations, including antitrust laws.﻿﻿


   Special Considerations  

The McCarran-Ferguson Act is commonly thought of as a form of regulation. But the Act neither regulates the insurance industry, nor requires states to regulate the products offered by insurance companies. Rather, it offers an "Act of Congress," which does not clearly aim to regulate the "business of insurance" by not preempting state laws or regulations that do regulate insurance transactions.﻿﻿






The McCarran-Ferguson Act does not regulate the insurance industry.



Competition for interstate insurance remains a key element of health care reform. In February 2010, the House of Representatives voted to amend the McCarran–Ferguson Act by passing the Health Insurance Industry Fair Competition Act.﻿﻿ Similar attempts to update insurance antitrust provisions are ongoing with efforts to replace or amend the Affordable Care Act (ACA), also known as Obamacare.



Former President Donald Trump also signed the Competitive Health Insurance Reform Act of 2020 into law on Jan. 13, 2021.﻿﻿ The bill, which was introduced by Rep. Peter DeFazio (D-OR), places restrictions on the insurance industry, allowing federal authorities to take action against companies that engage in any behavior that may stifle competition, such as price-fixing.﻿﻿ Although it was lauded by the Department of Justice, the industry objected, saying it added unnecessary financial burden and red tape on insurers.﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿
What Is a Unitholder?  

A unitholder is an investor who owns one or more units in an investment trust or master limited partnership (MLP). A unit is equivalent to a share, or piece of interest. Unitholders are afforded specific rights that are outlined in the trust declaration, which governs the trust's actions.



The most common type of unit trust is an investment vehicle that pools funds from investors to purchase a portfolio of assets. These unit trusts invest in many asset classes of stocks (large-cap, small-cap, domestic, international, etc.), bonds (investment grade, high-yield, emerging market, tax-free, etc.), real estate, and other securities.





Key Takeaways

A unitholder is an investor who owns units in an investment trust or master limited partnership (MLP).The most common type of unit trust is an investment vehicle that pools funds from investors to purchase a portfolio of assets.Unitholders may also have an interest in a master limited partnership (MLP), a tax-advantaged investment vehicle.Income that unitholders receive is taxed as pass-through income.


   Understanding Unitholders  

There is a whole spectrum of risk/reward choices for investors in these unit trusts. The unitholder gains exposure to a pool of securities and is free to trade units at any time, though a unit trust tends to be less liquid than, say, an exchange-traded fund (ETF), and the price of the traded unit may not be equivalent to net asset value (NAV) of the unit trust per share.



Unitholders may also have an interest in a master limited partnership (MLP), an investment vehicle that offers significant tax advantages to both general and limited partners. Most MLPs are in the energy sector. For example, pipeline companies prefer the MLP structure to offer preferential tax treatment of cash flows to partners and unitholders. What primarily attracts unitholders is the potential for high-income yields of MLPs.



One difference between unitholders and shareholders is that while unitholders may have some voting rights, those rights are often quite a bit more limited than those of corporate shareholders.


   Unitholder Taxation  

For unit trusts, unitholders pay income taxes on interest, dividends, and capital gains distributed to them if the units are held in a taxable account. The unit trusts send all unitholders IRS Form 1099, typically 1099-INT or 1099-DIV.



In the case of master limited partnerships (MLPs), each unitholder's proportion of income, gains, deductions, losses, and credits is reported on a Schedule K-1. If the net amount is positive the unitholder pays tax on a pass-through basis whether or not a cash distribution was actually received; if there is a net loss, the amount can be carried forward and used against future income, but only from the same MLP.



The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, passed in 2017, introduced a new tax deduction for pass-through businesses, including unit investment trusts. The qualified business income deduction, or 199A deduction, allows non-corporate taxpayers to deduct up to 20% of the qualified business income from each pass-through business they own.


   Example of a Unitholder  

Let's say an investor is interested in being a unitholder in a real estate investment trust (REIT). The investor does their due diligence and decides to purchase shares in Prologis, Inc. (PLD), the largest real estate company in the world because they like the assets in the portfolio and its potential for growth in the current market environment. All income that the unitholder receives will be taxed as pass-through income.
What Is a Unitized Endowment Pool (UEP)?  

A unitized endowment pool (UEP) is a form of endowment investing that allows multiple endowments to invest in the same pool of assets. Each endowment owns individual units in a UEP and investors generally see their returns monthly. New endowments entering the pool can buy in by receiving units in the pool valued as of a specific buy-in date.





Key Takeaways

A unitized endowment pool (UEP) is a type of investment used by endowments that allow multiple groups to invest in the same basket of assets.Each endowment owns units in the UEP, with the value of each unit determined as of a specific buy-in-date.UEPs are similar to mutual funds, except they are only available to endowments, not to the public.UEPs allow the individual endowments to have access to greater diversification by teaming up with a number of other firms.The benefits UEPs provide to endowments include access to less liquid investments, access to complex financial markets, such as those of emerging economies, and the ease of selling illiquid investments.


   Understanding a Unitized Endowment Pool (UEP)  

A unitized endowment pool (UEP) is sort of a mutual fund, but it’s on a bigger scale and specifically for endowments, as opposed to retail investors.



While even small endowments often have a substantial amount of cash to invest, it’s sometimes beneficial to pool together with other endowments for diversification. UEP units serve to clearly segregate each endowment's share in the pool. For example, a UEP with a market value of $10 billion may have 100,000 units worth $100,000 each and split those units among multiple endowments.



Unitized endowment pools are one of three main investing options for endowment funds. Some choose to invest in UEPs exclusively. Others hire external managers directly. The largest tend to hire internal managers to attempt to grow endowment assets. A few use a combination of all three.



The number of endowments that invest in unitized endowment pools and other outside investment managers, as opposed to making all decisions in-house, tends to run in cycles. In the decade following the 2007-2009 financial crisis, for example, more midsize- and large endowments hired management expertise from the outside, in general, in an effort to focus on controlling costs and putting more focus on risk management.


   Benefits of a UEP  

Some UEPs provide access to less-liquid securities such as private equity and stakes in timberland. Each tends to have attractive returns over time, but also carries significant liquidity risks.



A smaller endowment might not own these assets outside of a unitized endowment pool because they don’t have the internal expertise to manage these assets. Moreover, selling units of a unitized endowment pool with a share of these types of assets is sometimes easier and faster than trying to sell illiquid assets directly.






The school with the largest endowment is Harvard University, with an endowment of $42 billion in 2020.



Some unitized endowment pools also have more experience with emerging-markets equity and debt than an endowment fund’s own team. Endowment funds tend to own at least some of these types of assets, as many plan to invest for very long time horizons; even longer than the average retail investor saving for retirement.



Many endowments choose to take on more risk in search of higher potential rewards that have a better chance of beating inflation over time. This could be viewed as a downside but it depends on each endowment's risk tolerance and investment time horizon.




What Are the Three Types of Endowments?
In general, the three types of endowments are true endowments, also known as permanent endowments, quasi-endowments, also known as Funds Functioning as Endowments (FFE), and term endowments.




What Is a Unitized Investment?
A unitized investment is a type of pooled investment structure that allows investors to purchase units in a pooled investment vehicle, such as an investment fund. Each investor owns a portion of the investment vehicle through their units. Unitized investments typically have a specific investment concentration or strategy.




What Is an Endowment?
An endowment is an investment structure for non-profit organizations that allows for their donations to be invested in order to generate returns with the ultimate goal of financing their operations.
What is a Unitized Fund  

A unitized fund is a type of investment fund structure that uses pooled money to invest with individually reported unit values for investors. Assets in the pool are managed to a specific objective, often with concentration in one stock. Investors are provided with a daily unitized value for their portion of the investment.



Unitized stock funds increase the efficiency of employee stock offerings in benefit plans such as ESOPs. Their unit price can be generally compared to the price of the company's stock. 





Key Takeaways

A unitized fund is a way to pool assets from several investors often in a focused investment such as a single stock.Pensions and employee stock ownership plans (ESOPs) that offer workers company stock often use a unitized fund structure to increase efficiency in managing these shares.Unitized funds will typically hold cash or other assets in a small amount in addition to the focused investment, so that the unit value will often differ slightly from the actual shares by themselves.Insurance companies in the U.K. may also use a unitized fund structure to segregate managed investments on behalf of policyholders.


   How Unitized Funds Work  

Unitized funds are often used in employee benefit plans such as pensions. Employers can offer unitized stock funds that include the company’s publicly traded stock. This type of unitized fund will typically also include some cash. A unitized fund provides for greater efficiency in managing company stock purchase plans offered to investors. Since the fund is composed of company stock with some cash holdings its unit value will vary from the company’s stock share value in the market.



Pension funds may also use a type of unitized structure to offer convertible investments between defined benefit and defined contribution plans. Participants are given the option to set up individual sub-accounts within a unitized structure. This gives investors greater flexibility to transfer and exchange assets within their plan.


   Unitized Funds in Insurance  

Insurance companies may also use unitized funds. The fund represents a collective investment with unit-linked fund options for the investors. Funds invested are associated with investment towards an insurance plan. In a unit-linked fund, the investor designates investment in a specified unit-linked fund which is part of a broader collective investment. Unit-linked fund investments vary across the fund however the investments of many unit-linked funds are managed collectively together. An investor receives reporting on their individual unit-linked fund investment which may vary from the values of other funds in the collective.



The total value of all the funds comprehensively is reported as the total assets for the collective investment. These types of funds can usually be found in offshore financial centers in the UK and the British Isles.


   Unitized Fund Considerations  

Generally, an investment company may also use a special unitized fund structure for fund management if it complies with securities regulation in their individual country. Overall, the structure can provide for efficiency in purchasing shares of securities in the fund. With this type of fund, investors’ assets are pooled and the fund calculates a unit value for each participant. The unit value typically serves as a comparable value or a personal balance for the investor.



Unitized funds are typically offered as an alternative to mainstream investment options. Investors should closely examine the prospectus of these types of funds to understand their structure. They can provide for efficiencies when managing pooled assets investing in concentrated positions. In other cases, they require complex record-keeping and may include high administrative expenses.
What Is Unitranche Debt?  

Unitranche debt or financing represents a hybrid loan structure that combines senior debt and subordinated debt into one loan, allowing banks to compete better against private debt funds. The borrower of this kind of debt typically pays an interest rate that falls in between the interest rates that each type of loan would command individually.



Unitranche debt is typically used in institutional funding deals. It lets the borrower get funding from multiple parties, which can result in decreased costs from multiple issuances, allow for greater fundraising through a single deal process, and facilitate a faster acquisition in a buyout.





Key Takeaways

Unitranche debt is a hybrid model combining different loans into one, with an interest rate for the borrower that sits in between the highest and lowest rate on the individual loans.Unitranche debt is commonly used in institutional funding deals as it allows the borrower to access the funds of multiple parties and potentially close the deal faster.Unitranche debt is comparable to syndicated debt, as both types of loans are structured under an agreement that provides an average cost of debt to the issuer.


   Understanding Unitranche Debt  

Unitranche debt deals can be structured in several ways. The primary focus is on priority repayment levels for the borrowers. Levels of risk can vary substantially in a structured unitranche debt deal, with borrowers agreeing to various priority levels for repayment in the case of default.



Unitranche debt may also be compared to syndicated debt. Both types of debt are structured under an overarching issuance agreement that provides an average cost of debt to the issuer.






Important: Unitranche debt is a type of structured debt that collects funding from multiple participants with varying term structures.



Structured unitranche debt will divide pieces of the structured debt vehicle into tranches, each of which has its own class designation. The issuer of the debt typically works with a large investment bank, or group of investment banks, to provide the structuring of the debt in an underwriting process. The underwriters will determine and document all of the terms of each tranche including details on its interest payments, interest rate, duration, and seniority.



Seniority is typically the primary factor influencing the terms of each tranche level. The tranches of the debt can be a dividend and represented by class level names, such as the year of issuance followed by a letter. For example, a unitranche vehicle with four tranches could be structured as 2019-A, 2019-B, 2019-C, and 2019-D, providing an identifier for lenders who want to invest in the vehicle.



Underwriters structure the tranches by seniority with the lowest risk tranches having the highest seniority for repayment in the case of default. These tranches are also known as secured tranches. Each tranche will have differing levels of seniority if the issuer defaults.



Some unitranche vehicles may also rate various tranches to support the marketing and disclosure of tranche sales. Underwriters can also structure each tranche with varying terms. Individual tranches can thus be customized and created with different provisions that are favorable for the issuer. Provisions may include call rights, full repayment at the principal with no coupon and floating versus fixed rates.


   Unitranche Debt vs. Syndicated Loan  

In some cases, a syndicated loan may also be considered a type of unitranche debt. A syndicated loan is similar to a unitranche loan in that it involves multiple lenders making an investment. Syndicated loans also involve underwriters and an extensive underwriting process. In a syndicated loan the lenders all typically agree to similar terms, however, some syndicated loans may include individual loan portions to each lender considered as tranches. Overall, syndicated loans are typically less complex in their structuring than unitranche debt.
What Is Units Per Transaction (UPT)?  

Units per transaction (UPT) is a sales metric often used in the retail sales sector to measure the average number of items that customers are purchasing in any given transaction. The higher the UPT, the more items customers are purchasing for every visit.





Key Takeaways

Units per transaction (UPT) is a sales metric used to measure the average number of items that customers purchase in any given transaction.The higher the units per transaction (UPT), the more items customers are purchasing for every visit.Getting people to buy more suggests a company has a decent understanding of its customers. It also means extra revenue and potentially more leverage to push up prices and profit margins.Retailers often make units per transaction (UPT) a key performance indicator (KPI).A basic unit per transaction (UPT) is calculated by dividing the number of items purchased by the number of transactions for the period.It is advised that units per transaction (UPT) be calculated later on a daily basis as opposed to a quarterly basis or seasonal basis for the most accurate data.


   Understanding Units Per Transaction (UPT)  

Retailers want people who enter and browse their stores and websites to buy as many items as possible. Happy shoppers are more likely to fill up their baskets with goods, purchasing stuff they set out to buy, as well as add-ons and other extra items sold to them when in-store or surfing online.



Many experts agree that increasing units per transaction (UTP) is often what determines success versus failure for a small- to a mid-size retailer. Getting customers to buy more suggests that the company is engaged and has a decent understanding of its customers. It also means extra revenue and potentially more leverage to push up prices and profit margins. It should come as little surprise then that retailers often make units per transaction (UPT) a key performance indicator (KPI).


   Calculating Units Per Transaction (UPT)  

A basic unit per transaction (UPT) is calculated by simply dividing the number of items purchased by the number of transactions for the period. However, there is a range of additional factors to consider that might influence how the figure is computed.



Units per transaction (UPT) can achieve a number of objectives. They might be measured across individual stores to identify market areas where customers tend to purchase different numbers of items when they shop. Retailers can also track items per sale by an employee in order to measure sales performance, or keep tabs on units per transaction (UPT) company-wide for a wider picture of overall sales patterns.



Another important consideration to make is whether to calculate units per transaction (UPT) on a day-by-day basis, seasonal basis, or over a longer period of time. It is generally advisable to collect data on items sold and transactions daily. From there, the data can be tweaked to focus on longer time periods with greater accuracy.



As an example of UPT, company A can compare the sales performance of two employees. The first employee made 30 sales with a total of 105 items, while a second employee sold 105 items in 35 sales. Thus, units per transaction (UPT) for the first employee is 3.5, and units per transaction (UPT) for the second employee is 3.0.


   Real Life Example  

In the first quarter of 2019, Macy’s Inc. (M) reported a 5.7% increase in transactions, compared to the first quarter of 2018. A closer look at all the figures reveals that this impressive headline number might be slightly misleading. Why? Because average units per transaction (UPT) fell 2.2%.



What this tells us is that a chunk of the department store’s transaction growth was boosted by loyal customers spreading out purchases more than usual, as opposed to Macy’s attracting an influx of new shoppers. Perhaps the company’s relatively new loyalty program, which offers top spenders free shipping regardless of how little they order, had something to do with its customers not feeling inclined to buy items all in one go.



Analyzing units per transaction (UPT) can help companies adjust operational factors, advertising methodologies, and even store layouts, to entice customers into making more purchases and boosting units per transaction (UPT).
What Is Unisex Legislation?  

In the insurance industry, the term “unisex legislation” refers to laws and legal decisions that made it illegal for insurance companies to charge different rates to men and women within certain types of insurance. The term is mainly used in relation to the group insurance policies which companies offer to their employees.





Key Takeaways


Unisex legislation are laws and legal decisions restricting the ability of insurance companies to set different insurance rates for men and women.
The insurance industry has argued that such practices are reasonable if the gender differences are genuinely relevant for the purposes of assessing the likelihood of future claims.
The main area in which we see the influence of unisex legislation is in employer-sponsored group health insurance plans.



   How Unisex Legislation Works  

To determine a reasonable premium, insurers consider various factors that would be relevant for predicting the likelihood of future claims. For example, in the case of health insurance, an insurer might look at the age of the insured person, as well as their lifestyle habits. Personal factors, such as their gender and ethnicity, might also be considered if those factors have been shown to be correlated with different health outcomes.



For this reason, it is common for men and women to receive different insurance premiums when shopping for health insurance. Women, for example, have longer average life expectancies than men, which might result in lower insurance premiums. Another example can be seen in automobile insurance, where men in general—and young men in particular—tend to pay higher insurance rates than women, due to being perceived as riskier drivers.



Some of these practices, however, have come under legal challenges. Unisex legislation states that all people, regardless of gender, must be treated the same by insurance companies when setting rates and product offerings. The state of Montana took the lead with unisex legislation, passing the first unisex law in the nation in 1985 which prevented insurance companies from using gender when establishing rates and benefits. Today, perhaps the most common area in which we see the influence of unisex legislation is in employer-sponsored group health plans. In these plans, the rates paid by men and women are typically the same, in order to comply with unisex legislation.


   Real World Example of Unisex Legislation  

An area of controversy when the law first passed was with life insurance policies, in which insurance companies were no longer allowed to use gender as a basis for setting premiums or benefits, just as the use of race, color, religion, marital status, and national origin were prohibited. The insurance companies argued that women were hurting themselves as life insurance policies typically cost less for women, given they outlive men on average. But the women counter-argued that men were receiving larger payouts on their policies.



One of the most complex areas of interpretation of unisex legislation today is seen in transgender cases. Many health plans still exclude coverage for a sex change or sex reassignment surgery. Depending on what future lawsuits may transpire, it may be the case that insurance companies will eventually be prohibited from excluding sex reassignment surgeries and other gender-related operations in this manner.
What Is Unissued Stock?  

Unissued stock are company shares that do not circulate, nor have they been put up for sale to either employees or the general public. As such, companies do not print stock certificates for unissued shares. Unissued shares are normally held in a company's treasury. Their number typically has no bearing on shareholders.





Key Takeaways

Unissued stock is a class of company shares that are not circulating or up for sale by the company on the market.The number of unissued shares can be calculated by subtracting the outstanding shares plus treasury stock shares from the total number of authorized shares.Unissued shares may be irrelevant to current stockholders because they do not qualify for voting rights nor receive dividends.Unissued stock may indicate the potential for events or developments that may dilute a company's earnings per share.


   Understanding Unissued Stock  

When a company goes public, it authorizes a certain number of shares to be created in its charter or articles of incorporation. These shares are referred to as authorized stock. Authorized stock is comprised of all stock that has been created, including shares up for sale to investors and issued to employees, as well as any shares not up for sale. The former is called outstanding stock, while the latter is referred to as unissued shares. Companies do not print up certificates for unissued stock, which are held in the company's treasury.



The number of unissued shares can be calculated by taking total shares authorized for issuance and subtracting this from total shares outstanding, plus treasury stock from the total number of authorized shares. Treasury stocks are the shares repurchased by a company.



Unissued shares are not relevant to stockholders, in the sense that these shares do not qualify for voting rights nor do they receive dividends. But this can change, as they represent the possibility for a dilution in the value of existing shareholder ownership—and thus share value—should the company choose to issue additional shares of stock in the future.






Unissued stock may dilute existing shareholder value if a company decides to release more stock in the future.



Analysts and investors closely monitor a company's plans for issuance of previously unissued shares. Funding plans that call for issuance of shares could be dilutive to the company's earnings per share (EPS).



Though they represent a potential source of ownership and earnings dilution for investors, unissued shares are not included in fully diluted earnings per share calculations. But earnings per share calculations do take into account the potential for convertible securities to be converted into equity as well as stock options granted but not yet exercised.


   Unissued Stock vs. Treasury Shares  

Unissued stock is generally not the same as treasury stock. Treasury stock represents any shares that have already been issued and sold but have subsequently been repurchased by the company. But the lines between the two may be slightly blurred, as some companies may choose to list these shares as unissued stock.



Companies that choose to list treasury shares as unissued stock have corporate charters that allow for the issuance of a large number of stock shares to provide maximum flexibility in the event future stock sales are needed. A company might disclose in the notes of its financial statements that it has the authorization to issue 10 million shares, but only a fraction of that amount might be both issued and outstanding.



Let's look at a real example. A 2016 8-K filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) by Dollar Tree (DLTR) states: "Shares purchased under the share repurchase authorizations are generally held in treasury or are canceled and returned to the status of authorized but unissued shares."
What Is Universal Banking?  

Universal banking is a system in which banks provide a wide variety of comprehensive financial services, including those tailored to retail, commercial, and investment services. Universal banking is common in some European countries, including Switzerland.



Universal banking became more common in the United States starting in 1999 when the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA) repealed the restrictions preventing commercial banks from offering investment banking services. Proponents of universal banking argue that it helps banks better diversify risk. Detractors think dividing up banking operations is a less risky strategy.





Key Takeaways


Universal banking is a term for banks that offer a variety of comprehensive financial services, including both commercial banking and investment banking services.
Commercial banks typically offer consumer and business services, such as checking and savings accounts, business and personal loans (including mortgages and auto loans), and certificates of deposits (CDs).
Investment banks provide merger and acquisition services for corporations, underwriting services, and brokerage services for institutional and private clients.
Banks in a universal system may still choose to specialize in a subset of commercial or investment banking services, even though they technically can offer much more to their client base.



   How Universal Banking Works  

Universal banks may offer credit, loans, deposits, asset management, investment advisory, payment processing, securities transactions, underwriting, and financial analysis. While a universal banking system allows banks to offer a multitude of services, it does not require them to do so. Banks in a universal system may still choose to specialize in a subset of banking services.



Universal banking combines the services of a commercial bank and an investment bank, providing all services from within one entity. The services can include deposit accounts, a variety of investment services, and may even provide insurance services. Deposit accounts within a universal bank may include savings and checking.



Under this system, banks can choose to participate in any or all of the permitted activities. They are expected to comply with all guidelines that govern or direct proper management of assets and transactions. Since not all institutions participate in the same activities, the regulations in play may vary from one institution to another; however, it is important not to confuse the term "universal bank" with any financial institutions with similar names.






Some of the more notable universal banks include Deutsche Bank, HSBC, and ING Bank; within the United States, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, and JPMorgan Chase qualify as universal banks.


   The History of Universal Banking in the U.S.  

Due to strict regulation, the universal banking system was slow to grow in the United States. During the Great Depression, Congress passed the Glass-Steagall Act as part of the Banking Act of 1933. In a measure to prevent further bank failures, the act prohibited universal banking.



Commercial banks were not allowed to provide investment banking services, such as securities trading and brokerage services. Additionally, the act established the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), an independent federal agency that insures U.S. bank deposits against bank failure.



In 1999, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA) partially repealed the Glass-Steagall Act, thus making it legal for commercial banks to offer investment banking services. The goal of the GLBA was to modernize the financial services industry by allowing financial institutions to expand the products and services they could offer their customers.


  Financial Crisis and Changing Regulations  

Laws impacting universal banking in the U.S. have continued to evolve and change, especially during times of economic upheaval. For example, the 2008 financial crisis caused a number of failures within the investment banking system in the United States. This led to the acquisition or bankruptcy of a variety of institutions. Some notable examples include Lehman Brothers and Merrill Lynch.



In response, Congress enacted the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act in 2010, which restricted the ways in which banks could invest by limiting speculative trading and prohibiting involvement with hedge funds and private equity firms.



Opponents of Dodd-Frank criticized the act for going overboard in reducing the market-making activities of banks. In 2018, Congress enacted the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act (also known as the Crapo Bill), which rolled back some of the Dodd-Frank restrictions.



Despite the evolving rules regarding universal banking, many financial service providers in the U.S. today offer a range of services from banking, loans, mortgages, insurance, and investments either under one roof or through an affiliate network with partner firms.



While developments have removed a number of the barriers to the creation of universal banks in the U.S., they are still not as prevalent as they are across many European countries. The United States has banks that focus purely on investments, which is uncommon in the rest of the world.




What Is an Example of Universal Banking?
Examples of universal banks include JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, UBS, BNP Paribas, Deutsche Bank, and Barclays. All of these banks provide a gamut of banking services, from retail banking to investment banking.




What Is the Advantage of Universal Banking?
The advantage of universal banking for a customer is that it allows a customer to manage all of their finances under one roof. For example, a person can have a checking account, a loan, a mortgage, asset management services, and other investment services all at one institution. Sometimes they receive benefits or discounts for doing so. For banks, it allows them to make more money by providing a variety of different services and charging for them—multiple revenue streams.




What Is a Disadvantage of a Universal Bank?
Disadvantages of universal banks include risk concentration for the client and a conflict of interest in certain areas between bank and investor, primarily in regards to interest earned on deposits.


   The Bottom Line  

Universal banking refers to when banks provide a wide array of financial services, including commercial banking, investment banking, and retail banking. Regulations surrounding what banks can provide have changed over time in the U.S., primarily to protect bank clients while still remaining competitive.
What Is Universal Default?  

The term “universal default” refers to a provision found in some credit cards’ cardholder agreements. According to this provision, the credit card company is permitted to increase the interest rate on the credit card if the cardholder fails to make their minimum monthly payment.



Importantly, credit card companies can also increase the customer’s interest rate if their customer defaulted on a separate credit product, such as a car loan or a mortgage, even if that other loan was extended by an unrelated lender.





Key Takeaways

Universal default is a provision found in some credit card contracts.It provides credit card companies the right to raise their interest rates if the customer defaults on any of their loans, including those from other lenders.Consumer protection imposes limits on the way in which companies can issue such rate increases.


   How Universal Default Works  

Historically, universal default provisions could be used to increase interest rates on the full outstanding balance of credit card debt. However, since the passage of the Credit Card Accountability, Responsibility, and Disclosure (CARD) Act in 2009, credit card companies are only permitted to increase their interest rates on any new purchases made by the customer. This means that customers who fail to make their minimum payments can at least continue paying off their past purchases using their older and lower interest rate, thereby making it easier for them to work their way out of debt.



Although the CARD Act did not prohibit universal default provisions altogether, it did help make them less costly for credit card users. After all, the increased interest rates charged under the universal default provision may be substantially higher than the card’s standard annual percentage rate (APR). These higher rates, which are referred to as the “default APR”, are often 30% or more. Under the terms of the CARD Act, credit card companies must give the customer 45 days’ notice before levying this increased interest rate.



In light of these universal default provisions, customers would be wise to carefully review their cardholder agreements in order to understand what interest rates they might be required to pay in the event of default. After all, a customer who fails to meet their minimum payments might find themselves surprised by the sudden and significant increase in their interest costs. 


   Example of Universal Default  

Linda is a long-time credit card customer at XYZ Financial. On January 1st, she obtained a car loan from ABC Leasing. Over the following months, she struggled to make her car loan payments and failed to make a complete payment in March.



In late April, she received a notice from XYZ Financial stating that her interest rate would be increased in accordance with her cardholder agreement’s universal default provision. In explaining this decision, she was told that her risk profile had changed due to having defaulted on her car loan in the previous month.



Due to the CARD Act, XYZ is prohibited from charging Linda the higher default APR on her existing outstanding credit card debts. However, that higher APR will come into effect for all new debts incurred on the card. For this reason, Linda would be wise to make every effort to always make her monthly credit card payments going forward. Otherwise, her interest expenses could become even more difficult to bear.
What Is Universal Healthcare Coverage?  

Universal healthcare coverage refers to systems in which all residents of a particular geographical area or country have health insurance. An early example of universal healthcare coverage is Germany in the 1880s, when Chancellor Otto von Bismarck introduced a series of bills guaranteeing access to healthcare. Today, most industrialized nations—including France, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom, but not the United States—provide universal healthcare coverage for their citizens.



Although the U.S. leads industrialized nations in healthcare spending, it has worse health outcomes and a smaller percentage of the population is served. Now, the healthcare system is struggling even more under the double burden of the global pandemic and the loss of income from elective surgery and routine medical care that was suspended during the past year. One answer to the this crisis, according to everyone from New York City Mayor Bill De Blasio to the World Health Organization and Pope Francis, is to provide Americans with universal healthcare coverage.





Key Takeaways

Many countries have achieved nearly 100% universal healthcare coverage, meaning that all citizens have access to medical and hospital care.Some countries require that everyone purchase private health insurance or face fines or tax penalties.In single payer systems, the government insures everyone, but medical care is in private hands.In socialized systems the government provides insurance and medical care.


   Understanding Universal Healthcare Coverage  

There are at least three types of systems that can potentially ensure that everyone in a jurisdiction is covered for medical and hospital care. These include requiring or mandating health insurance, providing insurance (but not care) via a single government payer, and socialized medicine, in which both insurance and medical care are managed by the government.


   Types of Universal Healthcare Coverage  
  Required health insurance   

Some governments mandate that all residents buy a health insurance policy or face a fine or penalty. The government may subsidize part of the premiums but most insurance is provided by private companies. Germany’s system, for example, includes both for-profit and not-for-profit insurers. Requiring health insurance has helped some countries, including Germany, the Netherlands, and Switzerland, achieve universal coverage.﻿﻿



In the U.S., the 2010 Affordable Care Act established a similar requirement and system. The law’s original “individual mandate” levied a tax penalty on people who did not purchase health insurance. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) repealed the penalty, starting in 2019.﻿﻿



Some U.S. states (California, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Rhode Island, Vermont) and the District of Columbia levy their own penalties on those who do not buy health insurance. Since 2006, Massachusetts, for example, has required its residents to have health insurance or pay a fine. This has helped encourage insurance rates as high as 97.5% in the state.﻿﻿


  Single-payer insurance systems  

Under a single-payer system, all health costs are paid by the government using tax revenue. This allows countries to control costs, in part, by having the government play a stronger role in negotiating prices for healthcare. Health insurance is universal and offered by a single entity. However, medical care itself is provided by private-sector doctors and hospitals.



Examples of this model include Canada and France. In both of these countries, private-sector insurers also exist, but they play a minor role as providers of supplemental coverage.﻿﻿ ﻿﻿


  National health care systems  

In these systems, both insurance and medical care are provided by the government.



In the United Kingdom's National Health Service, for example, the government owns most of the hospitals and employs medical providers. Sweden's publicly funded system mostly provides care through government providers, though private companies play a limited role. Socialized systems are less common than single-payer ones.﻿﻿ ﻿﻿






The global pandemic has increased pressure on America's very complex and expensive healthcare system, making it more urgent to lower costs and perhaps provide universal healthcare.


   Special Considerations  

In the U.S., the ACA increased the number of insured people, but has not achieved universal healthcare coverage. At the end of 2018, the percentage of U.S. adults without health insurance stood at 13.7%. The other 86% of people have health insurance through a mix of government and private insurance providers.



In the world of employer-based insurance, large companies often use a mix of private and self-insurance to cover a percentage of their employees' health costs.



Also, since 2011, the federal government has provided incentives for private insurers to compete against government programs such as Medicare by providing lower costs and more benefits to enrollees. Some of the best Medicare Advantage plans are excellent examples. Recipients of Medicaid choose a private insurance plan for which state and federal governments pay much of the costs.



This mix of approaches may encourage competition and entrepreneurial opportunities, and offer consumers choice and incentives to try to keep healthcare costs down. But it results in a very expensive healthcare system that falls short in delivering universal care and on many measures of public health.



These issues are likely to be pivotal ones in the party platforms and 2020 presidential campaign.
What Is Universal Life (UL) Insurance?  

Universal life (UL) insurance is a type of permanent life insurance that, like other permanent insurance, has a cash value element and offers lifetime coverage as long as you pay your premiums. Unlike whole life insurance, universal life allows you to raise or lower your premiums within certain limits, and it can be cheaper than whole life coverage. However, if your investments underperform or you underpay for too long, it could affect your death benefit or cause your policy to lapse.





Key Takeaways

Universal life (UL) insurance is a form of permanent life insurance with an investment savings element plus premiums and a death benefit that are flexible.Unlike term life insurance, a UL insurance policy can accumulate cash value.The cash value earns an interest rate set by the insurer, and it can change frequently, although there is usually a minimum rate that the policy can earn.If the investments underperform, your cash value can go down and your premiums could eventually go up.There are no tax implications for policyholders who borrow against the accumulated cash value of their UL policy, although some withdrawals may be taxed.


   How Universal Life (UL) Insurance Works  

UL insurance provides more flexibility than whole life insurance. Policyholders can adjust their premiums and death benefits. UL insurance premiums consist of two components: a cost of insurance (COI) amount and a saving component, known as the cash value.



As the name implies, the COI is the minimum amount of a premium payment required to keep the policy active. It consists of several items rolled together into one payment. COI includes the charges for mortality, policy administration, and other directly associated expenses to keep the life insurance policy in force. COI will vary by policy based on the policyholder’s age, insurability, and the insured risk amount.



Collected premiums in excess of the cost of UL insurance accumulate within the cash value portion of the policy. Over time, the cost of insurance will increase as the insured ages. However, if sufficient, the accumulated cash value will cover the increases in the COI.

   Advantages and Disadvantages of Universal Life Insurance  



Pros

Flexible premiums
Possible flexible death benefit
Potential cash value growth
Allows policy loans



Cons

Risk of large payment requirements or policy lapse
Returns are not guaranteed
Some withdrawals are taxed
Cash value lost at policyholder’s death





   Pros Explained  
  Flexible Premiums  

Unlike whole life insurance policies, which have fixed premiums over the life of the policy, a UL insurance policy generally has flexible premiums—within limits. Policyholders can make payments that are more than the COI. The excess premium is added to the cash value and accumulates interest. Alternatively, if there is enough cash value, policyholders may lower or skip payments without the threat of a policy lapse.


  Possible Flexible Death Benefit  

Your policy may allow you to increase the size of your death benefit, although that may require a medical exam. You may also be able to lower your death benefit to lower your premiums.


  Potential Cash Value Growth  

Like all permanent life insurance, a UL insurance policy can accumulate cash value in something like a savings account. The cash value earns interest based on the current market or the policy’s minimum interest rate, whichever is greater. As it accumulates, policyholders may take out a portion of the cash value in the form of partial withdrawals or loans.


  Allows Policy Loans  

Universal life policyholders may borrow against the accumulated cash value without tax implications. The interest rates on these loans are often lower than rates available for a personal loan, and they don’t require a credit check. However, unpaid loans will reduce the death benefit by the outstanding amount.


   Cons Explained  
  Risk of Large Payment Requirements or Policy Lapse  

While the ability to lower your premiums and to make withdrawals in times of need help make universal life a very flexible insurance type, you have to watch your account carefully. If your cash value falls to zero and your premiums don’t cover the cost of insurance, then your policy can lapse.


  Returns Are Not Guaranteed  

If interest rates drop, your cash value may not perform well. Unlike whole life, universal life cash value does not earn a guaranteed rate. However, most UL policies come with a minimum rate so that your losses are limited.


  Some Withdrawals Are Taxable  

When UL policyholders withdraw some of the cash value, it will be taxable. In general, life insurance is taxed on a first in, first out (FIFO) method, meaning that the policy owner will receive their investment in the contract first before receiving any gains in the policy (or being taxed on those gains). However, if you withdraw more than you’ve paid into the policy, your withdrawals will be taxed.


  Cash Value Lost at Policyholder’s Death  

When a policyholder dies, the insurance company keeps the account’s cash value. Your beneficiaries will be paid just the death benefit, as the policyholder can only use the cash value while they are alive. However, some life insurance policies allow you to increase the death benefit as you build the cash value.

Universal life is a form of permanent life insurance that gives policyholders flexibility in paying premiums, a cash savings component, and a death benefit.



Universal life insurance allows you to borrow against or cash in their savings portion, which grows tax-deferred over your lifetime. Term life provides coverage, often through an employer, for a set number of years, generally 20 or 30, and expires once the term is up. Term life is usually more affordable, with low premiums, but there isn’t a cash component to borrow from or cash in, nor is there a death benefit if you die after the term is up.






UL premium costs may change with interest rates and as the policyholder grows older.



Whole life insurance is also a form of permanent life insurance, with a cash value savings component. An important difference between universal life and whole life insurance, however, is that the UL interest rate is not guaranteed. It is set by the insurer and can change frequently. Whole life insurance premiums are fixed for the life of the policy, whereas universal life premiums can vary.



Cash value and death benefits are guaranteed with whole life, but not with universal life.




What is universal life (UL) insurance, and how does it work?
UL insurance policies are a form of permanent life insurance with flexible premiums. Unlike term life, UL policies can accumulate interest-bearing funds like a savings account. Also, policyholders can adjust their premiums and possibly their death benefit, and those paying extra toward their premium receive interest on that excess.




What is the biggest disadvantage of universal life insurance?
A big disadvantage is that you need to keep an eye on the cash value. If you don’t, then the policy could become underfunded, meaning you’ll have to make big payments to keep the policy active. Also, there is risk that when interest rates drop, your cash value won’t grow as much as you had hoped. However, there is typically a minimum interest rate, so you’re somewhat protected.




Which is better: whole life or universal life?
Both whole life and universal life are forms of permanent life insurance and provide a cash value savings component that policyholders may borrow from or cash out. Whole life offers fixed premiums, while UL premiums may start out lower but are flexible, so they may increase as you age. Depending on the amount of coverage and flexibility that you want in a permanent policy, either form may be a good choice for your situation.




What is the difference between universal life and whole life insurance?
Whole life insurance is more stable because the death benefit will never go down if you pay your premiums, which are fixed monthly amounts. Universal life insurance offers more flexibility, but your death benefit isn’t guaranteed. You can increase or decrease the amount you spend on premiums with universal life, and you may be able to adjust your death benefit with some policies.




Can I cash out my universal life insurance policy?
Yes, you can sell your universal life insurance policy, or you can liquidate the cash value component and cancel the policy, but you may have to pay a surrender fee if you haven’t passed the surrender period.


   The Bottom Line  

Universal life (UL) insurance is a form of permanent life insurance with an investment savings element, loan options, and flexible premiums. UL policies provide the option to raise or lower premiums, within limits, so they can be less expensive than whole life coverage. You just have to be careful that your cash value doesn’t drop so low that either you pay large sums in premiums or the policy lapses.



There are no tax implications for policyholders who borrow against the cash value of their UL insurance policy, but interest will be charged on the loan amount, and any unpaid amounts may be taken from the death benefit. Policyholders should also be careful about withdrawals from the policy, as some may be taxable. As with other forms of permanent life insurance, the insurer will retain the account’s cash value after death.
What Are Universal Market Integrity Rules (UMIR)?  

Universal Market Integrity Rules (UMIR) are a set of rules governing trading practices in Canada. These rules are set out by an independent regulator, the Investment Industry Regulatory Organization of Canada (IIROC). UMIR were established to promote fair, equitable, and efficient markets. Prior to the formation of the UMIR, each individual exchange was responsible for governing its trading practices. By making these practices universal, Canadian exchanges ensure equal fairness and improve investor confidence in all the exchanges.


   Understanding Universal Market Integrity Rules (UMIR)  

The IIROC determines the UMIR. The IIROC is a national self-regulatory organization that oversees all investment dealers and trade on debt and equity marketplaces in Canada. The IIROC writes rules that set high regulatory and investment industry standards such as UMIR, screens all investment advisors employed by IIROC-regulated firms, reviews firms' financial compliance, and sets minimum capital requirements so that firms have sufficient capital for business operations. This oversight reduces the number of bankruptcies from excessive leverage and risky business practices.


   IIROC Compliance Reviews  

The IIROC conducts compliance reviews to check that firms properly supervise the handling of client accounts and that advice and transactions appropriately reflect the client’s needs and instructions. IIROC-approved advisors must follow suitability and “know your client” rules by being familiar with a client’s financial situation, investment needs, objectives, investing experience, and tolerance for risk. The IIROC conducts trading conduct compliance reviews to check trading firms' trade-desk procedures. The reviews assess whether trade-desk procedures comply with (UMIR) and applicable provincial securities law.


   IIROC Market Surveillance  

The IIROC surveys the market and analyzes trading to ensure that trading complies with UMIR and applicable provincial securities law. The IIROC is responsible for identifying misconduct by dealers or firms, approved persons, and other market participants and bringing disciplinary proceedings such as fines, suspensions, and permanent bans or terminations for individuals and firms. The money raised from fines and settlements is added to IIROC’s restricted fund and applied to capital expenditures for regulatory issues, investor and industry education projects, and other uses authorized under IIROC’s Recognition Orders. 



According to the Canadian Securities Exchange (CSE), traders who are members with a good track record with IIROC and who are also registered with a Canadian securities regulatory authority can apply to gain access to trade on the CSE.



The IIROC amends UMIR rules from time to time. For example, in 2015 the IIROC proposed amendments to the rules after a proposal by Canada Securities Administrator (CSA) to clarify the interpretation of a protected order. The CSA proposed that orders that implement a systematic order processing delay, or a “speed bump,” would not be considered protected orders.
What Is a Universe of Securities?  

A universe of securities generally refers to a set of securities that share a common feature. For example, the broad universe of stocks for a U.S. investor will include all listed companies, large and small, and may also include foreign companies listed as American depositary receipts (ADRs). For some investors, a narrower universe may be used that is constrained to only value stocks or those with a market cap above some minimum threshold.





Key Takeaways

A universe of securities refers to the complete set of securities that share some common feature or features.The scope of features used to define a universe of securities can be broad or narrow depending on an individual investor's goals and preferences.Universes of securities often begin at the level of asset class and then become narrower by filtering parameters such as company size, credit quality, type or sector, and so on.


   Understanding Universe of Securities  

Security universes can be used for different purposes. Institutionally, investment managers typically specify a universe of securities that defines some of the investing parameters for a managed fund. Broadly, investors may choose to allocate different portions of their personal portfolio based on various security universes with different risk-reward characteristics.



A universe of securities can be broad or narrow based on the defined parameters, and can vary among different investors or portfolio managers. The investable universe, or market portfolio, includes all tradeable assets. In reality, most investors do not invest so broadly, and so a universe of securities could typically encompass all of the securities in a particular asset class. Within asset classes, universes will typically be focused on factors such as capitalization or industry.



Investors will often look to broad universes of securities when building out a diversified portfolio and may segregate universes by fixed income and equity. An investor with a conservative risk tolerance may be willing to consider any type of fixed income security for a fixed income portion of their portfolio because the risk of loss for fixed income investments is generally lower than other market investments. An investor seeking a slightly higher return and risk may want to focus on the entire universe of equities.



Within the fixed income asset class, there are several universes to consider. Many investors and managed funds segregate fixed income by term to maturity. Generally, shorter-term maturities will have lower interest rate risk, while longer-term maturities have higher interest rate risk. Other universes in fixed income can include government, municipal, or corporate. Further segregation can also create universes by credit quality or geographic location. Oftentimes, a specific index will also form the basis for a universe of securities.



The equity market also has many different segregation parameters for universes. Equities will commonly be divided by market capitalization, which can create large, mid, and small-cap universes. Other universes may include geography, growth, value, or sector. In the equity market, indexes are also commonly used to form the basis for a universe of securities.


   Universe Analysis  

Universes of securities are commonly the focus of research studies and analysis that can help to support all kinds of investors. Active traders focusing their investment strategies on certain universes will often analyze the historical characteristics of a universe of securities for insight on future trades and trading analysis.



Consider a technical trader focusing on small-cap stocks. This trader would want to focus their analysis primarily on a universe of small-cap stocks rather than a broad market universe like the S&P 500 or Russell 3000. To analyze the small-cap universe, they could do historical time series analysis on the Russell 2000 to identify various characteristics and regressive tendencies. A wide variety of software is also available for traders to develop forward-looking forecasted security prices.

What Is an Unlawful Loan?  

An unlawful loan is a loan that fails to comply with—or contravenes—any provision of prevailing lending laws. Examples of unlawful loans include loans or credit accounts with excessively high-interest rates or ones that exceed the legal size limits that a lender is permitted to extend.



An unlawful loan may also be some form of credit or loan that disguises its true cost or fails to disclose relevant terms regarding the debt or information about the lender. This sort of loan is in violation of the Truth in Lending Act (TILA).





Key Takeaways

An unlawful loan is a loan that fails to meet the standards of existing lending laws.Loans that have excessively high-interest rates or exceed the legal size limit are considered unlawful loans.Unlawful loans are also those that do not disclose the true cost or relevant terms of the loan.The Truth in Lending Act (TILA) is a federal law that seeks to protect consumers in their dealings with lenders and creditors.Usury laws govern the amount of interest that can be charged on a loan and are set by each state.


   Understanding an Unlawful Loan  

The term "unlawful loan" is a broad one, as a number of different laws and legislation can apply to borrowing and borrowers. Basically, though, an unlawful loan violates the laws of a geographic jurisdiction, an industry, or government authority or agency.



For example, the Federal Direct Loan Program, administered by the Department of Education, offers government-backed loans to postsecondary students. It sets limits on how much can be borrowed each year, based on what the student's college or university identifies as educational expenses.



Should an institution attempt to falsify that figure to get the student more money, the loan would be unlawful. The government also sets the loans' interest rates and a grace period before repayment begins.



Should a lender or loan servicer try to alter those terms—or charge the student for filling out the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA)—that would also make for an unlawful loan.


   Unlawful Loans and the Truth in Lending Act  

The Truth in Lending Act applies to most types of credit, whether it be closed-end credit (such as an auto loan or mortgage) or open-ended credit (such as a credit card). The Act regulates what companies can advertise and say about the benefits of their loans or services.






The Truth in Lending Act (TILA) is part of the Consumer Credit Protection Act and was signed into law on May 29, 1968.



The Act requires lenders to disclose the cost of the loan to enable consumers to do comparison shopping. The Act also provides for a three-day period in which the consumer may rescind the loan agreement without a financial loss. This provision is intended to protect consumers against unscrupulous lending tactics.



The Act doesn't dictate who can receive or be denied credit (other than general discrimination standards of race, sex, creed, etc). Nor does it regulate the interest rates a lender may charge.


   Unlawful Loans and Usury Laws  

Interest rates fall under the provision and definition of local usury laws. Usury laws govern the amount of interest that can be charged on a loan by a lender based in a certain area. In the U.S., each state sets its own usury laws and usurious rates. So a loan or line of credit is deemed unlawful if the interest rate on it exceeds the amount mandated by state law.



Usury laws are designed to protect consumers. However, the laws that apply are those of the state in which the lender is incorporated, not the state where the borrower lives.


   Unlawful Loans vs. Predatory Loans  

Unlawful loans are often seen as the province of predatory lending, a practice that imposes unfair or abusive loan terms on a borrower, or convinces a borrower to accept unfair terms or unwarranted debt through deceptive, coercive, or other unscrupulous methods. Interestingly, however, a predatory loan may not technically be an unlawful loan.



Case in point: payday loans, a type of short-term personal loan that charges an amount that can equal 300% to 500% of the borrowed sum. Often used by people with poor credit and few savings, payday loans could certainly be considered predatory, taking advantage of those who can't pay urgent bills any other way



But unless the lender's state or municipality expressly sets a cap below such amounts on loan interest or loan fees, the payday loan isn't actually illegal.



If you're considering a payday loan, it might be worth first using a personal loan calculator to determine what the total interest paid will be at the end of the loan to ensure it's within your means to repay it.




Do You Have to Pay Back an Illegal Loan?
If a loan was made illegally then you do not actually have to pay back the loan. If a lender does not have a consumer credit license, it is illegal for them to make a loan. It is not illegal to borrow the money, however. Unlicensed lenders are known as loan sharks. Loan sharks have no legal right to claim the money that you borrowed from them, therefore, you do not have to pay the money back.




What Qualifies as Predatory Lending?
Predatory lending is any lending that takes advantage of the borrower through unfair and abusive practices or loan terms. These can include extremely high-interest rates, high fees, undisclosed costs and terms, and any characteristic that reduces the equity of the borrower.




Can You Go to Jail for Not Paying a Loan?
No, you cannot go to jail for not paying a loan. No type of consumer debt that is unpaid entails an individual going to jail. Not paying a loan will impact your credit score and will be a part of your credit history, hurting your chances of obtaining loans or loans with good rates in the future, but no type of unpaid debt results in the borrower receiving jail time.
What Is Unlevered Beta ?  

Beta is a measure of market risk. Unlevered beta (or asset beta) measures the market risk of the company without the impact of debt.



'Unlevering' a beta removes the financial effects of leverage thus isolating the risk due solely to company assets. In other words, how much did the company's equity contribute to its risk profile.





Key Takeaways

Levered beta (commonly referred to as just beta or equity beta) is a measure of market risk. Debt and equity are factored in when assessing a company's risk profile.Unlevered beta strips off the debt component to isolate the risk due solely to company assets.High debt-to-equity ratio usually translates to an increase in the risk associated with a company's stock.A beta of 1 means that the stock is as risky as the market while betas greater or less than 1 reflect risk thresholds higher or lower than the market, respectively.

   Understanding Unlevered Beta  

Beta is the slope of the coefficient for a stock regressed against a benchmark market index like the Standard & Poor's (S&P) 500 Index. A key determinant of beta is leverage, which measures the level of a company’s debt to its equity. Levered beta measures the risk of a firm with debt and equity in its capital structure to the volatility of the market. The other type of beta is known as unlevered beta.
'Unlevering' the beta removes any beneficial or detrimental effects gained by adding debt to the firm's capital structure. Comparing companies' unlevered betas give an investor clarity on the composition of risk being assumed when purchasing the stock.

Unlevered beta (asset beta)=(1+Equity(1−tax rate)∗Debt​)Levered beta (equity beta)​
Take a company that is increasing its debt thus raising its debt-to-equity ratio. This will lead to a larger percentage of earnings being used to service that debt which will amplify investor uncertainty about future earnings stream. Consequently, the company's stock is deemed to be getting riskier but that risk is not due to market risk.






Isolating and removing the debt component of overall risk results in unlevered beta.



The level of debt that a company has can affect its performance, making it more sensitive to changes in its stock price. Note that the company being analyzed has debt in its financial statements, but unlevered beta treats it like it has no debt by stripping any debt off the calculation. Since companies have different capital structures and levels of debt, an analyst can calculate the unlevered beta to effectively compare them against each other or against the market. This way, only the sensitivity of a firm’s assets (equity) to the market will be factored in.



To 'unlever' the beta, the levered beta for the company has to be known in addition to the company’s debt-equity ratio and corporate tax rate.


   Systematic Risk and Beta  

Systematic risk is the type of risk that is caused by factors beyond a company's control. This type of risk cannot be diversified away. Examples of systematic risk include natural disasters, political elections, inflation, and wars. Beta is used to measure the level of systematic risk, or volatility, of a stock or portfolio.



Beta is a statistical measure that compares the volatility of the price of a stock against the volatility of the broader market. If the volatility of the stock, as measured by beta, is higher, the stock is considered risky. If the volatility of the stock is lower, the stock is said to have less risk.



A beta of one is equivalent to the risk of the broader market. That is, a company with a beta of one has the same systematic risk as the broader market. A beta of two means the company is twice as volatile as the overall market, but a beta of less than one means the company is less volatile and presents less risk than the broader market.


   Example of Unlevered Beta  

BU = BL ÷ [1 + ((1 - Tax Rate) x D/E)]



For example, calculating the unlevered beta for Tesla, Inc. (as of November 2017):



beta (BL) is 0.73Debt to Equity (D/E) ratio is 2.2corporate tax rate is 35%.



Tesla BU = 0.73 ÷ [1 +((1 – 0.35) * 2.2)]= 0.30



Unlevered beta is almost always equal to or lower than levered beta given that debt will most often be zero or positive. (In the rare occasions where a company's debt component is negative, say a company is hoarding cash, then unlevered beta can potentially be higher than levered beta.)



If the unlevered beta is positive, investors will invest in the company's stock when prices are expected to rise. A negative unlevered beta will prompt investors to invest in the stock when prices are expected to decline.




How Can Unlevered Beta Help an Investor?
Unlevered beta removes any beneficial or detrimental effects gained by adding debt to the firm's capital structure. Comparing companies' unlevered betas give an investor clarity on the composition of risk being assumed when purchasing the stock. Since companies have different capital structures and levels of debt, an investor can calculate the unlevered beta to effectively compare them against each other or against the market. This way, only the sensitivity of a firm’s assets (equity) to the market will be factored in.




What Is Beta?
Simply put, beta (ß) is a measure of market risk. More precisely, it is a measure of the volatility—or systematic risk—of a security or portfolio compared to the market as a whole. In statistical terms, it is the slope of the coefficient for a security (stock) regressed against a benchmark market index (S&P 500). Each of these data points represents an individual stock's returns against those of the market as a whole. So, beta effectively describes the activity of a security's returns as it responds to swings in the market.




What Is Levered Beta?
Levered beta measures the risk of a firm with debt and equity in its capital structure to the volatility of the market. A key determinant of beta is leverage, which measures the level of a company’s debt to its equity. So, a publicly traded security's levered beta measures the sensitivity of that security's tendency to perform in relation to the overall market. A levered beta greater than positive 1 or less than negative 1 means that it has greater volatility than the market. A levered beta between negative 1 and positive 1 has less volatility than the market.
What Is Unlevered Cost of Capital?  

Unlevered cost of capital is an analysis using either a hypothetical or an actual debt-free scenario to measure a company's cost to implement a particular capital project (and in some cases used to assess an entire company). Unlevered cost of capital compares the cost of capital of the project using zero debt as an alternative to a levered cost of capital investment, which means using debt as a portion of the total capital required.





Key Takeaways

Unlevered cost of capital is an analysis using either a hypothetical or an actual debt-free scenario to measure a company's cost to implement a particular capital project.Unlevered cost of capital compares the cost of capital of the project using zero debt as an alternative to a levered cost of capital investment.The unlevered cost of capital is generally higher than the levered cost of capital because the cost of debt is lower than the cost of equity.Several factors are necessary to calculate the unlevered cost of capital, which includes unlevered beta, market risk premium, and the risk-free rate of return. If a company fails to meet the anticipated unlevered returns, investors may reject the investment.In general, if an investor believes a stock is high-risk, it will typically be because it has a higher unlevered cost of capital, other aspects being constant.


   Understanding Unlevered Cost of Capital  

When a company needs to raise capital for expansion or other reasons it has two options: (1) debt financing, which is to borrow money through loans or bond issuances, or (2) equity financing, which is the issuance of stock.



The unlevered cost of capital is generally higher than the levered cost of capital because the cost of debt is lower than the cost of equity. Borrowing money is cheaper than selling equity in the company. This is true given the tax benefit related to the interest expense paid on the debt. There are costs associated with levered projects including underwriting costs, brokerage fees, and coupon payments, however.



Nevertheless, over the life of the capital project or the firm's ongoing business operations, these costs are marginal compared to the benefits from the lower cost of debt compared to the cost of equity.





Important

The unlevered cost of capital can be used to determine the cost of a particular project, separating it from procurement costs.



The unlevered cost of capital represents the cost of a company financing the project itself without incurring debt. It provides an implied rate of return, which helps investors make informed decisions on whether to invest. If a company fails to meet the anticipated unlevered returns, investors may reject the investment. In general, if an investor believes a stock is a high risk, it will typically be because it has a higher unlevered cost of capital, other aspects being constant.



The weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is another formula that investors and companies use to determine whether an investment is worth the cost. WACC takes into consideration the entire capital structure of a firm, which includes common stock, preferred stock, bonds, and any other long-term debt.


   Formula and Calculation of Unlevered Cost of Capital  

Several factors are necessary to calculate the unlevered cost of capital, which includes unlevered beta, market risk premium, and the risk-free rate of return. This calculation can be used as a standard for measuring the soundness of the investment.



The unlevered beta represents an investment's volatility as compared to the market. The unlevered beta, also known as asset beta, is determined by comparing the company to similar companies with known levered betas, often by using an average of multiple betas to derive an estimate. The calculation of market risk premium is the difference between expected market returns and the risk-free rate of return.



Once all variables are known, the unlevered cost of capital can be calculated with the formula:



Unlevered Cost of Capital = Risk-Free Rate + Unlevered Beta * (Market Risk Premium)



If the result of the calculation produces an unlevered cost of capital higher than the company's return, then further analysis should be conducted. The comparison of the result to the cost of a company's debt can determine the benefits of incurring debt and utilizing leverage to lower the cost of total capital, including equity and debt.
What Is Unlevered Free Cash Flow (UFCF)?  

Unlevered free cash flow (UFCF) is a company's cash flow before taking interest payments into account. Unlevered free cash flow can be reported in a company's financial statements or calculated using financial statements by analysts.



Unlevered free cash flow shows how much cash is available to the firm before taking financial obligations into account.



UFCF can be contrasted with levered cash flow (LFCF), which is the money left over after all a firm's bills are paid.





Key Takeaways

Unlevered free cash flow (UFCF) is the amount of available cash a firm has before accounting for its financial obligations.Free cash flow (FCF), on the other hand, is the money a company has left over after paying its operating expenses and capital expenditures.UFCF is of interest to investors because it indicates how much cash a business has to expand.UFCF can be contrasted with levered free cash flow which does take into account financial obligations.UFCF is preferred when undertaking discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis.

​UFCF=EBITDA−CAPEX−Working Capital−Taxeswhere:UFCF=Unlevered free cash flow​

The formula for unlevered free cash flow uses earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), and capital expenditures (CAPEX), which represents the investments in buildings, machines, and equipment. It also uses working capital, which includes inventory, accounts receivable, and accounts payable.


   What Does Unlevered Free Cash Flow Reveal (UFCF)?  

Unlevered free cash flow is the gross free cash flow generated by a company. Leverage is another name for debt, and if cash flows are levered, that means they are net of interest payments. Unlevered free cash flow is the free cash flow available to pay all stakeholders in a firm, including debt holders as well as equity holders.



Like levered free cash flow, unlevered free cash flow is net of capital expenditures and working capital needs—the cash needed to maintain and grow the company's asset base in order to generate revenue and earnings. Non-cash expenses such as depreciation and amortization are added back to earnings to arrive at the firm's unlevered free cash flow.



A company that has a large amount of outstanding debt, being highly leveraged, is more likely to report unlevered free cash flow because it provides a rosier picture of the company's financial health.



The figure shows how assets are performing in a vacuum because it ignores the payments made for debt incurred to obtain those assets. Investors have to make sure to consider debt obligations since highly leveraged companies are at greater risk for bankruptcy.






Interest expense often appears with differences in timing between interest accrued and interest paid.


   Levered vs. Unlevered Free Cash Flow (UFCF)  

The difference between levered and unlevered free cash flow is the inclusion of financing expenses. Levered cash flow (LFCF) is the amount of cash a business has after it has met all of its financial obligations, such as interest, loan payments, and other financing expenses. Unlevered free cash flow is the money the business has before paying those financial obligations. 



The difference between the levered and unlevered cash flow is also an important indicator. The difference shows how many financial obligations the business has and if the business is overextended or operating with a healthy amount of debt.



It is possible for a business to have a negative levered cash flow if its expenses are more than what the company earned. This is not an ideal situation, but as long as it's a temporary issue, investors should not be too rattled.





CFF

Cash flow from financing activities (CFF) is a section of a company’s cash flow statement, which shows the net flows of cash that are used to fund the company. Financing activities include transactions involving debt, equity, and dividends.


   Limitations of Unlevered Free Cash Flow (UFCF)  

Companies looking to demonstrate better numbers can manipulate unlevered free cash flow by laying off workers, delaying capital projects, liquidating inventory, or delaying payments to suppliers. All of these actions have consequences, and investors should discern whether improvements in unlevered free cash flow are transitory or genuinely convey improvements in the underlying business of the company.



Unlevered free cash flow is computed before interest payments, so viewing it in a bubble ignores the capital structure of a firm. After accounting for interest payments, the levered free cash flow of a firm may actually be negative, a possible sign of negative implications down the road. Analysts should assess both unlevered and levered free cash flow over time for trends and not give too much weight to a single year.




How Do You Calculate Unlevered Free Cash Flow From Net Income?
Free cash flow is calculated as follows: Free Cash Flow = Net income + Depreciation/Amortization – Change in Working Capital – Capital Expenditure. To arrive at unlevered cash flow, add back interest payments or cash flows from financing.




Why Is Unlevered Free Cash Flow Preferred in Discounted Cash Flows (DCF) Analysis?
Because debt and financing charges are not included in UFCF, it provides a more accurate picture of a company's enterprise value (EV), a measure of a company's total value viewed as a more comprehensive alternative to equity market capitalization. This makes it easier to conduct discounted cash flow analysis (DCF) across different investments in order to make like comparisons.




Why Don't You Take Out Interest Expense in UFCF?
Unlevered means to remove consideration of leverage, or debt. Since firms must pay financing and interest expenses on outstanding debt, unlevering removes that consideration from analysis. Therefore, you do not deduct the interest expense in computing UFCF.




What Is Unlevered Free Cash Flow Margin?
Cash flow margins are ratios that divide a cash flow metric by overall sales revenue. UFCF margin would therefore represent the amount of cash available to a firm before financing charges as a percentage of sales.






   The Bottom Line  

Unlevered free cash flow (UFCF) looks at a company's cash flow before considering its obligations. UFCF can be misleading to investors because it doesn't show much cash flow is left after paying down its debt. A company with a lot of debt would have a small amount of cash flow, which UFCF would not indicate. Investors should look at both levered and unlevered free cash flow to gain a better understanding of a company.
What Is Unlimited Liability?  

Unlimited liability refers to the full legal responsibility that business owners and partners assume for all business debts. This liability isn't capped and obligations can be paid through the seizure and sale of the owners’ personal assets without the protection that the popular limited liability business structure provides.





Key Takeaways

An unlimited liability company includes general partnerships and sole proprietors who are equally responsible for all debt and liabilities accrued by the business.Most companies opt to form limited partnerships in which a partner's liability can't exceed their investment in the company.Nondisclosure is a benefit of forming a foreign unlimited liability subsidiary for many companies. 


   Understanding Unlimited Liability  

Unlimited liability typically exists in general partnerships and sole proprietorships. It provides that each business owner is equally responsible for whatever debt accrued within a business if the company is unable to repay or defaults on its debt. An owner's personal wealth can be seized to cover the balance owed.






Most companies opt to form limited partnerships or limited liability companies instead where one or more business partners are only liable up to the amount of money they've invested in the company.


   An Example of Unlimited Liability  

Consider four individuals who are working as partners. Each invests $35,000 into the new business that they own jointly. The company accrues $225,000 in liabilities over one year. All four partners are equally liable for repayment of the $225,000 if the company can't repay and/or defaults on these debts. The owners would be required to come up with $56,250 each to alleviate the $225,000 in debt, in addition to their initial investment of $35,000.


   Unlimited Liability Laws Worldwide  

Unlimited liability companies are typically found in jurisdictions where company law stems from English law. Unlimited liability companies are incorporated or formed through registration under the Companies Act of 2006 in the United Kingdom.






Other areas where these companies are formed under English law include Australia, New Zealand, Ireland, India, and Pakistan.



Germany, France, the Czech Republic, and two jurisdictions in Canada are also areas where unlimited liability companies are commonly formed, but they're referred to as unlimited liability corporations in Canada.



Despite the number of companies and countries in which they exist, unlimited companies are an uncommon form of company incorporation due to the burden placed on owners to cover a company's debt, specifically when the company faces liquidation.



One of the benefits of forming an unlimited liability subsidiary may be nondisclosure. Etsy, an online crafts marketplace, created an Irish subsidiary in 2015 that's classified as an unlimited liability company. Public reports on money that the company moves through Ireland or tax payment amounts are therefore no longer required.


   Joint Stock vs. Unlimited Liability  

A joint-stock company (JSC) is similar to an unlimited liability company in the U.S. because shareholders have unlimited liability for company debts. JSCs operate under associations in New York and in Texas under the Texas Joint-Stock Company/Revocable Living Trust model, as well as in other states.



This model has some basic differences from a general partnership, including a lack of limited liability for shareholders, formation through a private contract that creates a separate entity, and the fact that one shareholder can't bind another shareholder regarding liability because each is equally responsible.




What Is a Sole Proprietorship?
A single individual has complete control over a sole proprietorship. All business assets are the proprietor's personal assets, and the individual is 100% responsible for business debts and liabilities. This business structure is most suited to low-risk enterprises.




What Is a Corporation?
A corporation is owned by its stockholders who are completely protected from the business's liabilities. Forming a corporation requires filing articles of incorporation with the state in which the business is located. A small business corporation (S-corporation) is similar but tax obligations pass through from the corporation to the owners who must report their share of the business's income and losses on their personal returns.




What Is a Disregarded Entity?
"Disregarded entity" is a tax term. Like an S-corporation, a limited liability business structure allows income and losses to pass down to its owners' personal tax returns. The business structure itself is "disregarded" by the IRS for tax purposes.


   The Bottom Line  

Each business owner is equally responsible for any and all debts that accrue within an unlimited liability business structure. Their personal assets are at risk if the business is unable to repay or defaults on its debt. This type of structure is typically suitable for small businesses with limited assets and debts.



Consult with a financial advisor or attorney in your state if you're considering forming and operating this type of business entity.
What Is an Unlimited Liability Corporation (ULC)?  

An unlimited liability corporation (ULC) is a corporate structure used in Canada that allows shareholders to be liable if the company declares bankruptcy. Sometimes ex-shareholders are also liable, depending on how recently they sold their stock. Despite this disadvantage, the structure of a ULC can be preferable in certain circumstances due to the tax benefits granted to shareholders of these companies.



An unincorporated joint-stock company (JSC) is the United States' equivalent to an unlimited liability corporation: JSC shareholders have unlimited liability for company debts.






If for some reason, it finds it more advantageous to do so, a ULC can elect to be treated as a corporation by checking the appropriate box on its tax return.


   Understanding Unlimited Liability Corporations (ULCs)  

Generally, the concept of unlimited liability involves general partners and sole proprietors who are equally responsible for debt and liabilities accrued by the business. As the word "unlimited" implies, this liability is not capped and can be paid off through the seizure of owners' personal assets (as opposed to limited liability structures, which cap responsibility to the amount a person actually invested in a company, thus shielding private wealth). Most corporations are limited liability structures; that's one of the points of incorporation.



An unlimited liability corporation is sort of a hybrid: It is an incorporated entity with unlimited liability. The ULC shelters shareholders from liability in most circumstances, with one major exception: upon liquidation of the company. If that happens, shareholders become liable for the debts of the company. Ex-shareholders can also be held responsible if they disposed of their shares less than one calendar year before the bankruptcy occurs.



Organizing as a ULC is only available for businesses operating in three Canadian provinces: Alberta, British Columbia, and Nova Scotia.





key takeaways

An unlimited liability corporation (ULC) is a corporate structure used in three Canadian provinces.The shareholders of unlimited liability corporations (ULCs) are responsible for debts and losses incurred by the company in case of bankruptcy; in return, they receive tax-advantaged treatment on their dividends and capital gains.Unlimited liability corporations (ULCs) are treated as corporations for Canadian tax purposes, but as flow-through entities for U.S. tax purposes.


   Advantages of an Unlimited Liability Corporation (ULC)  

The unlimited liability corporation has become a useful vehicle for U.S. investors who wish to acquire or put money into a Canadian business, or an American company looking to set up shop in Canada—due to the preferential tax treatment.



A ULC is treated as a regular Canadian corporation for tax purposes. As such, it’s subject to Canada's 25% withholding tax on the payment of shareholders dividends and interests (though the Canada Revenue Agency allows this to be alleviated by deeming the dividend a distribution of capital). However, the U.S. Internal Revenue Code states that the ULC is disregarded as a corporation for U.S. tax purposes, as profits and losses flow through to shareholders—it doesn't pay corporate tax, in other words.



So like U.S. partnerships and other flow-through entities, a ULC avoids the issue of double taxation, its primary advantage. Also, flowing through the company’s losses can help shareholders offset their income, thus reducing their taxes. American shareholders can in addition claim foreign tax credits on their tax returns, offsetting the Canadian withholding tax.



For businesses, another benefit of forming an unlimited liability subsidiary may be nondisclosure. Public reports on money the company moves through the ULC—or tax payment amounts—are not required.
What Is the Unlimited Marital Deduction?  

The unlimited marital deduction is a provision in the U.S. Federal Estate and Gift Tax Law that allows an individual to transfer an unrestricted amount of assets to their spouse at any time, including at the death of the transferor, free from tax. The unlimited marital deduction is an estate preservation tool because assets can be distributed to surviving spouses without incurring estate or gift tax liabilities.





Key Takeaways

The unlimited marital deduction allows spouses to transfer an unlimited amount of money to one another, including upon death, without penalty or tax.Gifts made to other non-spouse individuals or organizations are subject to IRS gifting limits and estate tax.Any asset transferred to a surviving spouse can be included in the spouse's taxable estate.The limit on non-taxable gifts under the rules is $16,000 per individual and the estate tax exemption is $12.06 million for 2022.The amounts increase to $17,000 and $12.92 million in 2023.


   Understanding the Unlimited Marital Deduction  

The unlimited marital deduction is an estate tax provision that went into effect in 1982. The provision eliminated both the federal estate and gift tax on property transfers between spouses, treating them as one economic unit. The deduction was adopted by Congress to redress the problem of estates being pushed into higher tax brackets by inflation. Because the estate tax, like the income tax, is progressive, estates that grow with inflation are hit with higher tax rates.



With the unlimited marital deduction, the amount of property that can be transferred between spouses is unlimited, meaning that a spouse can transfer all of their property to the other spouse during their lifetime or at death without incurring any federal estate or gift tax liabilities on this first transfer.



The transfer is made possible through an unlimited deduction from estate and gift tax that postpones the transfer's taxes on the property inherited from each other until the second spouse's death. In other words, the unlimited marital deduction allows married couples to delay the payment of estate taxes upon the first spouse's death. After the surviving spouse dies, all assets in the estate over the applicable exclusion amount will be included in the survivor's taxable estate.






The IRS exemption for estate and gifts is $12.06 million for the 2022 tax year and $12.92 million for 2023.


   Special Considerations  

Any asset transferred to a surviving spouse can be included in the spouse's taxable estate—unless it is spent or gifted during the surviving spouse's lifetime. Alternatively, if the surviving spouse remarries, the unlimited marital deduction may allow the assets to pass to the new spouse without applying estate and/or gift taxes. In some situations, fewer taxes will be paid by using additional estate planning methods such as exemptions or trusts.


   Qualified Domestic Trusts  

The unlimited marital deduction applies only to surviving spouses that are United States citizens. A qualified domestic trust (QDOT) may be obtained to provide unlimited marital deductions for non-qualified spouses. A bequest through a QDOT defers estate tax until the principal is distributed by the trustee, a U.S. citizen, or a corporation that also withholds the estate tax.



Income on the principal distributed to the surviving spouse is taxed as individual income. After the surviving spouse becomes a U.S. citizen, the principal remaining in a QDOT may be distributed without further tax.
What Is Unlimited Risk?  

Unlimited risk refers to a situation where there is potential for unlimited losses on a trade or in a particular investment.



In practice, unlimited risk would be practically realized as a total loss or bankruptcy. Moreover, positions that have unlimited risk can be hedged using other market instruments.





Key Takeaways

Unlimited risk has to do with trades or investments that can theoretically face unlimited losses.Selling naked calls is an example of unlimited risk.While risk can be unlimited, generally speaking the investor can mitigate much of the risks.


   Understanding Unlimited Risk  

Any time an asset's price can move indefinitely against a trader's position means they are facing unlimited risk. A short trade is an example of a strategy with unlimited risk. While unlimited risk trades theoretically have unlimited risk, the trader doesn't actually have to assume unlimited risk. They can take steps to limit actual losses, such as hedging or setting stop loss orders.



Unlimited risk is the opposite of limited risk. With unlimited risk, there is the potential to lose more than your initial investment, which is possible in short selling, in trading futures contracts, or when writing naked options.



Risk itself refers to the probability that an investment will have an actual return different from the return that the investor expected. Risk ranges from losing some of one's investment to potentially losing the entirety of the original investment. With unlimited risk, it is possible (but not necessarily likely) to lose many times the amount of the original investment.



Risk varies from investment to investment, and one form of assessing risk can be calculated by using the standard deviation of the historical returns or average returns of a specific investment, with a higher standard deviation indicating a higher degree of risk.



Though the process may be intimidating, investors make high-risk investments regularly and for various logical reasons. The main justification is that, in finance, theoretically, the greater the risk to an investor the greater the potential return. The higher potential return compensates for the additional risk taken on by the investor.


   Controlling Risk and Unlimited Risk  

Unlimited risk may make it sound like making certain trades or certain investments is not worthwhile. For instance, since short selling has theoretically unlimited risk, certain traders may avoid it. While risk is theoretically unlimited, it isn't actually unlimited unless a trader (and their broker) allow that to happen.



A trader could enter a short trade in a stock at $5 and decide that they will close the short trade if the price moves up to $5.50. In this case, their actual risk is $0.50 per share and is not unlimited. The price could gap above their stop loss price of $5.50, say to $6 or $7. This would certainly increase the loss, but the loss is still capped to $1 or $2 where the stop loss would trigger in these cases.



The same concept applies to futures contracts or writing naked options. When losing money, a trade can be closed. The price at which a trader closes the position determines their actual loss.



It is possible that the loss could be more than they initially invested in the trade, or even more than they have in their trading account. When this occurs, it is called a margin call and the broker will ask the trader to deposit funds in order for them to maintain their position (if still open) or bring their account balance up to zero. If the trading account drops below zero due to a trading loss, this means the trader has a debt to the broker.


   Example: Unlimited Risk When Writing Naked Options  

Assume that a trader is interested in writing naked calls on Apple Inc. (AAPL). The writer will receive the option premium, which is their maximum profit. If the price of AAPL is below the strike price at expiry, the option writer gets to keep the premium as their profit on the trade.



If the price of AAPL rises above the strike price, the option writer faces theoretically unlimited risk, since there is no cap on how high the price could rise. The writer has agreed to sell shares of AAPL at the strike price to the buyer of the call option. This means the option writer will need to buy shares of AAPL in order to sell them to the buyer at the strike price, regardless of the market price of AAPL at that time.



Assume one call option is written with a strike price of $250, which will expire in three months. The current price of AAPL stock is $240.50. The option is sold for $6.35, which means the writer receives $635 ($6.35 x 100 shares for one contract).



If the price of AAPL stock stays below $250, the writer keeps the $635 or a portion of it if they close the position early.



If AAPL rises above $250 then they face unlimited losses, but they can still control how much they lose, to an extent. For example, if AAPL rises to $255 before expiry, they may decide to cut their losses and exit their options trade.



If the price of AAPL is trading at $255 at expiry, the writer still hasn't lost money. This is because they can buy AAPL for $5 above the strike price ($255) in order to sell it at the strike price ($250). They lose $5 there, but made $6.35 on the option, so they still pocket $1.35 per share, less fees.



If the price of AAPL is trading at $270 at expiry, the naked option writer has lost money. They need to pay $20 more than the strike price ($270 – $250) in order to sell the shares at the strike price ($250). They lose $20 here, but made $6.35 on the option sale, so they end up losing $13.65 per contract. Their theoretical loss was unlimited, but the actual loss was $13.65 per contract. This could potentially be reduced through the use of stop losses, exiting early when losing, buying the shares for a covered call strategy, or hedging.
What is an Unlisted Security?  

An unlisted security is a financial instrument that is not traded on a formal exchange because it does not meet listing requirements. Trading of unlisted securities is done on the over-the-counter (OTC) market and they are often called OTC securities. Market makers, or dealers, facilitate the buying and selling of unlisted securities on the OTC market.





Key Takeaways

An unlisted security is a financial instrument that is not traded on a formal exchange because it does not meet listing requirements.Unlisted securities are also called OTC securities, as trading is done on the over-the-counter (OTC) market mostly by market makers.Unlisted stocks can be tracked via pink sheets or on the OTCBB.


   Understanding Unlisted Security  

Unlisted securities are usually issued by smaller or new firms that cannot or do not wish to comply with the requirements of an official exchange, such as market capitalization thresholds or listing fees. Furthermore, because they are not exchange traded, unlisted securities are often less liquid than listed securities. Unlisted stock can be tracked via pink sheets or on the Over-The-Counter Bulletin Board (OTCBB).



Securities must meet a number of requirements to be listed on an exchange. For example, to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), a publicly traded stock must represent a company that surpasses an annual income or market capitalization threshold. The company also must have issued a specific number of shares and be able to afford the exchange's listing fee.﻿﻿



These requirements ensure that only the highest quality companies trade on exchanges. Thus, unlisted securities may be of lower quality and present a greater risk to investors.


   Types of Unlisted Financial Instruments  

The most familiar type of unlisted security is common stock, often traded on the OTCBB or the pink sheets. This includes penny stocks, which trade for extremely low prices, while some are legitimate foreign companies that don't wish to file reports with the SEC.



There are also many unlisted non-stock instruments including corporate bonds, government securities, and certain derivative products such as swaps which are traded in the OTC market.


   Risks Investors Should Know  

The normal risks associated with investing are magnified with unlisted securities. Because size and other requirements for companies are reduced or eliminated, some unlisted companies may be undercapitalized, have highly risky business plans, and be no more than an idea without a plan for success.



Other unlisted transactions carry counterparty risk, liquidity concerns, and interconnection risks. This can include one side reneging on the contract. Also, since there is no formal exchange or clearing mechanism, it is up to the reputation of dealers and/or counterparties to fulfill all obligations of the transactions, including delivery of securities and payment of any monies required.
What Is an Unlimited Tax Bond?  

Unlimited tax bonds are municipal bonds guaranteed by the full faith and credit of a government that can levy taxes until the debt is repaid.



The repayment of an unlimited tax bond is based on the issuer's ability to levy taxes on its residents; a municipality may increase property taxes accordingly to cover its payments and obligations.





Key Takeaways

Unlimited tax bonds are municipal bonds guaranteed by the full faith and credit of a government that can levy taxes until the debt is repaid.Unlimited tax bonds may have higher credit ratings and offer lower yields than other comparable municipal bonds of the same maturity.Unlimited tax bonds can only be created when taxpayers vote to approve the bond issues, which is an indication of demand for the bonds.


   Understanding an Unlimited Tax Bond  

Unlimited tax bonds are a type of tax-supported bond, also called a general obligation (GO) bond.



GO bonds are a way for local governments to create streams of income for things such as roads, parks, equipment, and bridges. They are usually used to fund government projects that will serve the public community.



Revenue bonds are another type of GO bond. Revenue bonds are supported by revenue streams from projects such as toll bridges, highways, and local stadiums, or from essential services, such as water, sewer, and electricity providers.



The amount of taxation available by a particular GO bond may be specified as either limited or unlimited.


   Unlimited Tax Bond vs. Limited Tax Bond  

Backed by the full taxing power of the issuer, unlimited tax bonds can use property taxes, sales taxes, special taxes, and other sources of income to repay the bonds, as well as the interest owed to investors. These municipal bonds are secured by some limited taxing power of the issuer. For instance, an issue may be secured by a town’s property tax subject to a maximum rate at which the tax may be imposed. 



In theory, unlimited tax bond issuers can raise taxes at an unrestricted rate. In practice, however, it may be difficult to raise taxes beyond a certain point. One of the factors that credit analysts use to rate such bonds is the ability of the issuer to enforce penalties against and recover taxes from delinquent taxpayers. Given the government guarantee, unlimited tax bonds may have higher credit ratings and offer lower yields than other comparable municipal bonds of the same maturity.



Unlimited tax municipal bonds have historically had a lower risk than most other bond categories, primarily because unlimited tax bonds can only be created when taxpayers vote to approve the bond issues. This requirement clearly indicates the level of demand for the bonds. Voter approval also means the voters of a given population support the initiative, and there are usually more than adequate assets or taxing power built into the voting language to repay investors who provide the funds.



Whereas the issuers of unlimited tax bonds can theoretically raise taxes at an unrestricted rate, a limited tax bond asks the issuing local government to raise property taxes if necessary to meet existing debt service obligations. However, the amount of the increase is bound by a statutory limit.
What Are Unlisted Trading Privileges (UTP)?  

Unlisted trading privileges (UTP) refer to the processes around the trading of a security that is not required to meet certain minimum requirements to be traded on an exchange. Regulation for UTP is detailed in the Unlisted Trading Privileges Act of 1994.





Key Takeaways

Unlisted trading privileges (UTP) refer to the rules regarding trading securities that do not meet the requirements for listing on an exchange.In the U.S., regulation for unlisted trading is spelled out in the Unlisted Trading Privileges Act of 1994, an amendment to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.Unlisted shares include over-the-counter shares such as penny stocks or those of privately-held companies.With UTP, a company's stock can be traded on an exchange even though the company hasn't met the additional requirements of that particular exchange. 


   Understanding Unlisted Trading Privileges (UTP)  

UTP were developed in order to help increase the liquidity of securities across markets that do not include registered exchanges. UTP give certain companies the ability to trade on an exchange without meeting the additional requirements required for each national securities exchange in which they choose to list their security. The most common instance of unlisted trading occurs with over-the-counter (OTC) shares, also known as pink sheets, which may include penny stocks.



Historically, UTP were granted by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) through an application process. However, Congress in 1994 enacted the Unlisted Trading Privileges Act, which changed the procedures for UTP. The new provisions required the company offering a security issuance, and the exchange where the security is traded, to work jointly in gaining authorization for UTP from the SEC.


   Unlisted Trading Privileges Act of 1994  

The Unlisted Trading Privileges Act amended the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which serves as a primary governing legislation for the requirements for secondary market trading of securities in the United States.



The Unlisted Trading Privileges Act provisions are detailed in U.S. Code Title 15, Section 78(l)(f). This law allows any securities exchange to extend UTP to any company that meets the specified provisions detailed in the Act. The company must be fully compliant with the provisions preceding part (f) of the 1934 Securities Act, which discusses the standards required for national securities exchange listing.



The Unlisted Trading Privileges Act of 1994 was developed on principles that seek to cultivate fair and efficient market trading as well as protections for all parties involved. Therefore, all decisions surrounding UTP seek to consider and maintain certain principles.



Key provisions of the UTP Act include:



An exchange can offer UTP to a security that is listed on another national securities exchange in compliance with that exchange's requirements.The extension of UTP must be approved by the SEC, which can integrate certain additional requirements.The SEC has the right to revoke and reinstate UTP on an exchange.
What Is a Maturity Mismatch?  

Maturity mismatch is a term used to describe situations when there's a disconnect between a company's short-term assets and its short-term liabilities—specifically more of the latter than the former. Maturity mismatches can also occur when a hedging instrument and the underlying asset's maturities are misaligned.



A maturity mismatch may also be referred to as an asset-liability mismatch.





Key Takeaways

A maturity mismatch often refers to situations when a company's short-term liabilities exceed its short-term assets.Maturity mismatches are visible on a company's balance sheet and can shed light on its liquidity.Maturity mismatches often signify a company's inefficient use of its assets.Maturity mismatches can also occur when a hedging instrument and the underlying asset's maturities are misaligned.


   Understanding a Maturity Mismatch  

The term maturity mismatch commonly alludes to situations involving a company's balance sheet. A business cannot meet its financial obligations if its short-term liabilities outweigh its short-term assets and will likely run into problems, too, if its long-term assets are funded by short-term liabilities.



Maturity mismatches can shed light on a company's liquidity, as they show how it organizes the maturity of its assets and liabilities. They can also signify that the company is not using its assets efficiently, which could give rise to a squeeze in liquidity.



Mismatches can take place in hedging as well. This happens when the maturity of an underlying asset doesn't match the hedging instrument, thus creating an imperfect hedge. For example, a mismatch occurs when the underlying bond in a one-year bond future matures in three months.


   Preventing Maturity Mismatches  

Loan or liability maturity schedules must be monitored closely by a company's financial officers or treasurers. As much as it is prudent, they will attempt to match expected cash flows with future payment obligations for loans, leases, and pension liabilities.



A bank will not take on too much in short-term funding—liabilities to depositors—to fund long-term mortgage loans or bank assets. Similarly, an insurance company will not invest in too many short-term fixed income securities to meet future payouts, and a city or state treasurer's office will not invest in too many short-term securities to prepare for long-term pension payments.



In a broader sense, a non-financial company also carries maturity mismatch risk if, for example, it borrows a short-term loan for a project or capital expenditure (CapEx) that will not produce cash flows until a later year. An infrastructure contractor that takes out a loan with a five-year maturity will create maturity mismatch risk if the cash flows from the project begin in 10 years.


   Special Considerations  

Exact matching of maturities—such as cash flows from assets to meet liabilities as they come due—is sometimes not practical nor necessarily desirable. In the case of a bank that requires spread for profitability, borrowing short-term from depositors, and lending long-term at a higher interest rate generates a net interest margin for profits.






Financial companies can benefit from maturity mismatches when they borrow from short-term depositors and lend long-term at higher interest rates as this should lead to higher profit margins.


   Example of Maturity Mismatch  

Companies that borrow heavily must be mindful of their maturity schedules, as illustrated in the following example.



Faced with the near-term maturities of two senior secured second lien notes in 2018 and 2020, struggling home-builder K. Hovnanian Enterprises issued senior secured notes in 2017. These notes have maturities in 2022 and 2024 to pay off the notes with the shorter maturities.



This action was deemed necessary because the company recognized it would not generate sufficient cash to meet the 2018 and 2020 liabilities and had to resort to this to alleviate the issue arising from the initial maturity mismatch.
What Is an Unofficial Strike?  

An unofficial strike is a work stoppage by union members that is not endorsed by the union and that does not follow the legal requirements for striking. Workers engaging in unofficial strikes have little legal recourse if they are fired and do not receive strike pay. An unofficial strike is also called a wildcat strike or an unofficial industrial action.





Key Takeaways

An unofficial strike is a strike that is not sanctioned by a recognized union or approved under relevant labor relations law. Unofficial strikes are also known as wildcat strikes, due to their unapproved nature.Unofficial strikes can be especially risky; both for workers (who do not get the normal legal protections) and employers (who can face increased disruption to business). Throughout history, unofficial strikes have devolved from official strikes or evolved into official strikes. Many have met with success.


   Understanding an Unofficial Strike  

In the United States, an unofficial strike is illegal under the 1935 National Labor Relations Act (NLRA), and courts have held that employers are entitled to fire employees who engage in them.



However, U.S. workers are entitled to request that the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) terminate their relationship with their labor union if they feel that said union does not represent their interests. When workers do this, any strike action they may undertake afterward is technically unofficial but not illegal as terminating the relationship with the labor union removes the conflict between sections 7 and 9(a) of the NLRA.﻿﻿


   Causes of an Unofficial Strike  

Unofficial strikes occur when workers circumvent their own union and take action on their own initiative. This might occur because of incidents or conditions that arouse such immediate anger that the workers react before the normal channels of union action can swing into operation.



Alternatively, workers may take strike action in opposition to union leadership if they believe the union is failing to represent their interests or has been co-opted either by management or outside elements. Or, simply, if the union does not agree with the demand of the employees and refuses to support them in their actions to remedy what they perceive to be unjust wages or practices.



For businesses, unofficial strikes can be particularly disruptive because they often occur without warning; rather than as a somewhat expected step in a regulated process of labor-management relations managed under the NLRA and other existing laws. An unannounced strike can have immediate, serious consequences for the target business, related businesses, and customers, especially in the modern age of just-in-time (JIT) supply chains.



Due to their inherently extralegal nature and the sometimes volatile emotional factors involved, unofficial strikes may also entail an increased risk of violence and property destruction directed toward the business, managers, and non-striking workers. 


   Real-World Examples of Unofficial Strikes  

A notable unofficial strike was that of West Virginia teachers, who in 2018 refused to return to classrooms until their demands for higher wages and more generous healthcare benefits were met. This strike started out as an official strike, but since it failed to maintain the support of union leadership, later evolved into an unofficial strike. Despite being unofficial, the strike was successful and inspired other unofficial teachers’ strikes in Kentucky, Oklahoma, and Arizona.﻿﻿



Some other notable wildcat strikes started off as unofficial strikes but later gained the support of union leadership and became official. Examples include the Baltimore municipal strike of 1974, in which municipal workers initiated a strike action for better working conditions and higher wages, and the Memphis sanitation strike of 1968, in which black sanitation workers in the segregation-era city fought for better pay and safer working conditions. Due to the racial factors at play in the Memphis strike, it became a part of the Civil Rights movement, drawing the attention of black community leaders such as Martin Luther King, Jr.﻿﻿ ﻿﻿



On an international level, one of the most famous unofficial strikes occurred in France. In May 1968, unofficial strike actions spread across the entire nation, causing the French president, Charles de Gaulle, to flee the country briefly and bringing the economy and government to a halt. This was the first unofficial strike to affect an entire nation.﻿﻿
What Is an Unpaid Dividend?  

An unpaid dividend is a dividend that is due to be paid to shareholders but has not yet been distributed. Unpaid dividends exist because of timing differences between the record date–the time at which existing shareholders become eligible to receive the upcoming dividend–and the payment date–when the dividend is actually paid.





Key Takeaways

Unpaid dividends exist because there is a difference between the time when a company announces its dividend and the time when that dividend is paid.During this time, a company will record any unpaid dividends on its books, but this balance will be eliminated once the dividends are paid.It's important for investors to understand the key dates involved in the dividend-payment process so they are not confused about whether or not they will be entitled to a particular dividend payment.


   How Unpaid Dividends Work  

To understand unpaid dividends, it is helpful to review the four key dates that are part of the dividend-payment process. The first is the declaration date, which is also known as the “announcement date”. This is the date when the company’s board of directors announces the upcoming dividend. This date is followed by the ex-dividend date, the date when new buyers of the stock will not be eligible for the upcoming dividend payment.



The record date, also known as the “date of record”, is the next important date. In order to be entitled to the upcoming dividend, shareholders must be recorded on the company’s books by this date. Typically, the record date is two days after the ex-dividend date. Last, the payment date is the date when the dividend will be paid to shareholders of record. The record date generally occurs about one week after the ex-dividend date.



Between the declaration date and the payment date, a company will have unpaid dividends on its books. Once the payments are made, the unpaid dividends will be zeroed out accordingly.


   Example of an Unpaid Dividend  

XYZ Corporation is a publicly-traded company with a price of $30 per share. Many of its investors view XYZ as a stable income-producing investment because of its consistent track record of dividend payments. Eager to maintain this reputation, XYZ’s managers declare an upcoming dividend of $1.50 per share on July 30th. Its record date is set as Thursday, August 8th. The company's ex-dividend date is set for Tuesday, August 6th.



In this scenario, only shareholders who bought their shares on Monday, August 5th (or before that date) would be entitled to receive a dividend. The payable date can vary depending on the preferences of the company, but it is always the last of the four dates. For the period of time between the announcement date on July 30th and the payment date, XYZ will have unpaid dividends on their books. However, these will be eliminated once the dividends are paid to shareholders.
What Is an Unqualified Audit?  

An unqualified audit reflects business financial statements that are transparent and compliant with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). An unqualified opinion is given after thorough research considering all accompanying financial documents.



Any possible remaining discrepancies with the audit would stem from information that could not be obtained by the auditor. An unqualified report analyzes the internal systems of control as well as the details in the organization's books.



Additional names for unqualified audits often included unqualified opinions and unqualified reports.





Key Takeaways

An unqualified audit is a thorough audit of a firm's internal systems of control and its financial statements and all supporting documents.An unaudited opinion, in contrast, provides an opinion of a firm's financial statements but without in-depth research, often highlighting the auditor's reservations.An unqualified report reflects fair and transparent financial statements in compliance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and statutory requirements.


   Understanding Unqualified Audits  

The alternative to an unqualified audit is an unaudited opinion. Unqualified audits are performed with emphasis on details and accuracy and according to accepted accounting principles. If an auditor has reservations as to the accuracy or validity of a firm's financial statements, a qualified opinion may be given instead that outlines the auditor's reservations.






An unqualified report concludes that the financial statements of a company are fair and transparent based on thorough research.



In an unqualified report, auditors will conclude that the financial statements of a business present its affairs fairly in all material aspects. This opinion assumes that a business complied with GAAP and statutory requirements. An opinion of this sort is known as a clean report.



The unqualified report also reflects that any changes in accounting policies have been considered in the financial statements. This opinion does not offer a view on whether a business is in good economic health. The opinion rather states that a business's financial reporting is transparent and thorough and has not hidden important facts.






A qualified report does not comment on whether a business is in good economic health, only that a business's financial reporting is transparent and thorough.


   Unqualified Report vs. Qualified Report  

For an unqualified report, the auditor has concluded that most financial matters are dealt with correctly—although there may be some outstanding minor issues. In contrast, an auditor’s report is qualified for reasons such as limited scope in the auditor’s work or if there are issues concerning the accounting policies. The points of concern must be financially significant for an auditor to qualify a report.



For example, the auditor might consider that an issue misrepresents the actual financial position of the firm. In this case, the auditor might issue a disclaimer or adverse opinion.



However, a qualified audit report does not necessarily mean that a business is in distress or that a firm is failing to disclose important information in the financial statements. A qualified audit report only reflects the auditor’s inability to give a clean report.
What Is an Unqualified Opinion?  

An unqualified opinion is an independent auditor's judgment that a company's financial statements are fairly and appropriately presented, without any identified exceptions, and in compliance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).





Key Takeaways

An unqualified opinion means an independent auditor has judged a company's financial statements to be fair and appropriately represented.An unqualified opinion is the most common type issued by auditors.












Investopedia / Matthew Collins


   Understanding Unqualified Opinions  

An unqualified opinion is essentially a clean report. It indicates the auditor is satisfied with the company's financial reporting during an audit. It is the type of opinion most companies expect to receive from an independent auditor and reassures investors in the company that the financial information they have been given is presented in an accurate and fair manner.



An unqualified opinion is the most common type given in an auditor's report. Like any auditor’s opinion, it does not judge the actual financial position of the company or interpret financial data. It simply indicates that the independent auditor has seen enough information to conclude that the company's financial statements conform to GAAP and fairly present the company's financial position for the stated time frame. It is issued when the auditor believes that all changes, accounting policies, and their application and effects, have accurately been disclosed.


   Unqualified Opinion vs. Other Opinions  

An auditor can give four basic types of opinion:



Unqualified opinionQualified opinionAdverse opinionDisclaimer of opinion.



With a qualified opinion, the auditor has determined there is a material issue regarding accounting policies—but one that does not misrepresent the factual financial position. Auditors typically qualify reports with statements like "except for the following adjustments," when they have insufficient information to verify certain aspects of the transactions and reports being audited.



Qualified opinions may also be issued if the financial statements deviate from GAAP or have inadequate disclosure. The auditor might report an adverse opinion if they believe the financial statements do not accurately represent the company's financial position. They might also issue a disclaimer of opinion if they cannot issue an opinion on the financial statements because something has prevented them from gathering enough information.
What Is an Unquoted Public Company?  

An unquoted public company, also known as an unlisted public company, is a firm that has issued equity shares that are no longer traded on a stock exchange.





Key Takeaways

An unquoted public company or an unlisted public company is a firm that has issued equity shares that are no longer traded on a stock exchange.Companies might be unquoted because they are too small to qualify for a stock market listing, have too few shareholders for a listing, or have been delisted.Shares in unquoted public companies are bought and sold in over-the-counter markets.






OTC markets that trade unquoted public companies typically have less transparency than public exchanges.


   Understanding Unquoted Public Companies  

A public company is a company that has issued stock shares through an initial public offering (IPO) while its stock trades on a stock exchange or an over-the-counter market that is a market of private brokers and dealers. Publicly-quoted stocks might trade on exchanges like the New York Stock Exchange, which is the largest equities-based exchange in the world. However, unquoted public companies are unlisted and trade over-the-counter.


  Reasons for an Unquoted Public Company  

Companies might be unquoted because they are too small to qualify for a stock market listing. Major exchanges have listing requirements for stocks that include annual earnings thresholds, a minimum number of outstanding shares, and listing fees.



An unquoted company might have too few shareholders for a listing, or the company's management might want to avoid ownership disclosure requirements under certain listing exchanges. Another reason for remaining unquoted is simply cost savings. A struggling company may not want to incur the multimillion dollar expenses of listing.



Companies that have been delisted or removed from major exchanges might result in their stock becoming an unquoted public company. Delisting can be voluntary or can be due to a failure to meet the listing requirements of an exchange.



By remaining unquoted, the firm's owners can operate the business more like a private company and avoid some of the exchange regulations. However, although unquoted public companies are less heavily regulated than listed public companies, they are more regulated than private ones. As public companies, they still have to comply with financial reporting requirements and may be subject to the same takeover codes as listed companies. Unquoted public companies may also be banned from marketing themselves to investors.


  Trading and Valuation  

As unlisted securities, shares in unquoted public companies are bought and sold in over-the-counter markets (OTC). In an OTC market, broker-dealers quote stock prices at which they will buy and sell a stock. However, two investors (a buyer and seller) can execute a trade on an OTC market without other investors being aware of the price at which the transaction was completed. As a result, OTC markets that trade unquoted public companies typically have less transparency than public exchanges.



Also, stocks of unquoted public companies are rarely traded, or are illiquid, leading to difficulty in pricing the stock. Unquoted public companies are valued using various financial models, including the comparables approach. The comparables approach analyzes companies or divisions that are of similar makeup and industry.



By comparing market transactions such as investments or buyouts into similar companies, investors can get a sense of the value of the unquoted company. The approach also includes an analysis of the competition to estimate the equity share value of the unquoted company.


   Example of an Unquoted Public Company  

Let's say as an example that executives at Google have decided to remove the company's stock from listed exchanges and opt for becoming an unquoted public company. The company would be primarily owned by the founders and a few private investors.



As opposed to investors trading Google stock on an exchange, the unquoted Google would not be readily available to trade, and any transactions would need to be processed through the OTC market. As a result, investors wouldn't be able to buy and sell the stock quickly or easily.



Also, valuing the company's stock price would be a challenge since the financial information might not be available to potential investors and brokers. Any valuation would be done by analyzing proxy companies such as the competition in the social media sector. However, Google would have fewer regulatory requirements freeing up resources that were used to meet those requirements.
What Is an Unrealized Gain?  

The term unrealized gain refers to an increase in the value of an asset, such as a stock position or a commodity like gold, that has yet to be sold for cash. As such, an unrealized gain is one that takes place on paper, as it has yet to be realized. An unrealized gain becomes realized once the position is sold for a profit. It is possible for an unrealized gain to be erased if the asset's value drops below the price at which it was bought.

An unrealized gain is a theoretical profit that exists on paper, resulting from an investment that has not yet been sold for cash.Unrealized gains are recorded on financial statements differently depending on the type of security, whether they are held-for-trading, held-to-maturity, or available-for-sale.Gains do not affect taxes until the investment is sold and the gain is realized.If an investment is held for longer than a year, the profit is taxed at the capital gains tax rate.An unrealized loss is the opposite of an unrealized gain where an investment has decreased in value but has not yet been sold.

   How an Unrealized Gain Works  

An unrealized gain occurs when the current price of a security is higher than the price the investor initially paid for the security, including any fees associated with the purchase. Many investors calculate the current value of their investment portfolios based on unrealized values. In general, capital gains are taxed only when they are sold and become realized.



Investors may choose to sit on unrealized gains for tax benefits. Most assets held for more than one year are taxed at the long-term capital gains tax rate, which is either 0%, 15%, or 20% depending on one's income. Assets held for one year or less are taxed as ordinary income, with rates ranging from 10% to 37%.



In 2022, a single filer making $41,675 will pay 0% on realized long-term capital gains, and an individual making $459,750 will pay only 15%. That single filer pays 0% if they make $44,625 while the 15% rate is applied to a single filer earning $492,300 in 2023. If those same people held their investments for one year or less, their realized gains would be taxed at the 22% and 35% rates respectively.



An investor may also choose to wait to sell investments if gains realized late in the year would place them in a higher tax bracket and, thus, increase their tax burden. That investor may be better off waiting until January to sell, at which point they can incorporate that profit into their tax plan for the year.






When there are unrealized gains present, it usually means an investor believes the investment has room for higher future gains. Otherwise, they would sell now and recognize the current gain.


   Recording Unrealized Gains  

Unrealized gains are recorded differently depending on the type of security. Securities that are held to maturity are not recorded in financial statements, but the company may decide to include a disclosure about them in the footnotes of its financial statements.



Securities that are held for trading are recorded on the balance sheet at their fair value, and the unrealized gains and losses are recorded on the income statement.



The increase or decrease in the fair value of held-for-trading securities impacts the company's net income and its earnings per share (EPS). Securities that are available for sale are also recorded on a company's balance sheet as an asset at fair value. However, the unrealized gains and losses are recorded in comprehensive income on the balance sheet.






   Unrealized Gain vs. Unrealized Loss  

The opposite of an unrealized gain is an unrealized loss. This type of loss occurs when an investor holds onto a losing investment, such as a stock that has dropped in value since the position was opened. Similar to an unrealized gain, a loss becomes realized once the position is closed at a loss.



Unrealized gains and unrealized losses are often called "paper" profits or losses since the actual gain or loss is not determined until the position is closed. A position with an unrealized gain may eventually turn into a position with an unrealized loss as the market fluctuates and vice versa.


   Example of an Unrealized Gain  

If an investor purchased 100 shares of stock in ABC Company at $10 per share, and the fair value of the shares subsequently rises to $12 per share, the unrealized gain on the shares still in their possession would be $200 ($2 per share x 100 shares). If the investor eventually sells the shares when the trading price is $14, they will have a realized gain of $400 ($4 per share x 100 shares).
What Is an Unrealized Loss?  

An unrealized loss is a "paper" loss that results from holding an asset that has decreased in price, but not yet selling it and realizing the loss. An investor may prefer to let a loss go unrealized in the hope that the asset will eventually recover in price, thereby at least breaking even or posting a marginal profit. For tax purposes, a loss needs to be realized before it can be used to offset capital gains.



Unrealized gains and losses can be contrasted with realized gains and losses.





Key Takeaways

Unrealized losses result from assets that have decreased in value but which have not yet been sold.Unrealized losses turn into realized losses when an asset that has lost value is ultimately sold.Depending on the type of security, unrealized losses may or may not have an effect on a firm's accounting.For tax purposes, capital losses are only recognized if they are realized losses.


   Understanding Unrealized Losses  

An unrealized loss stems from a decline in value on a transaction that has not yet been completed. The entity or investor would not incur the loss unless they chose to close the deal or transaction while it is still in this state. For instance, while the shares in the above example remain unsold, the loss has not taken effect. It is only after the assets are transferred does that loss become substantiated. Waiting for the investment to recoup those declines could result in the unrealized loss being erased, or becoming a profit.



An unrealized loss can be calculated for a period of time. This may span from the date the assets were acquired to their most recent market value. An unrealized loss can also be calculated for specific periods to compare when the shares saw declines that brought their value below an earlier valuation.



The decision to sell an unprofitable asset, which turns an unrealized loss into a realized loss, may be a choice to prevent continued erosion of the shareholder’s overall portfolio. Such a choice might be made if there is no perceived possibility of the shares recovering. The sale of the assets is an attempt to recoup a portion of the initial investment since it may be unlikely that the stock will return to its earlier value. If a portfolio is more diversified, this may mitigate the impact if the unrealized gains from other assets exceed the accumulated unrealized losses.






The psychological impact of holding unrealized losses is often different than that of holding gains, as investors hope for a rebound in the underlying asset to recoup some or all of their paper losses, and may even take on additional risk in hopes of doing so. This is known as the disposition effect, an extension of the behavioral economics concept of loss aversion.


  Unrealized Losses vs. Unrealized Gains  

The complement of an unrealized loss is an unrealized gain. This type of increase occurs when an investor holds onto a winning investment, such as a stock that has risen in value since the position was opened. Similar to an unrealized loss, a gain only becomes realized once the position is closed for a profit.


   Unrealized Losses in Accounting  

While unrealized losses are theoretical, they may be subject to different types of treatment depending on the type of security. Securities that are held to maturity have no net effect on a firm's finances and are, therefore, not recorded in its financial statements. The firm may decide to include a footnote mentioning them in the statements. Trading securities, however, are recorded in a balance sheet or income statement at their fair value. This is primarily because their value can increase or decrease a firm's profits or losses. Thus, unrealized losses can have a direct impact on a firm's earnings per share. But their effect on a firm's cash flow is neutral. Securities that are available for sale are also recorded in a firm's financial statement at fair value as assets.


  Tax Consequences  

Calling unrealized losses "paper" losses implies that the loss is only "on paper." This is especially important from a tax perspective as, in general, capital gains are taxed only when they are realized, and you can only deduct capital losses on your tax return after they're realized too.



If you have both capital gains and losses in the same year, you can use your capital losses to reduce your tax burden by offsetting your capital gains. A capital loss can also be used to reduce the tax burden of future capital gains. Even if you don't have capital gains, you can use a capital loss to offset ordinary income up to the allowed amount.


   Example of an Unrealized Loss  

Assume, for example, that an investor purchased 1,000 shares of Widget Co. at $10, and it subsequently traded down to a low of $6. The investor would have an unrealized loss of $4,000 at this point. If the stock subsequently rallies to $8, at which point the investor sells it, the realized loss would be $2,000.



For tax purposes, the unrealized loss of $4,000 is of little immediate significance, since it is merely a "paper" or theoretical loss; what matters is the realized loss of $2,000.
What Is an Unrecaptured Section 1250 Gain?  

Unrecaptured section 1250 gain is an Internal Revenue Service (IRS) tax provision where previously recognized depreciation is recaptured into income when a gain is realized on the sale of depreciable real estate property. Unrecaptured section 1250 gains are taxed at a maximum 25% tax rate, or less in some cases. Unrecaptured section 1250 gains are calculated on a worksheet within Schedule D instructions, and they are reported on the Schedule D and carried through to the taxpayer's 1040.





Key Takeaways

An unrecaptured section 1250 gain is an income tax provision designed to recapture the portion of a gain related to previously used depreciation allowances.It is only applicable to the sale of depreciable real estate.Unrecaptured section 1250 gains are usually taxed at a 25% maximum rate.Section 1250 gains can be offset by 1231 capital losses.Section 1250 applies to real property, where Section 1245 applies to personal property.


   How Unrecaptured Section 1250 Gains Work  

Section 1231 assets include all depreciable capital assets held by a taxpayer for longer than one year. Section 1231 is the umbrella for assets belonging to section 1245 and section 1250, and the latter is what determines the tax rate of depreciation recapture. Section 1250 relates only to real property, such as buildings and land. Personal property, such as machinery and equipment, is subject to depreciation recapture as ordinary income under section 1245.



Unrecaptured section 1250 gains are only realized when there is a net Section 1231 gain. In essence, capital losses on all depreciable assets offset unrecaptured section 1250 gains on real estate. Therefore, a net capital loss overall reduces the unrecaptured section 1250 gain to zero.






Unrecaptured section 1250 gains can be offset by capital losses



A section 1250 gain is recaptured upon the sale of depreciated real estate, just as with any other asset; the only difference is the rate at which it is taxed. The justification for the gain is to offset the benefit of previously used depreciation allowances. While the gains attributed to accumulated depreciation are taxed at the section 1250 recapture tax rate, any remaining gains are only subject to the long-term capital gains rate of 15%.﻿﻿


   Example of Unrecaptured Section 1250 Gains  

If a property was initially purchased for $150,000, and the owner claims depreciation of $30,000, the adjusted cost basis for the property is considered to be $120,000. If the property is subsequently sold for $185,000, the owner has recognized an overall gain of $65,000 over the adjusted cost basis. Since the property has sold for more than the basis that had been adjusted for depreciation, the unrecaptured section 1250 gains are based on the difference between the adjusted cost basis and the original purchase price.



This makes the first $30,000 of the profit subject to the unrecaptured section 1250 gain, while the remaining $35,000 is taxed at the regular long-term capital gains. With that result, $30,000 would be subject to the higher capital gains tax rate of up to 25%. The remaining $35,000 would be taxed at the long-term capital gains rate of 15%.


   Special Considerations  

Since the unrecaptured section 1250 gains are considered a form of capital gains, they can be offset by capital losses. To do so, the capital losses must be reported through Form 8949 and Schedule D, and the value of the loss may vary depending on if it is determined to be short-term or long-term in nature. For a capital loss to offset a capital gain, they must both be determined to be short-term or long-term. A short-term loss cannot offset a long-term gain and vice versa.




What Are Examples of 1250 Property?
Examples of section 1250 property include commercial buildings or residential rental property. Commercial buildings would be treated as MACRS 39-year real property, while the residential rental property would be treated as 27.5-year property.




How Can You Avoid Paying Back Depreciation Recapture?
Investors can avoid paying tax on depreciation recapture by turning a residential property into a primary residence. In addition, the taxpayer could conduct a 1031 tax deferred exchange. Also, when an investor passes away, their heirs often receive the property as stepped-up basis.




How Much Tax Do I Pay on Unrecaptured Section 1250 Gain?
The maximum rate attributable to unrecaptured section 1250 gains is 25%.




How Do I Calculate Section 1250 Recapture?
Section 1250 is calculated as the lesser of two amounts. The first amount is the excess of accelerated depreciation claimed on real property over what would have been the allowable amount under a straight-line method. The second amount is the gain realized upon disposition.




What Triggers Depreciation Recapture?
Depreciation recapture occurs when there is a difference between the sale price of an asset and the tax basis or adjusted cost basis. The difference in these two amounts is recaptured by reporting the difference as ordinary income.


   The Bottom Line  

Section 1250 gain is a tax term that refers to the taxable gain from the sale of depreciable real property. The term comes from Section 1250 of the IRC which deals with the tax treatment of depreciation recapture. When a property owner sells a depreciable asset, the IRS requires the owner to recapture a portion of the depreciation claimed on the property over the years. The recaptured amount is taxed at a special rate known as the Section 1250 recapture rate, which is generally 25%.
What Is an Unrecorded Deed?  

An unrecorded deed refers to the situation where the title to a property, usually real estate, is not registered with the appropriate public records department.





Key Takeaways

An unrecorded deed refers to the situation where the title to a property, usually real estate, is not registered with the appropriate public records department.Unrecorded deeds can present many issues for sellers (or grantors) and buyers (or grantees), such as proof of ownership and tax implications.A buyer could encounter great difficulty in selling, insuring, or obtaining loans for a property if financial institutions and insurance companies cannot establish clear title.An unrecorded deed creates the potential for a seller to engage in a subsequent sale of the same property to yet another buyer.


   Understanding an Unrecorded Deed  

An unrecorded deed is a deed for real property that neither the buyer nor the seller has delivered to an appropriate government agency. Unrecorded deeds can present many issues for sellers (or grantors) and buyers (or grantees) such as proof of ownership and tax implications.



A deed transfers specific rights of ownership to a piece of real property between two parties. Most jurisdictions require that sellers file an original deed with a government agency that maintains such records in a given municipality. In the United States, this often takes place at the county level. This record serves to notify the public of the sale of property, which in turn provides assurance of current ownership to any entity involved in transactions affected by the property, such as the issuance of a mortgage or a home equity loan, where the property serves as collateral.



Failure to record a deed effectively makes it impossible for the public to know about the transfer of a property. That means the legal owner of the property appears to be someone other than the buyer, a situation that can have serious ramifications. A buyer, for example, could encounter great difficulty in selling, insuring, or obtaining loans for a property if financial institutions and insurance companies cannot establish clear title. Worse, an unrecorded deed creates potential for a seller to engage in a subsequent sale of the same property to yet another buyer.



Most mortgage companies require prospective home buyers to conduct a title search and secure title insurance on the property to be purchased. The title search examines existing public records to ensure a clean transfer of title, a process that could be disrupted by outstanding liens or past-due property taxes.






Self-financed purchasers would do well to consider doing a title search and securing title insurance for any property they want to buy.



Title insurance offers a further backstop by protecting the insurance holder from any losses due to deficiencies in the title not turned up by the title search. Buyers should note that lenders often require a separate title insurance policy that protects only the lender's interest in the property. Therefore, buyers may want to purchase a policy covering their interests as well.



Suppose, for example, that a homeowner self-funded the purchase of a home with an unrecorded deed and the seller neglected to close out an existing second mortgage. If the seller were to default on the loan, the bank would file a lien against the collateral, which would still appear to belong to the seller because of the unrecorded deed.
What Are Unregistered Shares?  

Unregistered shares, also known as restricted stock, are securities that are not registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). They are usually issued through private placements, Regulation D offerings, or employee stock benefit plans as compensation for professional services, or in exchange for funding a startup company.



For example, a privately-held company might issue unregistered shares to its executives and board members as part of their compensation package.





Key Takeaways

Unregistered shares are any form of company stock that does not have an effective registration statement on file with the SEC.Unregistered shares have fewer investor protections and pose higher risks so certain criteria—for example, being a high-income investor—are usually required in order to be sold these shares by a company.Investors can prevent being taken advantage of through unregistered securities scams by looking up if a particular security is registered in the SEC’s EDGAR database online.


   Understanding Unregistered Shares  

Unregistered shares have fewer investor protections and pose different kinds of risks than registered securities. As a result, companies can only sell unregistered shares to "qualified investors."



To be considered a "qualified investor," you must be a high-net-worth individual (HNWI) or a high-income investor. Who qualifies as an HNWI differs by the financial institution, but typically you must have liquid assets that range from six to seven figures. A high-income investor typically has an income of at least $200,000 per year or at least $300,000 per year for married couples.



In the past, soliciting or advertising unregistered shares was prohibited. However, in 2013 the SEC adopted Rule 506(c) as part of the Jumpstart Our Business Startups (JOBS) Act, allowing certain unregistered securities to be solicited and advertised.﻿﻿



Selling unregistered shares is typically considered a felony, but there are exceptions to this rule. SEC Rule 144 lays out the conditions under which unregistered shares may be sold:



They must be held for a prescribed period.There must be adequate public information about the security’s historical performance.The sale must be of less than 1% of shares outstanding and less than 1% of the previous four weeks’ average trading volume.All normal trading conditions that apply to any trade must be met.Sales of more than 5,000 shares or more than $50,000 worth of shares must be preregistered with the SEC. An exception to this condition occurs if the seller is not associated with the company that issued the unregistered shares (and has not been associated with it for at least three months) and has owned the shares for more than one year.


   Unregistered Stock Scams  

Sometimes investors can be taken advantage of through unregistered securities scams. These scams usually advertise the sales as private offerings with little to no risk plus high returns.



The SEC recommends that investors should be on the lookout for some of these common signs of potential fraud when considering investing in an unregistered offering:



Claims of high returns with little or no riskUnregistered investment professionalsAggressive sales tacticsProblems with sales documentsNo requirements on net worth or incomeOnly a salesperson seems to be involvedSham or virtual officesThe company is not in good standing or not listedUnsolicited investment offersSuspicious or unverifiable biographies of management or the promoters﻿﻿



Investors can also find out if a particular security is registered by looking it up in the SEC’s EDGAR database online. Stocks traded by the average investor will all be registered in the database.﻿﻿
What Is Unrelated Business Taxable Income (UBTI)?  

Unrelated business taxable income (UBTI) is income earned by a tax-exempt entity that's not related to the tax-exempt purpose of the entity.



More precisely, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) defines unrelated business taxable income for most organizations as "income from a trade or business, regularly carried on, that is not substantially related to the charitable, educational, or other purpose that is the basis of the organization's exemption."





Key Takeaways

Unrelated business taxable income (UBTI) is money earned by a tax-exempt entity that's not related to its tax-exempt purpose.UBTI prevents or limits tax-exempt entities from engaging in activities that are unrelated to their primary purposes.It was established in 1950 to ensure that tax-exempt businesses competed fairly with taxable companies in profit-generating activitiesMost forms of passive income, such as dividends, interest income, and capital gains from the sale or exchange of capital assets, are not treated as UBTI.Organizations with taxable unrelated business income pay corporate or trust tax rates.


   Understanding Unrelated Business Taxable Income (UBTI)  

The Internal Revenue Code (IRC) Section 501 grants tax-exempt status to a variety of tax-exempt and mutually beneficial organizations. However, a tax-exempt entity, such as a nonprofit or educational organization, may be liable for tax if it engages in, and derives income from, unrelated business activities.



UBTI was introduced in 1950 to ensure that tax-exempt businesses competed fairly with taxable companies in profit-generating activities. UBTI also prevents or limits tax-exempt entities from engaging in businesses that are unrelated to their primary purposes.



Most forms of passive income, such as dividends, interest income, and capital gains from the sale or exchange of capital assets, are not treated as UBTI. For example, if an investor holds an Individual Retirement Account (IRA) that invests in traditional equities, mutual funds, and ETFs, the UBTI rules will most likely not apply.



However, if an investment—for example, a mutual fund—generates income that qualifies as UBTI, the fund may be subject to taxation. For example, income from a restaurant business that flows into an IRA is considered taxable. That's because the business activity doesn't relate to the tax-exempt purpose of providing a pension to the IRA holder.


   Activities That Generate UBTI  

An activity is considered unrelated business (and the income generated taxable) if it meets the following thresholds, as defined by the IRS:



It is a trade or business that produces income from selling goods or performing services.It is regularly carried on in a way that's similar to the commercial activities of nonexempt organizations.It is not substantially related to furthering the exempt purpose of the organization. Activities that generate income must play a major role in achieving an organization's tax-exempt purpose to be substantially related.



IRS Publication 598 provides more information about unrelated business activities and these three categories.



Some transactions that may be considered unrelated business activity include:



Buying and selling a significant number of real estate properties in a year.
Conducting operations in businesses—such as restaurants, convenience stores, lodging inns, or gas stations—that generate active income and are operated through a pass-through entity such as a limited liability company (LLC) or master limited partnership (MLP).
Using margin for a stock purchase.
Making multiple private loans in a year.






Organizations must make estimated tax payments if they expect annual unrelated business income tax to be $500 or more. Estimated tax payments are normally due the 15th day of the 4th, 6th, 9th, and 12th months of the tax year and must total 100% of the organization’s total tax liability for that year.


  Excluded Activities  

The IRS excludes these activities from the definition of unrelated trade or business:



Volunteer Labor: When substantially all the work is performed for the exempt organization for no payment. For example, volunteer-run bake sales would be excluded. Business for Convenience of Members: When a 501(c)(3) organization or a state college or institution conducts business primarily for the convenience of its members, students, patients, officers, or employees. A school cafeteria would be excluded in this circumstance. Selling Donated Merchandise: When a business sells merchandise that the exempt organization received as gifts or contributions. For example, thrift shop operations of exempt organizations would normally be excluded Bingo: Certain bingo games are not considered to be unrelated trade or business.


   Taxes on UBTI  

Any exempt organization subject to the tax on unrelated business income is taxable at corporate rates (a federal rate of 21%) on gross income beyond $1,000. The same applies to exempt trusts except that income is taxed at trust rates (federal rates from 10% to 37%).



According to the IRS, the tax computed on the total UBTI can be reduced by any applicable tax credits, including general business credits (such as the investment credit) and the foreign tax credit. However, an exempt trust may not claim the deduction for a personal exemption that a trust normally can claim.



To pay the tax, exempt organizations must file IRS Form 990-T.


  Excluded Income  

Certain income is excluded from the unrelated business taxable income that an exempt organization may have to pay taxes on:



DividendsInterestCertain other investment incomeRoyaltiesCertain rental incomeCertain income from research activitiesGains or losses from the disposition of property



IRS Publication 598 provides more information about income that's excluded from UBTI.




Do I Have to Pay Taxes on UBTI?
If your tax exempt organization earns unrelated business income over $1,000 that doesn't fall into the IRS's excluded categories, then, yes, you do have to pay taxes on that income.




What Is Excluded From Unrelated Business Taxable Income?
Income that's excluded includes dividends, interest, capital gains, royalties, and certain other investment income. For a complete list, please see IRS Publication 598.




What Happens If UBTI Tax Isn't Paid?
An exempt organization may be subject to interest and penalty charges if it fails to pay a tax when the tax is due, it underpays its tax liability, doesn't file a return, or files a late return.


   The Bottom Line  

Unrelated business taxable income (UBTI) is income earned by a tax-exempt entity that isn't related to the tax-exempt purpose of the entity.



An income-earning activity is considered to be unrelated if it involves a trade or business, is carried on regularly, and is not substantially related to helping the organization carry out its mission.



With some exceptions, organizations will owe federal and state corporate or trust taxes on annual gross unrelated business income over $1,000.
What Is Unrestricted Cash?  

Unrestricted cash refers to cash that is readily available to be spent for any purpose and has not been pledged as collateral for a debt obligation or other purpose.



Often, to satisfy debt covenants, companies must maintain a certain level of cash on their balance sheets in case the company defaults or goes into nonpayment of their credit obligations.



The remaining cash that exceeds the covenant requirements is referred to as unrestricted cash. Unrestricted cash is a part of an organization's liquid funds, meaning it's easily accessible. Unrestricted cash is important since it shows how much cash a company has to meet its short-term bills and credit obligations.





Key Takeaways

Unrestricted cash is cash that's readily available to be spent for any purpose and has not been pledged as collateral for a debt obligation or other purpose.Sometimes, cash might be restricted if the money is required to be held aside to secure a bank loan or credit facility.Unrestricted cash is listed as a current asset on the balance sheet since it can be used to satisfy its short-term obligations or current liabilities. 


   Understanding Unrestricted Cash  

Unrestricted cash is listed on a company's balance sheet. However, it is typically listed as cash and cash equivalents. Unrestricted cash or cash and cash equivalents represent the money that an organization can spend today, meaning the money is readily available—or liquid. Unrestricted cash is considered a current asset on the balance sheet since it can be readily accessed and spent in the short term.



Liquidity is critical to companies since having enough cash available can help a company meet its short-term debt obligations and pay its vendors and suppliers. These short-term debt obligations and bills that are due within 90 days are called current liabilities. Unrestricted cash helps companies ensure that they have enough current assets to cover their current liabilities, called working capital.



Cash and cash equivalents include the following liquid assets:



Currency notes, coins, and all cash being held in a bank account, such as a demand deposit account or a savings account
Cash equivalents are short-term investments that can easily be converted into cash. For example, a certificate of deposit might be considered a cash equivalent.
Some marketable securities, such as U.S. Treasury bills, might be considered cash equivalents if they can be easily liquidated and have a maturity date of 90 days or less.



When companies report their financial statements, unrestricted cash must be listed in the cash and cash equivalents line item of a company's balance sheet.


   Unrestricted Cash vs. Restricted Cash  

Restricted cash is cash held by a company that is not readily available to be spent or used by the company. Cash might be restricted if the money is required to be held aside to secure a bank loan or credit facility.



Sometimes financial institutions impose credit covenants, which include requirements and restrictions. The cash pledged as collateral for a loan helps protect the bank in the event the company goes bankrupt or defaults on the loan.



Restricted cash is typically listed as a separate line item on the balance sheet. The description or details explaining why the cash is restricted is usually found in the notes section of a company's financial statements.



If the restricted cash is for a short-term pledge, meaning it's due to expire in less than one year, the line item would be located under current assets. However, if the restricted cash must be held for more than one year, it would be listed under long-term assets—called noncurrent assets. Conversely, unrestricted cash is listed as a current asset and can be used for any purpose since it has not been pledged to secure an obligation.


   Example of Unrestricted Cash  

For example, XYZ Corporation manufactures machinery and borrowed $1 million from the local bank. The bank required a debt covenant in which XYZ must hold $400,000 in cash on hand at all times.



Below is a portion of the balance sheet for XYZ corporation.



The $400,000 in cash specified by the debt covenant is listed as restricted cash.Cash & cash equivalents total $650,000, which is unrestricted and can be used for any purpose.



Despite $400,000 being held as restricted cash, XYZ has more than enough unrestricted cash to cover the $300,000 in accounts payable (money owed to suppliers) and $100,000 in short-term debt obligations.

What Are Unrestricted Net Assets?  

Unrestricted net assets are donations to nonprofit organizations that have no strings attached. That is, the assets may be used by the organization for general expenses or any legitimate expenditure.





Key Takeaways

Unrestricted net assets are donations to nonprofit organizations that can be used for general expenses or any other legitimate purpose of the nonprofit.Temporarily restricted net assets are usually earmarked by the donor for a specific program or project and must be used within a set time period.Permanently restricted net assets are often sums of money to be invested in perpetuity, with the proceeds available for a specified purpose.



Most donations are unrestricted net assets. However, a donor may choose to classify the donation as temporarily restricted net assets or even permanently restricted net assets, thus establishing rules for the use of the donation.


   Understanding Unrestricted Net Assets  

Organizations typically prefer donations of unrestricted net assets because they allow them maximum flexibility to spend as they see fit, whether for hiring additional personnel or expanding their services.



A restricted net asset may even be a burden to the organization that receives it. For example, an organization devoted to animal rescue may receive a restricted donation to be spent on the care and feeding of crocodiles. If the organization has no facilities or skilled staff devoted to crocodiles, it may be forced to spend more than the amount donated in order to fulfill the terms of the bequest.






Watchdog groups like Charity Navigator and Give.org help donors pick a worthy cause for their assets, restricted or not.



Nonetheless, the ability to restrict a gift to a nonprofit organization can be a powerful incentive. Another animal-lover may want to be certain that a gift will be used only to rescue cats from kill shelters, and never for mundane administrative purposes.


  Temporary or Permanent Gifts  

Temporarily restricted assets usually are donated for a particular purpose and must be used by a particular date, such as within one year. An example might be a donation to the Red Cross for emergency aid delivered to Puerto Rico after a hurricane.



Permanently restricted assets often come in the form of a fund that must be maintained indefinitely, with the income generated by its investment to be used for a particular purpose. Scholarship funds are often created as permanently restricted assets.



In addition, donations to museums of art, artifacts, and other valuables often come with restrictions, which can include a prohibition on the sale of the donated assets.


  Reporting Unrestricted Net Assets  

Nonprofit organizations in the U.S. produce a Statement of Financial Position which is equivalent to the balance sheet maintained by a business. Unrestricted net assets, temporarily restricted net assets, and permanently restricted net assets all are listed on this statement.



IRS Form 990 is a template for the creation of the Statement of Financial Position as well as a separate Statement of Activities, which is similar to an income statement.


  Monitoring Nonprofit Performance  

A legitimate and well-run nonprofit organization will provide Form 990s, annual reports, and auditor's reports to prospective donors for their review.



Those documents are also viewed by watchdog groups, which provide ratings and reviews of charitable organizations and cast a harsh light on nonprofits that spend disproportionately on staff salaries or marketing activities rather than on its stated goals. Among the watchdog groups are:



Charity Navigator uses a numbers-based rating system in its reviews of more than 9,000 nonprofit groups.
Give.org, run by the Better Business Bureau, accredits charities that meet its standards
CharityWatch rates charities on a scale of A through F and includes financial information on charities.
What Is an Unsatisfied Judgment Fund?  

An unsatisfied judgment fund is the amount of money set aside by certain states to cover uncompensated expenses related to bodily injuries sustained in motor vehicle accidents where the responsible driver is unable to pay for the damages. The unsatisfied judgment fund is used to help the injured and not-at-fault driver pay for medical bills related to the accident.



In order to be eligible to receive assistance from the fund, the injured party must be able to prove that they were not at fault and that they are unable to collect money from the responsible party. Usually, in order to get an unsatisfied judgment against another driver, the injured party must file supporting paperwork with the DMV. The requirements for this paperwork vary from state to state.





Key Takeaways

An unsatisfied judgment fund is the amount of money set aside by certain states to cover uncompensated expenses related to bodily injuries sustained in motor vehicle accidents where the responsible driver is unable to pay for the damages.The unsatisfied judgment fund is intended to protect drivers from financial losses resulting from motor vehicle accidents for which they are not responsible.In most states that have unsatisfied judgment funds, a motorist can discharge the debt either by paying it off in full or by filing bankruptcy. 


   Unsatisfied Judgment Funds Explained  

The unsatisfied judgment fund is intended to protect drivers from financial losses resulting from motor vehicle accidents for which they are not responsible. The responsible party may be unable to pay due to being insolvent, underinsured, or uninsured. Often, these state funds are financed by a small addition to the state's automobile registration fee. The fund pays unsatisfied judgments up to certain, fixed limits.



There can be steep penalties for a driver who is determined to be at fault in an accident and who is unable to pay for damages. For example, the driver might lose their driver's license until they are able to cover the financial damages. Once the responsible driver pays back the money into the unsatisfied judgment fund, they may be eligible for a driver's license again.


   Penalties for Unsatisfied Judgments  

The penalties for having an unsatisfied judgment can vary from state to state, but they usually include losing your license and your ability to register a vehicle until the debt is paid. In most states that have unsatisfied judgment funds, a motorist can discharge the debt either by paying it off in full or by filing bankruptcy.



In some states, a motorist can discharge the debt entirely via bankruptcy, while in others, they are still required to pay the debt, but can be given a payment plan. Once the motorist can show the DMV that their debt has been paid or discharged, or that they are making payments according to a court-approved payment plan, driving and vehicle registration privileges can typically be reinstated.



If the motorist at fault pays back the unsatisfied judgment amount, the injured motorist must file paperwork with the court to show that they have received the money that was owed. Once this paperwork is filed, the motorist at fault can take it to the DMV as proof that the debt is paid, and use it to have their license reinstated.



The costs of an unsatisfied judgment can be steep and can cause an uninsured or underinsured motorist to lose driving privileges for years if they cannot pay back the debt or declare bankruptcy. This is why motorists are required, in most states, to carry collision insurance, and why it’s a good idea to make sure you have enough coverage.
What Is an Unscheduled Property Floater?  

The importance of having adequate property insurance coverage can’t be overstated. One way to make sure you have the coverage you need is with an unscheduled property floater, an addition to an existing property insurance policy that provides coverage for personal property items that have not been individually itemized or valued.



An unscheduled personal property floater, also called a “blanket” floater, usually provides coverage against damage, theft, or loss of these items. The additional cost is generally much lower than the original policy premium. An unscheduled property floater is the opposite of a scheduled property floater, which itemizes all the different properties covered in the policy and their specific value.





Key Takeaways

An unscheduled property floater is a rider to an insurance policy that covers a blanket group of items—ones that have not been individually valued and listed.There is usually a set coverage limit and a set deductible for the property under the unscheduled floater.The cost of the floater is generally much less than the original insurance policy premium, but it does make your overall premium payment bigger.An unscheduled property floater is the opposite of a scheduled property floater that lists all of the different properties and their value.Items that might fall under an unscheduled property floater for homeowners insurance include clothes, jewelry, high-end electronics, and sports equipment.


   Understanding an Unscheduled Property Floater  

Unscheduled personal property refers to items that are covered in the main policy but not specifically itemized or valued. These items usually do not warrant separate insurance as their individual value is too low to warrant a separate policy.



Under homeowners insurance, for example, unscheduled property could include clothes, jewelry, sports equipment, and cameras. In the event of a fire or other catastrophic loss that the policy covers, the policyholder would add up all of these unscheduled items, estimate their total value, and submit them for compensation. Depending on the policy, even if these items were damaged, lost, or stolen outside of the home, for example on vacation, they would still be covered.



“Floater” refers to an addition to a current policy to make sure the insurance covers certain valuables. People buy these add-on policies to provide coverage for property that insurance may not adequately cover otherwise, and they sometimes come with additional benefits. For example, adding theft coverage even if the item was not in the home when it was stolen. Adding a floater usually requires a higher insurance premium.﻿﻿


   Unscheduled Property Floater vs. Scheduled Property Floater  

Note that floater policies also can be scheduled, as opposed to unscheduled. For scheduled policies, each item would be individually listed with an approximate value. Unscheduled jewelry coverage, for example, might not be enough to adequately compensate for the loss of some particularly expensive pieces, which would call for their own scheduled jewelry floater.﻿﻿



In this manner, a policyholder can adequately cover personal property that might be greater than the set coverage limit stipulated in the unscheduled property floater contract.






Payment for an item under an unscheduled property floater is usually the replacement cost of the property in question or the cash value of it after the deductible has been paid.



Unscheduled property floaters may be advantageous when the prospective policyholders have many items to insure, each valued at approximately $1,000 or less. An unscheduled policy usually has a set deductible and may also have a set coverage ceiling for all types of items.



Conversely, a scheduled property floater may be more appropriate if there are fewer but pricier items to insure, and it’s not a burden to list them all in the policy separately.﻿﻿



In general, unscheduled floaters may be limited to specific types of losses, such as theft or fire. Unscheduled floaters typically have one overarching amount of coverage that applies to any and all items within the scope of the policy. Scheduled floaters may cover more types of losses, but they will not cover items that the buyer doesn’t specifically spell out.﻿﻿



Notably, it also is possible to have both scheduled and unscheduled policy floaters in the same policy. In fact, certain types of policies may require one or more scheduled items in order for the policyholder to have unscheduled coverage.﻿﻿
What Is Unsecured?  

Unsecured refers to a debt or obligation that is not backed by any sort of collateral.



Collateral is property or other valuable assets which a borrower offers as a way to secure the loan, which is found in secured debt. In an unsecured loan, the lender will loan funds based on other borrower qualifying factors. These qualifying factors include credit history, income, work status, and other existing debts.





Key Takeaways

Unsecured is when a debt is not backed (secured) by collateral, making them relatively riskier than secured debts.In the event of default, these obligations must be repaid in other ways than seizing collateral.Because they are riskier, unsecured loans will carry higher interest rates than secured loans.Many personal loans, lines of credit, credit cards, and some business loans or bonds are unsecured.


   Understanding Unsecured  

Unsecured loans present a high risk to lenders. Because there is no collateral to take as recourse if the borrower defaults on the loan, the lender has nothing of value to claim against, and cover their costs. Default happens when the debtor is unable to meet their legal obligations to pay a debt. Instead, of demanding the collateral, the lender will need to turn to civil actions. Such actions include hiring a collection agency and filing a lawsuit to recoup unpaid balances. 



Unsecured loans and lines of credit (LOC) often have high-interest rates. These rates help to insulate lenders against the risks of loss. The most common forms of unsecured funds are credit cards and personal loans.






Unsecured loans or lines of credit (LOC) are loans where lending happens without the backing of equal value collateral.


   Unsecured vs. Secured Loans  

Many people are already familiar with secured loans in the form of mortgages and auto loans. In both of those cases, seizing the collateral which secures the loan can happen in the event of a default. For mortgages, this occurrence is called a foreclosure. Once a borrower has missed a payment the default process has begun. The servicer will complete the legal requirements on their end to reclaim the property which secured the mortgage.



In the case of auto, boat, or other large equipment loans, this process is repossession. In both foreclosure and repossession, the borrower will lose the item which secures the loan.



Secured loans or debt have limits set by the value of the collateral offered. When it comes to a home mortgage, a borrower may only receive a portion of the total fair market value of the property. Auto, boats, and other loans also follow this pattern.


   Example: Problems With Foreclosures  

With the 2006 housing market crash, foreclosed properties flooded the market. This massive influx of homes drove the value of all houses downward. Before the crash, home values increased exponentially, making a bubble. When the housing market bubble burst, the problem was two-fold. 



First, the surplus of houses led to lower overall home values. Because, like all products, more demand commands increased prices, while more supply than demand forces prices down. This drop in value caused the second shoe to drop. Homeowners seeing the worth of their investment fall hoped to sell. Due to the amount of ready supply, they often found this difficult, if not impossible to do. They, in turn, begin to default on their mortgages.



The banks reclaimed these properties and then found that they could not sell them either. Some of those banks went under as a result, which provided an example of how even secured loans can be risky business. Lending terms have changed dramatically since the 2006 housing crash, and banks are now more conservative as a result.
What Is an Unsecured Creditor?  

An unsecured creditor is an individual or institution that lends money without obtaining specified assets as collateral. This poses a higher risk to the creditor because it will have nothing to fall back on should the borrower default on the loan. If a borrower fails to make a payment on a debt that is unsecured, the creditor cannot take any of the borrower's assets without winning a lawsuit first.



A debenture holder is an unsecured creditor.






Unsecured credit is viewed as a higher risk.


   How an Unsecured Creditor Works  

It's uncommon for individuals to be able to borrow money without collateral. For example, when you take out a mortgage, a bank will always hold your house as collateral for the loan in case you default. If you take out a loan on an automobile, the lender will secure their debt with your car until it's fully paid off.



One exception wherein money is borrowed without collateral is large corporations, which often issue unsecured commercial paper.


   Differences Between Secured and Unsecured Creditors  

Secured creditors may repossess assets as payment for a debt using the borrower's collateral. Since the borrower has more to lose by defaulting on a secured loan, and the lender has an asset to gain, this type of debt carries less risk for the lender. As a result, secured debt generally comes with lower interest rates when compared to unsecured debt.



Meanwhile, repayment to unsecured creditors is generally dependent on bankruptcy proceedings or successful litigation. An unsecured creditor must first file a legal complaint in court and obtain a judgment before proceeding with collection through wage garnishment and other types of liquidated borrower-owned assets.



Often, a creditor will first attempt to obtain payment through direct contact and report the outstanding debt to the major credit bureaus—Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion—before seeking to bring the matter to court. The creditor may also choose to sell the unpaid debt to a collection agency.





Key Takeaways

Secured creditors often require collateral in the event the borrower defaults.Usually, bankruptcy is the only option for unsecured creditors if the borrower defaults.Unsecured creditors can range from credit card companies to doctor's offices.


   Types of Unsecured Creditors  

Due to the high risk to the lender, unsecured debt often comes with higher interest rates, placing a higher financial burden on the borrower.



Some of the most common types of unsecured creditors include credit card companies, utilities, landlords, hospitals and doctor's offices, and lenders that issue personal or student loans (though education loans carry a special exception that prevents them from being discharged).



Defaulting on unsecured debt can negatively affect the borrower's creditworthiness, making it much less likely that an unsecured creditor will extend them credit in the future.
What Is Unsecured Debt?  

Unsecured debt refers to loans that are not backed by collateral. If the borrower defaults on the loan, the lender may not be able to recover their investment because the borrower is not required to pledge any specific assets as security for the loan.



Because unsecured loans are considered riskier for the lender, they generally carry higher interest rates than collateralized loans.





Key Takeaways

Unsecured debts are loans that are not collateralized.They generally require higher interest rates, because they offer the lender limited protection against default.Lenders can mitigate this risk by reporting defaults to credit rating agencies, contracting with credit collection agencies, and selling their loans on the secondary market.


   Understanding Unsecured Debt  

A loan is unsecured if it is not backed by any underlying assets. Examples of unsecured debt include credit cards, medical bills, utility bills, and other instances in which credit was given without any collateral requirement.



Unsecured loans are particularly risky for lenders because the borrower might choose to default on the loan through bankruptcy. In this situation, the lender can seek to sue the borrower for repayment of the loan. However, if no specific assets were pledged as collateral, the lender may be unable to recover their initial investment.






Because unsecured loans are considered more risky for the lender, they generally carry higher interest rates than collateralized loans.



Although bankruptcy can allow borrowers to avoid repaying their debts, it is not without its consequences. Borrowers who have declared bankruptcy in the past may find it difficult or impossible to secure new loans in the future, since the bankruptcy will have a severe negative impact on their credit score, likely for many years to come.



Lenders, meanwhile, may seek alternative methods for recovering their investment. In addition to suing the borrower, lenders can also report any instances of default or delinquency to a credit rating agency. Alternatively, the lender can also hire a credit collection agency that will then seek to collect the unpaid debt.


   Real-World Example of Unsecured Debt  

Max is a private lender specializing in unsecured loans. He is approached by a new borrower, Elysse, who wishes to borrow $20,000.



Because the loan is unsecured, Elysse is not required to pledge any specific assets as collateral in case she defaults on the loan. As compensation for this risk, Max charges her an interest rate that is higher than rates associated with collateralized loans.



Six months later, the loan becomes delinquent due to a series of late and missed payments by Elysse. Max has several options to consider:



Although Max could seek to sue Elysse for repayment of the loan, he suspects this would not be worthwhile because there are no specific assets pledged as collateral. As an alternative, he chooses to hire a collection agency to pursue repayment of the loan on his behalf. As compensation for this service, Max agrees to pay the collection agency a percentage of any amount that the collection agency succeeds in recovering. Collection agencies charge on a contingency fee basis. Collection rates vary by collection type, size, and age. They average between 7.5% and 50% for each account, with consumer rates typically around 35%.



Another option: Max could have sold the debt to another investor using the secondary market. In that scenario, he would have likely sold the debt at a considerable discount to its face value. In exchange for the discounted purchase price, the new investor would assume the risk of not being repaid.
What Is an Unsecured Loan?  

An unsecured loan is a loan that doesn’t require any type of collateral. Instead of relying on a borrower’s assets as security, lenders approve unsecured loans based on a borrower’s creditworthiness.



Examples of unsecured loans include personal loans, student loans, and credit cards.





Key Takeaways

An unsecured loan is supported only by the borrower’s creditworthiness, rather than by any collateral, such as property or other assets.Unsecured loans are riskier than secured loans for lenders, so they require higher credit scores for approval.Credit cards, student loans, and personal loans are examples of unsecured loans.If a borrower defaults on an unsecured loan, the lender may commission a collection agency to collect the debt or take the borrower to court.Lenders can decide whether or not to approve an unsecured loan based on a borrower’s creditworthiness, but laws protect borrowers from discriminatory lending practices.


   How an Unsecured Loan Works  

Unsecured loans—sometimes referred to as signature loans or personal loans—are approved without the use of property or other assets as collateral. The terms of these loans, including approval and receipt, are most often contingent on a borrower’s credit score. Typically, borrowers must have high credit scores to be approved for unsecured loans.



An unsecured loan stands in contrast to a secured loan, in which a borrower pledges some type of asset as collateral for the loan. The pledged assets increase the lender’s “security” for providing the loan. Examples of secured loans include mortgages and car loans.



Because unsecured loans require higher credit scores than secured loans, in some instances, lenders will allow loan applicants with insufficient credit to provide a co-signer. A co-signer takes on the legal obligation to fulfill a debt if the borrower defaults. This occurs when a borrower fails to repay the interest and principal payments of a loan or debt.






Because unsecured loans are not backed by collateral, they are riskier for lenders. As a result, these loans typically come with higher interest rates.



If a borrower defaults on a secured loan, the lender can repossess the collateral to recoup the losses. In contrast, if a borrower defaults on an unsecured loan, the lender cannot claim any property. But the lender can take other actions, such as commissioning a collection agency to collect the debt or taking the borrower to court. If the court rules in the lender’s favor, the borrower’s wages may be garnished.



Also, a lien can be placed on the borrower’s home (if they own one), or the borrower may be otherwise ordered to pay the debt. Defaults can have consequences for borrowers, such as lower credit scores.


   Types of Unsecured Loans  

Unsecured loans include personal loans, student loans, and most credit cards—all of which can be revolving or term loans.



A revolving loan is a loan that has a credit limit that can be spent, repaid, and spent again. Examples of revolving unsecured loans include credit cards and personal lines of credit.



A term loan, in contrast, is a loan that the borrower repays in equal installments until the loan is paid off at the end of its term. While these types of loans are often affiliated with secured loans, there are also unsecured term loans. A consolidation loan to pay off credit card debt or a signature loan from a bank would also be considered unsecured term loans.



In recent years, the unsecured loan market has experienced growth, powered partly by financial technology (fintech) firms. The past decade, for example, has seen the rise of peer-to-peer (P2P) lending via online and mobile lenders.





$1.195 Trillion

The amount of U.S. consumer revolving debt as of February 2023, according to the Federal Reserve.



If you’re looking to take out an unsecured loan to pay for personal expenses, a personal loan calculator is an excellent tool for determining what the monthly payment and total interest should be for the amount you’re hoping to borrow.


   Unsecured Loan vs. Payday Loan  

Alternative lenders, such as payday lenders or companies that offer merchant cash advances, do not offer secured loans in the traditional sense. Their loans are not secured by tangible collateral in the way that mortgages and car loans are. However, these lenders take other measures to secure repayment.



Payday lenders, for example, require that borrowers give them a postdated check or agree to an automatic withdrawal from their checking accounts to repay the loan. Many online merchant cash advance lenders require the borrower to pay a certain percentage of online sales through a payment-processing service such as PayPal. These loans are considered unsecured even though they are partially secured.






Payday loans may be considered predatory loans, as they have a reputation for extremely high interest and hidden terms that charge borrowers added fees. In fact, some states have banned them.


   Special Considerations  

While lenders can decide whether or not to approve an unsecured loan based on your creditworthiness, laws protect borrowers from discriminatory lending practices. The enactment of the Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA) in 1974, for example, made it illegal for lenders to use race, color, sex, religion, or other non-creditworthiness factors when evaluating a loan application, establishing terms of a loan, or any other aspect of a credit transaction.



While lending practices have gradually become more equitable in the United States, discrimination still occurs. In July 2020, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), which takes the lead in supervising compliance and enforcing the ECOA, issued a Request for Information soliciting public comments to identify opportunities for improving what the ECOA does to ensure nondiscriminatory access to credit. “Clear standards help protect African Americans and other minorities, but the CFPB must back them up with action to make sure lenders and others follow the law,” stated Kathleen L. Kraninger, then-director of the CFPB.




What is considered collateral?
Collateral is any item that can be taken to satisfy the value of a loan. Common forms of collateral are real estate, automobiles, jewelry, and other items of value.




Is a co-signed loan considered secured?
Although having a co-signer may help you get approved for a loan, it doesn’t make the loan secured. In the case of a default, the lender would require the co-signer to repay the loan.




Can bankruptcy eliminate all unsecured loans?
Declaring bankruptcy is a serious undertaking, but in most cases, it will clear your unsecured loans. There is one exception, though: student loans. While some student loans may be forgiven in the event of bankruptcy, many are not, leaving the debtor still obligated to pay them.


   The Bottom Line  

Unsecured loans are common but can bear significant risk for both the lender and the borrower. Before taking out any unsecured loan, assess your financial health and your ability to repay the loan. Borrowing money that you can’t repay can result in garnishment of wages and tax returns and put the borrower on a difficult path back to solvency.
What Is an Unsecured Note?  

An unsecured note is a loan that is not secured by the issuer's assets. Unsecured notes are similar to debentures but offer a higher rate of return. Unsecured notes provide less security than a debenture. Such notes are also often uninsured and subordinated. The note is structured for a fixed period.





Key Takeaways

An unsecured note is a corporate debt that does not have collateral attached and is, therefore, a riskier prospect for an investor.It's different from debentures, unsecured corporate debt that often have insurance policies to payout in case of a default.Companies sell the unsecured notes through private placements to raise money for purchases, share buyback, and other corporate purposes.Because unsecured debt isn't backed by collateral and is a higher risk, the interest rates offered are higher than secured debt backed by collateral.


   Understanding Unsecured Note  

Companies sell unsecured notes through private offerings to generate money for corporate initiatives such as share repurchases and acquisitions. An unsecured note is not backed by any collateral and thus presents more risk to lenders. Due to the higher risk involved, these notes' interest rates are higher than with secured notes.



In contrast, a secured note is a loan backed by the borrower's assets, such as a mortgage or auto loan. If the borrower defaults, these assets will go towards the repayment of the note. For this reason, collateral assets must be worth at least as much as the note. Additional examples of collateral that can be pledged include stocks, bonds, jewelry, and artwork.


   Unsecured Note and Credit Rating  

Credit rating agencies will often rate debt issuers. For example, in the case of Fitch, this agency will offer a letter-based credit rating that reflects the chances that the issuer will default, based on internal (i.e., the stability of cash flows) and external (market-based) factors.


  Investment Grade  

AAA: Companies of exceptionally high quality (reliable, with consistent cash flows)AA: Still high quality; slightly more risk than AAAA: Low default risk; somewhat more vulnerable to business or economic factorsBBB: Low expectation of default; business or economic factors could adversely affect the company


  Non-Investment Grade  

BB: Elevated vulnerability to default risk, more susceptible to adverse shifts in business or economic conditions; still financially flexibilityB: Degrading financial situation; highly speculativeCCC: Real possibility of defaultCC: Default is probablyC: Default or default-like process has begunRD: Issuer has defaulted on a paymentD: Defaulted






Unsecured debt holders are second to secured debt holders in the event of needing to claim assets in the wake of a company's liquidation.


   Special Considerations  

Liquidation occurs when a company is insolvent and cannot pay its obligations when they come due. As company operations come to an end, its remaining assets go towards paying creditors and shareholders who purchased stakes and/or made loans as the company expanded. Each of these parties has a priority in the order of claims to company assets.



The most senior claims belong to secured creditors, followed by unsecured creditors, including bondholders, the government (if the company owes taxes), and employees (if the company owes them unpaid wages or other obligations). Finally, shareholders receive any remaining assets, beginning with those holding preferred stock followed by holders of common stock.
What Is Unskilled Labor?  

"Unskilled labor" is an outdated term, once used to describe a segment of the workforce associated with a limited skill set or minimal economic value for the work performed. The correct term is low-wage labor.



According to the Center for Global Development the term unskilled and skilled were derived from institutions, politicians, and other interest groups based on the classifications a determination has been made as to who is and is not powerful in the labor market. Also, the idea that the unskilled labor force is characterized by lower educational attainment such as a high school diploma, GED, or lack thereof which typically results in lower wages, is also outdated.



Once characterized by lower educational attainment, such as a high school diploma, GED, or lack thereof, it was assumed unskilled laborers made less money. However, in the 21st century, there are jobs for high school graduates or those without a college degree.





Key Takeaways

Unskilled labor is an antiquated term.Those in the workforce with limited skills aren't necessarily unskilled.It is possible to find a job with a GED or high school diploma.Some jobs call for a strict set of skills or degrees, but it is possible to find well-paying work without them. Unskilled laborers were once thought of as workers whose daily production tasks did not depend on technical abilities or skills.


   Understanding Unskilled Labor  

Again, unskilled labor is an outdated term, but low-wage laborers provide a significant part of the overall labor market, performing daily production tasks that do not depend on technical abilities or skills. Menial or repetitive tasks are typical unskilled labor positions. Jobs that can be fully learned in less than 30 days often fall into the low-wage labor category. Low-wage labor jobs may be held by individuals with less education or experience than others. When this is the case, employers may take advantage of these workers, offering low to minimum wage as pay.



When the term is used to describe a person or employee completing the tasks, low-wage labor refers to the lack of education or experience the person may have. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, the federal minimum wage is $7.25 although many cities and states have a higher minimum wage for workers.






Certain semiskilled jobs, such as administrative assistants, can require advanced skill sets that lead them to be categorized as skilled instead of semiskilled positions.


   Related Terms  

All jobs from babysitter to biology professor require a skill set. However, some jobs and careers require higher education, special certifications, or a specified number of years of experience. Entry-level positions can be low-wage jobs with rising salaries, as more experience is gained. Some low-wage jobs only pay federal minimum wage, which does not often increase on the job, despite the use of skills and experience of the low-wage worker. Rising skills and pay may depend on the employer and the position.



Jobs that call for semi-skilled or mid-skilled workers, typically require a level of education or knowledge in a particular field, or experience and training in order to complete the job's tasks successfully.



Skilled labor may refer to persons or positions requiring a very specialized skill set or advanced degree in order to complete some of the assigned tasks.




What Is Minimum Wage?
The federal minimum wage is $7.25 an hour.




What Does Skilled Labor Mean?
All jobs take some sort of skill to hold them but skilled labor usually refers to positions which needs a very specific skill set to a obtain such as computer coding or plumbing skills, or a teaching certificate.




How Many States Have Higher Minimum Wages?
There are 30 states plus Washington D.C., that offer workers a wage above the federal minimum wage.


   The Bottom Line  

The term "low-skilled" worker is an antiquated term, not reflective of the present day. Low-wage workers are not low-skilled workers. Low-wage workers may have plenty of skills, but often the low-wage jobs do not provide a liveable wage.
What Is an Unsolicited Application?  

An unsolicited application is a request for life insurance coverage that is made by an individual rather than an insurance agent or broker. 



Life insurance companies generally heavily scrutinize this type of application because of the likelihood of self-selection, which refers to the probability that individuals with higher health risks will seek insurance on their own instead of through an insurance professional.





Key Takeaways

An unsolicited application is a life insurance request that is made directly from an individual, versus an agent or broker.Such applications often raise concerns among insurers, as they tend to be from consumers with higher health risks.This category of insurance seekers is seen as being "self-selected" because they have self-selected into a group, which can then skew the group toward higher risks or higher payouts for the insurer.Some life insurers will refuse self-selected, or unsolicited applications, while others will accept the applicants but charge higher rates to account for the higher risk the applicants pose.An unsolicited application may also refer to a job application where the applicant applies of their own accord and not as a reaction to a specific job opening. 


   Understanding an Unsolicited Application  

A person with a suspected or known health problem, such as heart disease, may try to submit an unsolicited application to purchase life insurance before seeking medical treatment for the condition. These applicants could weigh the insured pool towards bad risks. For this reason, the insurers try to screen out self-selection applicants either by requiring higher rates or by denying coverage altogether.



The reason for insurance carriers' extreme scrutiny of self-selecting insurance applicants can be explained by a statistics concept called self-selection bias. Self-selection bias arises in any situation (not just buying insurance) in which individuals "select" themselves into a group, causing a biased sample and abnormal or undesirable conditions in the group. It is closely related to the non-response bias, which describes when a group of people responding has different responses than the group of people not responding.






Self-selection is typically a choice an individual makes when an emergency or sudden need for coverage comes up, therefore making the person a higher risk for an insurer to cover.


   Disadvantages of Unsolicited Insurance Applications  

Self-selection makes determining the cause more difficult, which makes determining risk levels problematic for insurance actuaries. Due to self-selection, there may be a number of differences between the people who choose to apply for insurance and those who are led into it as a course of their life and life decisions. These motivations can vary, but self-selection is typically something a person does after suddenly recognizing they have an urgent need for insurance.



There are significant differences between self-selecting populations and those who aren't self-selecting. An outcome might be that those who elect to submit an unsolicited insurance application have higher-than-normal risks, and this can skew risk pools and throw off the accuracy of mortality tables, for example. A relative measure of 'improvement' might improve the reliability of the study somewhat, but only partially.



Self-selection bias also causes problems in other fields where statistical averages might not follow expected patterns. For example, research about programs or products, in particular, is susceptible to biased evaluations of people who have self-selected to be part of a product research project.


   Special Considerations  

A distinct but related term is an unsolicited applicant. Unsolicited applicants are those who apply for a job without any advertisement or requirement from the company.



For example, a job seeker may visit a company's website, find contact information for someone who works at the company and send them their resume. Some people choose to do this on the basis that companies don't always advertise all of their job openings. This type of applicant applies of their own accord—not in response to any specific job opening.



As a general rule of thumb, the higher up in a company that a position is, the more one can assume that it is not advertised. This is because companies will usually first look for applicants internally and in their networks. Keeping unqualified applicants as low as possible saves companies time and money.
What Is an Unsolicited Bid?  

An unsolicited bid is an offer made by an individual, investor, or company to purchase a company that is not actively seeking a buyer. Unsolicited bids may sometimes be referred to as hostile bids if the target company doesn't want to be acquired. They usually come up when a potential acquirer sees value in the target company.





Key Takeaways

An unsolicited bid is made to purchase a company not actively seeking a buyer.Unsolicited bids are also referred to as hostile takeovers.Companies make unsolicited bids to control market share, increase profits, and/or limit competition. A company may reject the offer or set up an employee stock ownership plan to avoid being the target of an unsolicited bid.


   How Unsolicited Bids Work  

An unsolicited bid comes about when a potential acquirer takes an interest in a target company and makes a bid to purchase it. In this case, the bid is the result of the acquirer's initiative rather than at the request of the bid-upon company.



An unsolicited bid to purchase a company not intending to be sold may be followed by other unsolicited bids as the news travels. These other bids may up the purchase price and start a bidding war or takeover fight.



While unsolicited bids may involve private companies, many bids are made by publicly-traded companies. These kinds of bids were popular in the 1980s when many bidders recognized the potential for profit in undervalued companies or those that were mismanaged.


   Unsolicited Bid vs. Solicited Bid  

An unsolicited bid may come as a surprise to the target, while a solicited bid is the opposite. With a solicited bid, the target is actively seeking a purchaser and wants to be purchased. These kinds of bids are often called friendly takeovers, or proposals that are approved by the management of both companies.





$180.95 billion

The amount Vodafone paid for Germany's Mannesmann in 2000 after its original unsolicited offer was rejected. This is said to be one of the world's largest acquisitions.


   Why Do Companies Make Unsolicited Bids?  

Unsolicited bidding typically occurs when a company wants to purchase another company in order to:



Control its market share.
Profit from its expected growth.
Have access to proprietary technology.
Limit competitors from taking advantage of these situations.
Buy the target company and break it up.


   How To Avoid or Fight off an Unsolicited Bid  

A vulnerable company may have several mechanisms with which to defend itself if it becomes the target of an unsolicited offer or, ultimately, a hostile takeover. First, it can reject the offer outright. If that doesn't work, there is the people poison pill defense, where the management of the target company threatens to resign in the event of a takeover. This would force the acquirer to assemble a new management team if the acquisition was successful, which may be costly.



Another defense mechanism is the poison pill, where shareholders buy more company stock at a discount, thereby raising the number of shares the bidder will have to purchase to realize the unsolicited bid. Another way to avoid being a target is to set up an employee stock ownership plan, which would allow employees to buy shares in the company, thereby giving them the ability to vote alongside management about important decisions involving the company.


   Example of an Unsolicited Bid  

Company ABC, an African oil company, makes an unsolicited offer to purchase another African oil company, Company DEF. Company ABC believes that by purchasing DEF, it will remove a competitor, grow its business by expanding its market share, and absorb the cutting-edge technology that DEF has created.



ABC offers $1 billion in a proposed all-cash deal; however, DEF believes the price is too low and turns the deal down. ABC comes back with another unsolicited bid in the amount of $1.4 billion. DEF ponders this deal until Company XYZ, a Saudi oil company, makes an unsolicited bid of $2 billion.



This price is considered high by market analysts and is too expensive for Company ABC to compete with. XYZ has significant reserves of cash on hand and covets DEF's technology. The offer is accepted by DEF and the merger goes through with XYZ.




What Is the Difference Between Unsolicited and Solicited?
The difference between an unsolicited bid and a solicited bid is that in a solicited bid, the target company wants to be sold and is actively seeking a buyer. An unsolicited bid is when the target company is not actively seeking a buyer and may not be interested at all in being acquired.




What Is a Hostile Takeover?
A hostile takeover is when a company or investment firm tries to purchase a company that does not want to be acquired. A hostile takeover usually involves going over the management team directly to the shareholders or buying up large percentages of a company's shares to obtain a position of control.




What Is the Difference Between a Merger and an Acquisition?
A merger is when two companies come together and combine their resources and respective advantages to create a brand-new company. An acquisition is when a company buys another company and the company that is bought is folded into the company that bought it.
What Is an Unsponsored ADR?  

An unsponsored ADR is an American depositary receipt (ADR) issued by a depositary bank without the involvement, participation, or consent of the foreign company it represents ownership in.





Key Takeaways

An unsponsored ADR is an American depositary receipt issued by a depositary bank without the involvement, participation, or consent of the foreign company.These securities trade on the over-the-counter market rather than on American stock exchanges.Unlike regular ADRs and stock, shareholder benefits and voting rights may not be extended to investors who hold unsponsored ADRs.


   Understanding Unsponsored ADRs  

ADRs are negotiable certificates that represent a certain number of shares in a foreign company. ADRs are issued by banks outside the U.S. and trade just like shares on American stock exchanges in U.S. dollars. These securities allow foreign corporations to enter the American financial markets and attract American capital. They also give American investors a way to invest in foreign companies they may otherwise not be able to access.



ADRs can be sponsored or unsponsored. A sponsored one is issued in collaboration with the foreign company, while an unsponsored ADR is established without the company's cooperation.



How does an ADR get established in the U.S. without a company's consent? The answer is simple—demand. A depository entity can issue certificates when there's heavy demand from investors for ownership in a specific company from abroad. The issuing entity is normally a broker-dealer that owns common stock in the company.






Unsponsored ADRs are normally issued by broker-dealers that own common stock in a foreign company.



Because they're issued without the consent or cooperation of the foreign company, unsponsored ADRs generally trade over-the-counter (OTC)—rather than on a stock exchange. And there's another catch. Shareholder benefits and voting rights may not be extended to the holders of these particular securities.


   Special Considerations  

Since depository banks were not required to notify the underlying issuers or obtain permission before registering unsponsored ADRs with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), there was a rush to bring them to market, resulting in multiple unsponsored ADRs sometimes being created for the same issuer.



The number of unsponsored ADR issues surged after Oct. 10, 2008, when the SEC amended an exemption applicable to foreign issuers. This exemption allowed them to have their securities traded through the U.S. OTC market without the registration required under Section 12(g) of the SEC Act of 1934 (SEA).



This amendment eliminated the written application and paper submission requirements by providing an automatic exemption from Section 12(g) to foreign issuers that met certain conditions. These conditions required the issuer to maintain a listing of its shares in its primary market outside the U.S. and publish electronically specified non-U.S. disclosure documents in English.


   Unsponsored ADRs vs. Sponsored ADRs  

As mentioned above, sponsored ADRs have the full cooperation of the foreign company, enabling them to tap into international capital markets directly. Although a sponsored ADR would be listed in the United States, the issuing company still has its revenue and profit denominated in its home currency.



There are three levels of sponsored ADRs:



Level I sponsored ADRs: These can only be traded OTC and not on an official U.S. exchange. A Level I sponsored ADR is easier to set up for foreign companies since it does not require the same disclosures or the need to abide by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). There is some degree of risk with Level I sponsored ADRs given their relative lack of transparency.
Level II sponsored ADRs: These ADRs can be listed on an exchange, meaning they're visible to a wider market and require the company to comply with the SEC.
Level III sponsored ADRs: The final level of sponsored ADRs permit companies to issue shares to raise capital, but require the highest level of compliance and disclosure.






More than 2,000 ADRs—both sponsored and unsponsored—traded in the United States in 2012, according to the SEC.


   Example of an Unsponsored ADR  

Many large global corporations use unsponsored ADRs to attract American capital. For example, American investors can invest in Royal Mail PLC, a postal and delivery service company from the United Kingdom that was founded by Henry VIII. The company's unsponsored ADR trades OTC under the ticker symbol ROYMY.
What Is Unstated Interest Paid?  

Unstated interest paid is the amount of money the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) assumes has been paid to the seller of an item that has been sold on an installment basis. Unstated interest must be calculated in some cases when you have sold an item on installment basis, but have charged the customer little or no interest. Because interest income must sometimes be treated differently than other types of income, it may be necessary to estimate which portion of an installment payment is actually interest income.﻿﻿


   Understanding Unstated Interest Paid  

Unstated interest paid is only calculated for contracts in which interest payments are not included, or when the interest charged falls below the test rate of interest. If a contract or invoice describes both an interest payment and a principal payment, the interest payment is referred to as stated interest. Stated interest in an installment contract must be greater than the test rate of interest, which in most cases is the based on the applicable federal rates (AFRs).﻿﻿



The applicable federal rate is calculated by the IRS and published monthly online and by various financial news sources. The IRS publishes three different applicable rates: short-term, mid-term and long-term rates.﻿﻿ ﻿﻿ The short-term rate is calculated by averaging the rates the government pays on bond issues with maturities of three years or less. The mid-term rate is derived from averaging the rate paid on Treasury securities between three and nine years in maturity, while the long-term rate is based on issues of ten years or longer in maturity.﻿﻿ To calculate unstated interest paid, sellers of goods paid for on installment should choose the applicable federal rate based on the length of the installment contract.﻿﻿


   Example of Unstated Interest Paid  

Let’s say that Ernie’s Tractor Supply company sells a tractor to a customer for $10,000, and allows the customer to pay for the tractor in installments: $5,000 in six months from now, and another $5,000 one year from now. On the customer contract for this installment plan, there is no amount that is stipulated for interest paid. For tax purposes, you may need to recognize that this arrangement involves the implicit lending of the customer two $5,000 loans: one with a maturity of six months, and the other for one year. 



If the applicable federal rate for this loan is 2% per year, then the interest you would pay on the two $5,000 loans would end up being roughly $150 dollars. The IRS would assume that you have sold the Tractor for $9,850 and issued two loans that paid interest income of $150.
What Is an Unsterilized Foreign Exchange Intervention?  

The term unsterilized foreign exchange intervention refers to how a country's monetary authorities influence exchange rates and its money supply—by not purchasing foreign or by not selling domestic currencies or assets. This kind of approach is considered passive to exchange rate fluctuations, allowing for fluctuations in the monetary base.



Unsterilized foreign exchange interventions are also called nonsterilized interventions and can be contrasted with sterilized interventions.





Key Takeaways

Unsterilized foreign exchange interventions take place when a country's monetary authorities influence exchange rates and its money supply.This policy takes place when a central bank doesn't offset the purchase or sale of foreign or domestic currencies or assets with another transaction.When central banks implement unsterilized foreign exchange intervention, they do not put insulation measures in place.Unsterilized interventions allow foreign exchange markets to function without manipulating the domestic currency supply, so a country's monetary base can change.


   How Unsterilized Foreign Exchange Interventions Work  

Central banks may be able to weaken a currency by selling their own reserves on the market. They can also strengthen it by buying more and selling their own currency. Sterilization happens when authorities offset the purchase of foreign currencies or securities by selling domestic ones, therefore dropping its own money supply. Central banks use sterilization as a way to insulate or protect their economies against any negative impact from things like currency appreciation or inflation—both of which can reduce a country's place in export competitiveness in the global market.






Sterilization can be used to insulate or protect economies against any negative impact from currency appreciation or inflation



When central banks implement unsterilized foreign exchange intervention, they do not put insulation measures in place. Therefore, the transaction is one-sided—only purchasing or selling currencies or assets—without being offset. The policy allows foreign exchange markets to function without manipulating the supply of the domestic currency. This means that a country's monetary base is allowed to change.



For example, the Federal Reserve may decide to strengthen the Japanese yen by buying Japanese government bonds, increasing its own reserves of the foreign country's assets. The intervention is unsterilized if the Fed decides not to sell its own bonds in reserves on the open market.


   Unsterilized vs. Sterilized Foreign Exchange Interventions  

As noted above, central bank authorities use sterilized and nonsterilized methods of foreign exchange intervention when and if they want to influence exchange rates and/or the money supply. If the central bank purchases domestic currency by selling foreign assets, the money supply shrinks because it has removed domestic currency from the market. This is an example of a sterilized policy.



If a currency's value starts to weaken in the global market, that country's central bank can step in and try to influence the exchange rate by creating demand for the currency. The bank can buy its own currency by using foreign currency that it has in its own reserves. This not only cuts off the currency's depreciation, but also controls the money supply by reducing the amount in circulation. The same is true if the central bank decides to do the opposite—by selling its own currency if it appreciates too much.
What Is Unsubordinated Debt?  

Unsubordinated debt, also known as a senior security or senior debt, refers to a type of obligation that must be repaid before any other form of debt. So, holders of unsubordinated debt have the first claim over a company's assets or earnings if the debtor goes bankrupt or insolvent. Because unsubordinated debt comes with a guarantee of repayment, they are considered less risky than other types of debt.





Key Takeaways

Unsubordinated debt is an obligation that must be repaid before any other form of debt if the debtor goes bankrupt or insolvent.The majority of unsubordinated debt is usually secured by collateral.This kind of debt is also known as a senior security or senior debt.Types of unsubordinated debt include exchange-traded notes, collateralized securities, and certificates of deposit.


   How Unsubordinated Debt Works  

When a company goes bankrupt or insolvent, there is normally a chain or ranking of creditors who get paid in a specific order. Lenders of unsubordinated debt get paid out in full first by the company. The majority of this type of debt is usually secured by collateral.



Most loans from financial institutions and certain high-grade debt securities such as mortgage bonds are deemed senior debt. Loans are also considered unsubordinated based on the balance and the length of time outstanding in comparison with other loans.



Because senior debt has a relatively secure claim, it is considered to be less risky. As such, it pays a lower rate of interest compared to other types of debt. This means lenders are willing to compensate for lower borrowing rates by claiming a higher priority over a borrower’s assets since they will be repaid first during a liquidation event.






Because they come with some security, unsubordinated debt lenders normally charge lower interest rates to their debtors.



After unsubordinated debt lenders are paid, any remaining money goes to preferred stock holders, subordinated debt, followed by common shareholders.


   Types of Unsubordinated Debt  

Examples of unsubordinated debt include exchange-traded notes (ETNs), collateralized securities, and certificates of deposit (CDs). Collateralized securities such as mortgage-backed securities (MBS) are structured with a number of tranches that bear different risks, interest rates, and maturities. Tranches with a higher claim on underlying assets are safer than junior tranches with a second lien. Senior tranches also have a higher credit rating than junior tranches and are paid first.


   Unsubordinated vs. Subordinated Debt  

Unsubordinated debt is the opposite of subordinated debt. This type of debt vehicle is ranked below all senior debts of a company. Subordinated debt is also called junior debt, and is subject to subordination in the event of default or bankruptcy.



When a company’s assets are liquidated to pay off its debt obligations, subordinated debt holders receive payment after all unsubordinated debt lenders and preferred stockholders are paid. In some cases, there is no cash left after paying the unsubordinated lenders, which means every other creditor remains unpaid.



Because there is more risk associated with subordinated debt, these lenders normally charge higher interest rates compared to unsubordinated debt.
What Is Unsubscribed?  

The term unsubscribed refers to any shares that are part of an initial public offering (IPO) that are not purchased ahead of the official release date. This means there is little to no interest in the security in advance of the company's IPO.



Put simply, being unsubscribed means that demand for shares is low. Analysts and investors may safely assume that IPOs that become subscribed are overpriced. Being unsubscribed may prevent companies from raising the capital they need to meet their goals.





Key Takeaways

Unsubscribed refers to a portion of shares in an IPO that remain unsold.Demand for shares is generally lower than supply if an IPO is unsubscribed.Some of the reasons for being unsubscribed include an overpriced IPO, problems with the company, and overall market conditions.Being unsubscribed means that companies won't be able to raise the money they need to keep their companies operational or to fund their growth plans.Companies with unsubscribed shares may consider taking on more debt or selling their businesses as alternatives to an IPO.


   Understanding Unsubscribed  

Private companies go through the IPO process when they want to go public. Doing so allows them to go to the market and sell shares in order to raise money for their day-to-day operations and growth plans. An IPO subscription refers to an order placed by an investor—usually an institutional investor—for newly-issued securities before they are officially issued. These shares are issued directly by the company rather than through a broker on the secondary market.



Unsubscribed shares refer to the portion of any stock that remains unsold before the IPO. This means that demand for company stock is low and is outweighed by the overall supply. As noted above, it is often a sign that the company and its underwriters have priced the IPO share price too high.



Companies that go through the IPO process generally have a target in mind as to how much capital they intend to raise from the offering. Being unsubscribed means that they won't be able to raise the capital they initially hoped. As such, it may lead to a disruption in their day-to-day operations or growth plans. To an individual investor or analyst, the lack of interest may be taken as a sign that an IPO is going to be a flop.



Unsubscribed shares may rise or fall according to the whims of the open market. They can then be purchased or sold only among investors on the secondary market, primarily through the public stock exchanges or by using a broker.






In unsubscribed IPOs, which may also be called undersubscribed, the issuing company may recall the shares and reimburse the few buyers who expressed interest. This is in contrast to an oversubscribed IPO, in which investor demand far outweighs the supply of shares available. The underwriters responsible for an oversubscribed offering can adjust the price or offer more shares to meet the demand.


   Preparing for an IPO  

A company’s IPO is typically underwritten by an investment bank. This institution tries to determine the offering price that will result in an optimal number of subscriptions. Setting an offering price that's too high will likely result in the shares being unsubscribed. As such, the size of the unsubscribed portion of the IPO can affect the overall price of an entire lot of shares. The issuing company in the IPO may require an underwriter to buy the unsubscribed portion.


   Reasons for Unsubscribed Shares  

As mentioned earlier, the primary reason is often due to the fact that the IPO share price is set far too high. But there are other reasons why an IPO may be unsubscribed. Some of these include:



Problems with the company (financial irregularities, corporate management issues, etc.)
A failure to generate interest with investors
A lack of marketing and promotion, which can lead to very little knowledge of the IPO
Overall market conditions
An ill-timed IPO (especially during times of financial and economic stress)


   Other Funding Options  

Successful IPOs (subscribed and oversubscribed ones) are those that raise a lot of capital. This helps keep the business afloat while allowing it to fund its operations and growth strategies. But what happens when an IPO becomes unsubscribed and fails?



Companies may have to find other ways to raise money. Some of these options include:



Debt financing
Raising money through government grants
Opening up additional financing rounds for existing investors
Selling the company


   Example of Unsubscribed  

Here's a hypothetical example to show how unsubscribed shares work. Let's say that Company X is about to go public and wants to issue an IPO of eight million shares. Its investment bank underwrites the IPO, prepares documents detailing the company’s business model and financial outlook, and then shops this information to potential buyers to see if they will subscribe to the offering, or agree to buy shares of it prior to its release. Most of these potential buyers are institutional investors or other large-scale buyers.



Once the underwriting bank gauges the level of interest, it will decide how many shares to sell and at what price. But let’s assume that the underwriting bank finds buyers for seven million of Company X’s eight million shares, and it agrees to sell those shares for $20 apiece. One million of the shares remain unsubscribed. Company X may not earn as much from its IPO as it had hoped to earn.




What Is the Purpose of an Initial Public Offering?
An initial public offering allows companies to go to the market to raise money by issuing shares to investors. By selling shares, the company agrees to cede ownership to shareholders in exchange for the capital. The money raised by selling shares allows the business to remain operating and fund its growth plans. The company may also be able to delay having to assume (more) debt to keep itself afloat.




What Is an Oversubscribed IPO?
An oversubscribed IPO is the opposite of an undersubscribed one. This means that the IPO has a lot of interest from investors. As such, demand far outweighs the available supply of shares. Underwriters can make changes to the offer price or they can increase the number of shares in order to meet demand.




Who Buys Unsubscribed Shares?
When an IPO is unsubscribed, there are shares that remain unsold. In this case, the issuing company may require the underwriting bank(s) to purchase any or all of the portion of unsubscribed shares.




How Do IPO Underwriters Get Paid?
The issuing company selects an underwriting bank that works for its interests. Other institutions may be required, depending on the size and nature of the IPO. The original underwriter becomes the lead and forms a syndicate.Underwriters are generally guaranteed a fee for their services. The lead receives a portion of the gross spread, which is fixed as a percentage of the IPO proceeds. The remaining portion is split between the remaining underwriters. The company may also agree to cover other costs, including out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the underwriter(s) during the process.
What is an Unsuitable Investment (Unsuitability)?  

An unsuitable investment is when an investment— such as a stock or bond—does not meet the objectives and means of an investor. The investment strategy may also be unsuitable. For example, the portfolio asset mix could be wrong, or the investments purchased may be too aggressive or too low-risk for what the client needs or wants. 



In most parts of the world, financial professionals have a duty to take steps that ensure an investment is suitable for a client. In the United States, these rules are enforced by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA). Suitability is not the same as a fiduciary responsibility.  





Key Takeaways

An unsuitable investment is one that does not serve an investors goals and needs as well as it could. Financial professionals have a general duty to offer investments that are suitable to a customer’s needs.Even those who are not strictly bound by a fiduciary duty are expected to avoid offering unsuitable investments.


   Understanding an Unsuitable Investment (Unsuitability)  

Unsuitable investments vary between market participants. No investment, other than outright scams, are inherently suitable or unsuitable. Suitability depends on the investor's situation and will vary between investors based on their characteristics and goals. 



In order to ensure that suitable investments are offered, FINRA rules require investment firms to seek information about a customer’s age, other investments, financial situation and needs, tax status, investment objectives, investment experience; investment time horizon, liquidity needs, and risk tolerance. Customers are not required to provide this information, so there is some flexibility if they do not. Having this information helps firms avoid offering unsuitable investments to a customer. 



For example, for an 85-year-old widow living on fixed income, speculative investments such as options, futures, and penny stocks may be unsuitable because the widow has a low-risk tolerance. She is using the capital in her investments accounts, along with the returns, to live. She, and her investment advisor, would likely be unwilling to put her capital at excessive risk as there is minimal time left on her investment horizon to recoup losses should they occur.



On the other hand, a person in their twenties or thirties may be willing to take on more risk. They are still working and do not yet require their investments to live off. More risk could result in higher returns over the long-run, and the longer investment horizon means they have time to recoup any short-term losses which may occur. Very low-risk investments may be unsuitable for this investor.



Age is not the only factor when determining which investments are unsuitable. Income, expected future income, financial knowledge, lifestyle, and personal preferences are a few of the other factors that must also be considered. For example, some people just prefer to play it safe, while others are risk-takers. 



The sleep test is a simple concept that helps in this regard: if an investor can't sleep because of their investments, something is wrong. Alter the risk level until comfortable. Risk is then combined and counterbalanced with the other factors to find suitable investments or to create the proper investment strategy.


   Fiduciary Responsibility  

Suitability and unsuitability are not the same as fiduciary responsibility. They are essentially different levels of client care, with fiduciary responsibility being the stricter protocol. A fee-based investment adviser has a fiduciary responsibility to find investments and investment strategies that are suitable for their client. A commission-based financial advisor or broker, maybe that you get on the phone at your broker's call center, typically doesn't have a fiduciary responsibility to a client, but they will still seek out suitable investments.
What Is Unsystematic Risk?  

Unsystematic risk is the risk that is unique to a specific company or industry. It's also known as nonsystematic risk, specific risk, diversifiable risk, or residual risk. In the context of an investment portfolio, unsystematic risk can be reduced through diversification—while systematic risk is the risk that's inherent in the market.





Key Takeaways

Unsystematic risk, or company-specific risk, is a risk associated with a particular investment.Unsystematic risk can be mitigated through diversification, and so is also known as diversifiable risk.Once diversified, investors are still subject to market-wide systematic risk.Total risk is unsystematic risk plus systematic risk.Systematic risk is attributed to broad market factors and is the investment portfolio risk that is not based on individual investments.

   Understanding Unsystematic Risk  

Unsystematic risk can be described as the uncertainty inherent in a company or industry investment. Examples of unsystematic risk include a new competitor in the marketplace with the potential to take significant market share from the company invested in, a regulatory change (which could drive down company sales), a shift in management, or a product recall.



While investors may be able to anticipate some sources of unsystematic risk, it is nearly impossible to be aware of all risks. For instance, an investor in healthcare stocks may be aware that a major shift in health policy is on the horizon, but may not fully know the particulars of the new laws and how companies and consumers will respond.



Other examples of unsystematic risks may include strikes, outcomes of legal proceedings, or natural disasters. This risk is also known as a diversifiable risk since it can be eliminated by sufficiently diversifying a portfolio. There isn't a formula for calculating unsystematic risk; instead, it must be extrapolated by subtracting the systematic risk from the total risk.


   Types of Unsystematic Risk  
  Business Risk  

Both internal and external issues may cause business risk. Internal risks are tied to operational efficiencies. For example, management failing to take out a patent to protect a new product would be an internal risk, as it may result in the loss of competitive advantage.



The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) banning a specific drug that a company sells is an example of external business risk. Most recently, TikTok, the Chinese-owned, internet dynamo, has been banned from most US state and federal government devices. Meanwhile a broader consideration to totally ban TikTok in the US has evolved as a new unsystematic risk.


  Financial Risk  

Financial risk relates to the capital structure of a company. A company needs to have an optimal level of debt and equity to continue to grow and meet its financial obligations. A weak capital structure may lead to inconsistent earnings and cash flow that could prevent a company from trading. In the current environment of the Fed raising interest rates, some companies balance sheets may be stuck with lower-yielding investments. With interest rates moving higher, they would presumably seek to replace existing low-yield debt with newer, higher-yielding debt investments.


  Operational Risk  

Operational risks can result from unforeseen or negligent events, such as a breakdown in the supply chain or a critical error being overlooked in the manufacturing process. A security breach could expose confidential information about customers or other types of key proprietary data to criminals. 



Operational risk is tied to operations and the potential for failed systems or policies. These are the risks for day-to-day operations and can result from breakdowns in internal procedures, whether tied to systems or employees. For example, a refinery may experience a leak from one of its holding tanks, shutting down production until the damage can be repaired. Meanwhile, the refinery is offline and not producing the refined products that customers are demanding, leaving the refinery without any income for a period of time.


  Strategic Risk  

A strategic risk may occur if a business gets stuck selling goods or services in a dying industry without a solid plan to evolve the company's offerings. A company may also encounter this risk by entering into a flawed partnership with another firm or competitor that hurts their future prospects for growth. In the current environment, there is a rush to develop electronic cars, for example, opening up a whole new field of competition within the auto industry. Those late to the game are facing significant strategic risk.


  Legal and Regulatory Risk   

Legal and regulatory risk is the risk that a change in laws or regulations will hurt a business. These changes can increase operational costs or introduce legal hurdles. More drastic legal or regulation changes can even stop a business from operating altogether, such as with the potential ban on TikTok in the US by the US government. Other types of legal risk can include errors in agreements or violations of laws.






   Unsystematic Risk vs. Systematic Risk  

Total risk for investments is unsystematic risk plus systematic risk. Unsystematic risk is a risk specific to a company or industry, while systematic risk is the risk tied to the broader market. Systematic risk is attributed to broad market factors and is the investment portfolio risk that is not based on individual investments. 



Types of systematic risks can include interest rate changes, recessions, or inflation. Systematic risk is often calculated with beta, which measures the volatility of a stock or portfolio relative to the entire market. Meanwhile, company risk is a bit more difficult to measure or calculate.






Systematic and unsystematic risks can be mitigated, in part, with risk management. Systematic risk can be reduced with asset allocation, while unsystematic risk can be limited with diversification. 


   Example of Unsystematic Risk  

By owning a variety of company stocks across different industries, as well as by owning other types of securities in a variety of asset classes, such as Treasuries and municipal securities, investors will be less affected by single events.



For example, an investor, who owned nothing but airline stocks, would face a high level of unsystematic risk (also known as idiosyncratic risk). They would be vulnerable if airline industry employees went on strike, for example. This event could sink airline stock prices, even temporarily. Simply the anticipation of this news could hamper their portfolio.



By adding uncorrelated holdings to their portfolio, such as stocks outside of the transportation industry, this investor would spread out air-travel-specific concerns. Unsystematic risk, in this case, affects not only specific airlines but also several of the industries, such as large food companies, with which many airlines do business. In this regard, the investor could diversify away from public equities altogether by adding U.S. Treasury bonds as additional protection from fluctuations in stock prices.



Even a portfolio of well-diversified assets cannot escape all risk, however. The portfolio will still be exposed to systematic risk, which refers to the uncertainty that faces the market as a whole and includes shifts in interest rates, recessions, financial crises, wars, and natural disasters.




What Are Examples of Unsystematic Risk?
Key examples of unsystematic risk include management inefficiency, flawed business models, liquidity issues, regulatory changes, or worker strikes.




What Is the Difference Between Systematic and Unsystematic Risk?
Systematic risk is not diversifiable (i.e. cannot be avoided), while unsystematic risk can generally be mitigated through diversification. Systematic risk affects the market as a whole and can include purchasing power or interest rate risk. 




What Are Types of Unsystematic Risk?
There are five types of unsystematic risk—business, financial, operational, strategic, and legal/regulatory risk.




How Is Unsystematic Risk Measured?
Unsystematic risk—when it comes to investing in stocks—can be measured by the unsystematic variance. That is calculated by subtracting systematic variance from the total variance.


   The Bottom Line  

Unsystematic risk is diversifiable, meaning that (in investing) if you buy shares of different companies across various industries you can reduce this risk. Unsystematic risks are often tied to a specific company or industry and can be avoided by building a well-diversified portfolio. 



Systematic risk is a non-diversifiable risk or a measure of overall market risk. These factors are beyond the control of the business or investor, such as economic, political, or social factors. Meanwhile, microeconomic factors that affect companies are unsystematic risks, such as an unforeseen rise in oil prices.
What is an Unusual Item?  

An unusual item is a nonrecurring or one-time gain or loss that is not considered part of normal business operations. Unusual gains or losses may be recorded on the income statement as a separate component of income from continuing operations, or alternatively, may be identified in the footnotes to the financial statements or the management discussion and analysis (MD&A) section of the annual report.


   Understanding Unusual Items  

Reporting unusual items separately is important to ensure the transparency of financial reporting. Because unusual items are unlikely to recur, separating these items — either explicitly on an income statement or in the management discussion and analysis (MD&A) or footnotes — allows investors to better assess the income-generating capacity of the core business activities.



Unusual items may include:



restructuring charges inclusive of severance pay and factory closings
asset impairment charges or write-offs
losses from discontinued operations
losses from early retirement of debt
M&A or divestiture-related expenses
gains or losses from sale of assets
gains or losses from a lawsuit
damage costs or slowdown of operations due to a natural disaster
charges stemming from changes in accounting policy



The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), the independent nonprofit organization responsible for issuing generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP), has given management leeway to provide a more descriptive separate line item on the income statement when appropriate, such as "Loss from Hurricane Damages to Office Building."


   Special Considerations  

The treatment of unusual items has several implications related to the analysis of company performance and valuation of its shares, credit agreements, and executive compensation schemes. An analyst would have to make adjustments to the income statement to produce a "clean" EBIT, EBITDA, and net income figures on which to calculate price multiples. Debt agreements would have to specify the exclusions to how certain covenants are calculated. Executive pay plans, too, would need to explain how unusual items are handled in compensation formulas.
What Is an Unweighted Index?  

An unweighted index is comprised of securities with equal weight within the index. An equivalent dollar amount is invested in each of the index components. For an unweighted stock index, one stock's performance will not have a dramatic effect on the performance of the index as a whole.



This differs from weighted indexes, where some stocks are given more percentage weight than others, usually based on their market capitalizations.





Key Takeaways

An unweighted index gives equal allocation to all securities within the index.A weighted index gives more weight to certain securities, typically based on market capitalization. One index type isn't necessarily better than another, they are just showing data in different ways.


   Understanding Unweighted Indexes  

Unweighted indexes are rare, as most indexes are based on market capitalizations, whereby companies with larger market caps are accorded higher index weights than companies with lower market caps.



The most prominent of the unweighted stock indexes is the S&P 500 Equal Weight Index (EWI), which is the unweighted version of the widely-used S&P 500 Index. The S&P 500 EWI includes the same constituents as the capitalization-weighted S&P 500 Index, but each of the 500 companies is allocated a fixed percentage weight of 0.2%.


   Implications for Index Funds and ETFs  

Passive fund managers construct index funds or exchange-traded funds (ETFs) based on leading indexes such as the S&P 500 Index, which is a weighted index. Most choose to mimic their investment vehicles on market capitalization-weighted indexes, which means they must buy more of the stocks that are rising in value to match the index, or sell more of the stocks that are declining in value. This can create a circular situation of momentum where an increase in a stock's value leads to more buying of the stock, which will add to the upward pressure on the price. The reverse is also true on the downside.



An index fund or ETF structured on an unweighted index, on the other hand, sticks to equal allocations among the components of an index. In the case of the S&P 500 Equal Weight Index, the fund manager would periodically rebalance investment amounts so that each is 0.2% of the total.


   Is Unweighted or Weighted Better?  

One type of index isn't necessarily better than another, they are just showing different things. The weighted index shows performance typically by market capitalization, while the unweighted index reflects unweighted performance across the index's components.



One of the pitfalls of a weighted index is that returns will be based largely on the most heavily weighted components, and the smaller component returns may be hidden or have little effect. This could mean that most of the stocks in the S&P 500, for example, are actually declining even though the index is rising because the stocks with the most weight are rising while most of the stocks with little weight are falling.



The flip side of this argument is that smaller companies come and go, and therefore they shouldn't be given as much weight as the large companies with a much larger shareholder base.



An unweighted or equal weight index reflects how a whole pool of stocks is doing. It may be a better index for an investor who isn't investing in the most heavily weighted stocks of a weighted index, or is more interested in whether most stocks are moving higher or lower. The unweighted index does a better job of showing this than a weighted index.



In terms of performance, sometimes an unweighted index outperforms the weighted index, and other times the reverse is true. When deciding which is a better index to track or mimic, look at the performance and volatility of both to assess which is the better option.


   Real-World Example of Weighted and Unweighted  

The Nasdaq 100 Index is one hundred of the largest companies listed on the Nasdaq exchange. It is a weighted index based on market capitalization, although the index caps how much of a weight any individual stock can have.



The Nasdaq 100 Equal Weight Index has an equal weight of 1% assigned to each of the 100 components.



Over time, the weightings can have dramatic effects on returns. The following chart shows the Nasdaq 100 EWI as candles and the Nasdaq 100 as a pink line.



Between 2006 and 2019, the Nasdaq 100 returned 70% more than its EWI counterpart, showing that the larger-cap stocks tended to bolster returns for the weighted index. This may not always be the case. Depending on the index, sometimes the unweighted version outperforms the weighted version.

Along the bottom of the chart is a correlation coefficient, showing that most of the time the two indexes are highly correlated, near a value of one. But on occasion, the two indexes diverge or may not move in the same direction. These are periods where how the index is weighted affects its performance relative to the other.
What Is Unwinding a Position?  

To unwind is to close out a trading position, with the term tending to be used when the trade is complex or large. Unwinding also refers to the correction of a trading error, since correcting a trading error may be complex or require multiple steps or trades. For example, a broker mistakenly sells part of a position when an investor wanted to add to it. The broker would have to unwind the transaction by first buying the sold shares and then purchasing the shares that should have been purchased in the first place.





Key Takeaways

To unwind a position is to close it out. Generally, large and complex trades are candidates for unwinding a position. In some cases, the unwind strategy is also used to correct trade errors. 


   How Unwinding Works  

Unwinding is used to refer to the closing trades that require multiple steps, trades, or time. If an investor takes a long position in stocks while at the same time selling puts on the same issue, they will need to unwind those trades at some point. This entails covering the options and selling the underlying stock. A similar process would be followed by a broker attempting to correct a buying or selling error.



Unwinding is a process of reversing or closing a trade by participating in an offsetting transaction.


   Closing a Position  

Closing a position is the process required to eliminate a particular investment from a portfolio. In the case of securities, when an investor wants to close the position, the most common action is to sell the security. In the case of shorts, an investor would need to buy the short shares back to close the position. The term unwinding is more likely to be used when buying or selling occurs over multiple transactions, and not just one. Unwinding is a process.


   Unwinding to Correct Trade Errors  

If a broker accidentally performs an incorrect action with an investor's funds, such as buying more of a particular security when the instruction was to sell it, the broker must resell the security that was accidentally purchased to correct the error. They must then make the original sale requested. If the broker experiences a loss during this error correction process, the broker is responsible for the difference, not the investor.



Other activities that can be considered a trade error include buying or selling a security other than the one specified, buying or selling the incorrect quantity of a security, or trading in prohibited securities. Errors that are caught prior to being fully processed, and that are successfully canceled, do not require unwinding.


   Unwinding and Liquidity Risk  

Liquidity risk can have negative effects on an investor's or a broker's ability to unwind a transaction. Liquidity refers to the ease at which a particular asset can be bought or sold. If an asset is less liquid, it is more challenging to find an appropriate buyer or seller, so the liquidity risk is elevated. Regardless of whether a transaction was completed intentionally or accidentally, all risks associated with the particular security still apply when attempting to unwind it.
What Is an Up-and-In Option?  

Up-and-in options are a type of exotic option that is often made available through specialized brokers to high-end clients in the over-the-counter (OTC) markets. The option features both a strike price and a barrier level. As the name suggests, the buyer of the option will benefit once the price of the underlying rises high enough to reach (knock-in) the designated barrier price level. Otherwise, the option will expire worthless.





Key Takeaways

These are exotic options usually available to institutional investors on stocks or forex.These options have both a strike price and a barrier level specified.An up-and-in option pays out when the underlying reaches the barrier price level before expiration.

   How an Up-and-In Option Works  

Up-and-in options are a type of exotic option known as a barrier option. As an exotic option, barrier options are structured with more complex terms than standard plain vanilla options. Barrier options can be of two varieties, either a knock-in option or a knock-out option. The option pays out differently depending on the variety. Barrier options may also include a rebate provision for the holder if the option cannot be exercised.



Because exotic options are often available in OTC markets, there is a fair amount of variation in how these options may be offered. Depending on the liquidity of the underlying, which may be forex or stocks, some options may be offered in a bespoke manner. These kinds of options are also rarely available to most retail investors. Here is how the payouts vary between the two varieties.


   Knock-In Options  

Knock-in options can be either up-and-in or down-and-in. This implies whether the price will rise or fall to meet the barrier price level. The barrier price, when crossed, makes the option available for exercise. An up-and-in option will give the holder the right to exercise when the barrier price level is reached or exceeded, depending on the structuring.



In a down-and-in option, the holder gets the right to exercise when the underlying asset’s price falls to, or below, a certain barrier level. Barrier options are structured with either puts or calls. An up-and-in call option allows an investor to benefit when a price is rising. A down-and-in uses a put option and allows an investor to benefit when a price is falling.


   Knock-Out Options  

Knock-out options are the opposite of knock-in options. These products make the option defective when a price is reached, but viable so long as the barrier price is not reached. Knock-out options can be either up-and-out or down-and-out. With an up-and-out option, the product becomes defective when a price is reached or exceeded, and with a down-and-out option, the product becomes defective when a price falls to or below its barrier level.


   Rebate Barrier Options  

Both knock-in and knock-out options can include a rebate provision. These options will be known as rebate barrier options. In a rebate barrier option, the holder receives a rebate when the option is non-exercisable at expiration.


   Barrier Option Provisions  

Barrier options can be structured in various ways. These options are American options with a flexible exercise date. Some options may become effective or defective when a specific barrier price is reached while others require the security’s value to move through the price before their provisions are enacted.



Barrier options can also include modified touch provisions. Some barrier options may include one touch while others require multiple touches. Barrier options can also be structured to include provisions for two or more barriers.

What Is an Up-and-Out Option?  

An up-and-out option is a type of knock-out barrier option that ceases to exist when the price of the underlying security rises above a specific price level, called the barrier price.



If the price of the underlying does not rise above the barrier level, the option acts like any other option—it gives the holder the right but not the obligation to exercise their call or put option at the strike price on or before the expiration date specified in the contract.





Key Takeaways

An up-and-out option is a type of options contract that ceases to exist if the underlying moves above a certain price point, called the barrier.A down-and-out option is similar, except it ceases to exist if the price of the underlying drops below the barrier price.Up-and-out options are typically cheaper than vanilla options because there is a chance of being knocked out of the option (which makes the up-and-out option worthless).


   Understanding Up-and-Out Options  

Considered an exotic option, an up-and-out option is one of two types of knock-out barrier options. (The other type of knock-out barrier option is a down-and-out option.) Both kinds come in put and call varieties. A barrier option is a type of option where the payoff, and the very existence of the option, depends on whether or not the underlying asset reaches a predetermined price.



A knock-out will expire worthless if the underlying reaches a certain price, limiting profits for the holder and limiting losses for the writer. The critical concept for a knock-out option is that if the underlying asset reaches the barrier at any time during the option's life, the option is knocked out and will not come back into existence. It does not matter if the underlying moves back below pre-knock-out levels.



For example, an up-and-out option has a strike price of $80 and a knock-out price of $100. At the option's inception, the price of the stock was $75, but before the option was exercisable, the price of the stock reached $100. This valuation means the option automatically expires worthless because it hit or exceeded the barrier level—it does not matter where the underlying trades before the exercise date.



A barrier option can alternatively be constructed as a knock-in. In contrast to knock-outs, a knock-in option has no value until the underlying reaches a certain price.



Up-and-outs can also be compared with down-and-out options. With a down-and-out option, if the underlying falls below the barrier price, the option ceases to exist.






An up-and-out option can be a call or put. Both get knocked out if the underlying rises above the barrier price.


   Using Up-and-Out Options  

Large institutions or market markers create these options via direct agreements with clients seeking them. For example, a portfolio manager can use them as a less expensive method to hedge against losses on a short position. The hedge would be less costly than buying vanilla call options. However, it would be an imperfect hedge because the buyer would be unprotected if the security price increased above the barrier price.



Pricing still depends on all the regular options metrics—the knock-out feature adding an extra dimension. Since options trade over the counter, there is typically limited liquidity for such instruments. This means the buyer will need to accept the premium (cost) offered to them (or else attempt to negotiate a better price with the seller). Vanilla option premiums can provide a baseline estimate to work off of. Typically, an up-and-out call option should have a lower premium than a vanilla call option with the same expiration and strike.


   Example of an Up-and-Out Option  

As an example, assume that an institutional investor is interested in buying calls on Apple Inc. (AAPL) because they believe the price will rise. They need to buy 100 contracts, so they want to keep the cost as low as possible. They consider buying an up-and-out option since they tend to be cheaper than similar vanilla calls.



Say that Apple stock is trading at $200. The investor believes the price will rise above $200 over the next three months but probably won't rise above $240. They decide to buy an at-the-money up-and-out option with a strike price of $200, an expiration in three months, and a knock-out level of $240.



A vanilla option expiring in three months with a $200 strike is trading for $11.80 (or $1,180 per contract, which includes 100 shares). The investor needs to buy 100 contracts, for a total cost of $118,000.



They have received a quote that an investment bank will offer them the up-and-out for $8.80, for a total cost of $88,000 ($8.80 x 100 shares x 100 contracts). This saves the firm $30,000 on premium costs.



The investor's breakeven is $200 plus the cost of the option ($8.80), or $208.80. Apple stock needs to move above $208.80 within the next three months in order for the investor to cover the cost of the options. They make money if the price of Apple trades above $208.80 but also remains below $240.



If, at any time before expiration, the price of Apple stock touches $240, the options cease to exist and the investor loses the premium they paid ($88,000).
What Is Up/Down Gap Side-by-Side White Lines?  

The up/down gap side-by-side white lines is a three-candle continuation pattern that occurs on candlestick charts.





Key Takeaways

The up/down gap side-by-side white lines is a three-candle continuation pattern that occurs on candlestick charts.The up version is a white candle followed by a gap up and two white candles of similar size.The down version is a black candle followed by a gap down and two white candles of similar size.The pattern is a continuation pattern, meaning the price is expected to move in the direction of the trend (first candle), following the pattern.The pattern has moderate reliability in terms of the trend continuing after the pattern, but quite often the price move after the pattern will be muted, indicating it is not a highly significant pattern.


   Understanding Up/Down Gap Side-by-Side White Lines  

The up version is a large up (white or green) candle followed by a gap and then two more white candles of similar size to each other. The down version is a large down (black or red) candle followed by two white candles of similar size. When the pattern occurs, which is rare, it is expected that the price will continue moving in the current trend direction—down or up, as the case may be.



The up gap side-by-side white lines is a bullish continuation pattern with the following characteristics:



The market is in an uptrend.
The first candle is a white candle.
The second candle opens above the close of the first candle (gap up).
The third candle has a real body with the same length as the second candle with an open that's at the same level or higher than the real body of the first candle.



The down gap side-by-side white lines is a bearish continuation pattern with the following characteristics:



The market is in a downtrend.
The first candle is a black candle.
The second candle is a white candle that opens below the close of the first candle (gap down).
The third candle is a white candle with a real body that's the same length as the second candle and opens at the same level or lower than the real body of the first candle.



The side-by-side white lines pattern is moderately accurate in predicting a continuation of the current trend, but it is somewhat uncommon. A continuation occurs 66% of the time. The pattern doesn't always produce large price moves. A little over 60% of the patterns produced a 6% average move in 10 days, and those patterns occurred in downtrends with a downside breakout from the pattern (downtrend continuation). Patterns occurring in other contexts didn't have price moves as large, according to Thomas Bulkowski's candlestick research.



Other chart patterns or technical indicators should be used to confirm the candlestick pattern to maximize the odds of success.



Many traders opt to wait for confirmation from the pattern. Confirmation is price movement that confirms the expectation of the pattern. For example, following an up gap side-by-side white lines pattern, a trader may wait for the price to move above the highs of the pattern before initiating a long position. A stop loss could then be placed below the low of the second or third candle or even the first candle in order to give the trade more room.



The difference between up/down gap side-by-side white lines and a three outside up/down candlestick pattern is that, unlike the former pattern, the latter is a reversal pattern, not a continuation pattern. In the outside up pattern, a black candlestick is followed by two white candles. In the outside down pattern, a white candle is followed by two black candles.


   Up/Down Gap Side-by-Side White Lines Psychology  

Up — Suppose the security is engaged in an uptrend, with confident bulls expecting higher prices. The first candle shows a rally with a large real body and a close higher than the open. Bull confidence increases further on the second candle, with an up gap and positive intraday price action that holds a higher high into the closing bell. Bullish resolve is tested on the third candle, which opens with an initial drop into the opening price of the second candle. However, the decline fails to gain traction and buyers lift the security back to the high of the second candle by the close. This reveals diminishing bear power, raising odds for a rally and new high on the next candle.  
Down — Suppose the security is engaged in a downtrend, with confident bears expecting lower prices. The first candle posts a sell-off bar with a large real body and a close lower than the open. Bear confidence is shaken on the second candle, with a down gap and strong intraday price action that holds below the gap into the closing bell. Bearish resolve grows on the third candle, which opens with a down gap into the opening price of the second candle. Once again strong intraday price action fails to pierce gap resistance. This reveals diminishing bull power, raising odds for a decline and new low on the next candle.


   Up Gap Side-by-Side White Lines Example  

The Apple Inc. (AAPL) daily chart shows an example of the up gap version of the candlestick pattern.

Coming off a swing low, the price has a large up candle followed by a gap and then two additional side-by-side up candles. The next day (fourth candle), the price continued to rally, moving above the high of candles two and three. This provided confirmation that the uptrend was continuing. The rally lasted a few more days before drifting sideways.


   Up/Down Gap Side by Side White Lines Limitations  

The pattern is rare, which means finding it and opportunities to use it will be limited.
The pattern has moderate reliability, which means that ideally the candlestick pattern should be coupled with other forms of analysis and confirmed by other trade signals.
Following the pattern, the pattern that tended to produce large price moves was the down gap version occurring in a downtrend.
The pattern served to act as a downtrend continuation pattern.
This pattern, and candlestick patterns in general, don't provide a price target. It is up to the trader to determine when they will exit a profitable trade. Waiting for price confirmation following the pattern is recommended.

What Is Up-Front Mortgage Insurance (UFMI)?  

Up-front mortgage insurance is an insurance premium that is collected, typically on Federal Housing Administration (FHA) loans, at the time the loan is initially made.



Though similar, it is not quite the same as private mortgage insurance (PMI), which is collected by a conventional private mortgage lender each month when a buyer's down payment on a home is less than 20% of the purchase price. Up-front mortgage premiums are added to a pool of money that is used to help entities, such as the FHA, insure loans for certain borrowers.





Key Takeaways

Up-front mortgage insurance (UFMI) is an additional insurance premium of 1.75% that is collected on Federal Housing Administration (FHA) loans.This insurance money protects the lender in case the borrower defaults on his mortgage payments.UFMI can be paid at the time the loan closes or rolled into the mortgage payments. It is in addition to ongoing mortgage insurance premium payments.


   Understanding Up-Front Mortgage Insurance (UFMI)  

Like PMI, the purpose of FHA mortgage insurance is to protect the lender. When borrowers have minimal equity in their homes, the risk (to the lender) that the borrower will default is higher, because the borrower doesn't have as much to lose by walking away and letting the bank foreclose. With mortgage insurance, if you stop making your mortgage payments and walk away from your home, the insurer will help your lender recoup its losses.



FHA loans have lower down-payment requirements—as low as 3.5% of a home's price tag— and less stringent income and credit requirements than conventional loans. So these loans require the payment of up-front mortgage insurance, which is collected at the time of closing.



Since 2015, the rate for up-front mortgage insurance has been 1.75% of the base loan price. FHA Streamline refinance loans are charged a UFMIP of 0.55%. You have the option to pay this amount in cash when you close your loan, but most people choose to roll it into their total mortgage amount.






If you can afford to pay the amount of up-front mortgage insurance (UFMI) at the outset, it's a good idea to do so. If you decide to roll it into your loan, it will be a lot more expensive in the long run.



In addition to the UFMI, borrowers have to pay ongoing mortgage insurance premiums (MIP), which range from 0.45% to 1.05% of the total mortgage. You'll have to pay this mortgage insurance until your loan-to-value ratio is low enough—that is, until you have paid off a certain amount of your mortgage. When your equity is high enough (in the case of an FHA loan, the percentage is 22%), there is less risk for the lender should you walk away from the loan. At this time, the insurance is no longer required. Those with loans greater than 15 years are required to make monthly mortgage insurance payments for five years. If your mortgage is shorter than 15 years, then the only requirement is the 78% loan-to-value ratio.



Up-front mortgage insurance premium payments are submitted directly to the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and collected by the U.S. Department of the Treasury's automated collection service. They go into an escrow account.



HUD uses a secure Internet collection portal to process collections electronically. This automated collection service:



Satisfies agency and business partner demands for electronic alternatives by providing the ability to complete forms, make payments, and submit queries electronically via the Internet.Enables business partners and consumer users to access their payment accounts from any computer with Internet access.Enables federal agencies to obtain and process collections in an efficient and timely manner


   Special Considerations  

Many people do not realize that premiums for up-front mortgage insurance can usually be refunded on a pro-rated basis if they paid it all at once, and then sell their home within the first five to seven years of ownership. In other words, they may be entitled to a substantial refund even years after the fact.



If a homeowner received their FHA loan before June 2013, they are eligible for a refund and cancelation of their up-front mortgage insurance premium after five years. A homeowner must have 22% equity in the property, and all payments must have been made on time. Homeowners with FHA loans issued after June 2013 must refinance into a conventional loan and have a current loan-to-value of at 80% or more.


  Tips to Avoid Paying Up-Front Mortgage Insurance (UFMI)  

There are a few ways home buyers can avoid paying upfront mortgage insurance:



Apply for a conventional mortgage loan. Mortgage lenders will not require upfront mortgage insurance for conventional loans that have an 80% loan to value or less. This threshold applies to both original home purchases and refinancing.Make a 20% down payment. A mortgage lender will not shoulder as much risk when a down payment for a home is equal to 20% or more; therefore, a homebuyer is not expected to pay for mortgage insurance.Get a second mortgage. A 5% down payment would require a 15% second mortgage, and a 10% down payment would require a 10% second mortgage, to account for the 20% that is needed to avoid mortgage insurance.Get help from the seller. A seller who has equity may opt to finance a portion of the purchase price, via a second mortgage. Your 10% down payment that is coupled with the seller’s 10% second mortgage will help you avoid mortgage insurance.




Is UFMI Refundable?
The Upfront Mortgage Insurance (USMI) premium is not refundable, except when in connection with refinancing to a new FHA-insured mortgage within three years of the original loan.




How Is the FHA UFMI Premium Calculated?
The UFMI premium the FHA requires on a mortgage is 1.75% of the loan amount. So, if the initial loan is $200,000, 1.75% of that amount would be $3,500. The mortgage amount would thus become $203,500 with the UFMI premium included.




Can the UFMI Be Paid in Cash, or Can It Be Financed Into the Loan Payments?
The UFMI premium can be paid either in cash or financed into the loan, but must be entirely paid in one way the other, not split. Any UFMIP amounts paid in cash are added to the total cash settlement requirements.
What Is the Up-Market Capture Ratio?  

The up-market capture ratio is the statistical measure of an investment manager's overall performance in up-markets. It is used to evaluate how well an investment manager performed relative to an index during periods when that index has risen.



The up-market capture ratio can be compared with the down-market capture ratio. In practice, both measures are used in tandem.





Key Takeaways

The up-market capture ratio measures an investment manager's relative performance during bull markets.The ratio is calculated by comparing the manager's returns in up-markets with that of a benchmark index.Investors and analysts should consider both the up- and down-market capture ratios together to understand a manager's overall performance.


   Calculating the Up-Market Capture Ratio  

The up-market capture ratio is calculated by dividing the manager's returns by the returns of the index during the up-market and multiplying that factor by 100.

   Understanding the Up-Market Capture Ratio  

An investment manager who has an up-market ratio greater than 100 has outperformed the index during the up-market. For example, an up-market capture ratio of 120 indicates that the manager outperformed the market by 20% during the specified period. Many analysts use this simple calculation in their broader assessments of individual investment managers.



If an investment mandate calls for an investment manager to meet or exceed a benchmark index’s rate of return, the up-market capture ratio is helpful for spotting those managers who are doing so. This is important to investors who use an active investment strategy and consider relative returns, rather than absolute returns (as hedge funds often seek).


   Special Considerations  

The up-market capture ratio is just one of many indicators used by analysts to find good money managers. Because the ratio focuses on upside movements and doesn’t account for downside (losses) moves, some critics offer compelling evidence that it encourages managers to “shoot for the moon.” But when combined with complementary performance indicators, the up-market capture ratio does present valuable investment insight.



When evaluating an investment manager, it is best to consider the down-market capture ratio, too. This ratio is calculated in the same way except using down-market returns. Once both measures are known, a comparison may reveal that a manager with a large down-market ratio or poor up-market ratio still outperforms the market.






The market capture ratios of passive index funds should be very close to 100%.


   Example of How to Use the Up-Market Capture Ratio  

If the down-market ratio is 110 but the up-market ratio is 140, then the manager has been able to compensate for the poor down-market performance with strong up-market performance.



You can quantify this by dividing the up-market ratio by the down-market ratio to get the overall capture ratio. In our example, dividing 140 by 110 gives an overall capture ratio of 1.27, indicating the up-market performance more than offsets the down-market performance.



The same is true if the manager performs better in down-markets than up-markets. If the up-market ratio is only 90 but the down-market ratio is 70, then the overall capture ratio is 1.29, indicating that the manager is outperforming the market overall.
What Is Up Volume?  

"Up volume" generally refers to an increase in the volume of shares traded in either a market or security that leads to an increase in value. Up volume can be contrasted with down volume.





Key Takeaways

Up volume is the circumstance where the rising price of a security is accompanied by high or increased trading.Up volume may indicate a shift in trend toward a rally or bull market.Positive volume indexes help keep track of up volume to confirm that a rise in price may indeed signal a longer-term shift in sentiment.


   Understanding Up Volume  

Up volume occurs in bullish markets when security prices are rising with increased volume in the market. Up volume may also be referred to as up on volume. Overall, volume can be influenced by a number of factors and may have various effects.



On an up volume trading day, an index’s value would trade higher in conjunction with an increase in its trading volume. The same concept occurs in a single security. For example, an up volume stock day for a single stock would show a price trading higher and ultimately closing higher than the previous day’s close.



Volume is the total number of shares that are transacted. Volume can be influenced by a number of factors and is typically higher following the release of public information about a security.



Noise traders tend to be significant contributors to high-volume trades. For example, a company's stock may be rising on a release of good news. If the news was unanticipated it can boost trading from both institutional and retail investors as the price gains. Noise traders will contribute to high-volume trading days since they follow trends and trade heavily on sentiment.



Most technical analysts and institutional investors, when watching a stock for possible investment, will follow its volume. A spike in volume is typically caused by a significant market catalyst that merits attention. Many technical analysts believe that volume can also be a signal of a price breakout in a bullish or bearish direction.


   PVI and NVI  

The Positive and Negative Volume Indexes (PVI and NVI) were first developed by Paul Dysart in the 1930s to help investors discern some of the effects of market trading volume. PVI and NVI then became more popular in the 1970s after the calculations were expanded to individual securities.



PVI: If current volume is greater than the previous day's volume, PVI = Previous PVI + {[(Today's Closing Price-Yesterday's Closing Price)/Yesterday's Closing Price)] x Previous PVI}. If current volume is lower than the previous day's volume, PVI is unchanged.



NVI: If current volume is less than the previous day’s volume, NVI = Previous NVI + {[(Today's Closing Price-Yesterday's Closing Price)/Yesterday's Closing Price)] x Previous NVI}. If current volume is higher than the previous day's volume, NVI is unchanged.



These index values provide insight on how prices are fluctuating with trading volume. In an up volume trend, PVI would trend higher as volume increased. Thus, investors seeking to profit on bullish up volume trading could use the PVI as one indicator for potential price signals.
What Is Upfront Pricing?  

Upfront pricing refers to the interest rates, fees, and certain other terms in a credit card issuer's initial agreement with a cardholder. In the United States, credit card issuers are required by law to make these disclosures and also subject to regulations governing when and how they can change the terms of the agreement.





Key Takeaways

Upfront pricing refers to the interest rates and credit limits for a particular credit card.Upfront pricing is based on the applicant's creditworthiness, as determined through a process called underwriting.Since the implementation of the federal Card Act of 2009, issuers are restricted in how often they can change their terms and for what reasons.


   How Upfront Pricing Works  

Credit card issuers set interest rates, fees, and credit limits for each cardholder through a largely automated process called underwriting.



Underwriting attempts to assess how much risk a card applicant poses, based on their credit score, their debt-to-income ratio, and other factors. A typical credit card might come with a range of possible interest rates, with riskier customers assigned rates toward the high end and less risky ones paying lower rates. Some applicants may be rejected altogether for a particular card based on the underwriting process. This is often referred to as a risk-based pricing model, and it is used not only with credit cards but with other types of lending, such as car loans and home mortgages.



Under the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, card issuers are prohibited from considering an applicant's age, gender identity, sexual orientation, marital status, race, color, religion, or national origin in deciding whether to grant them credit and in setting the terms for it.


   Upfront Pricing and Consumer Protections  

Since the passage of the Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure Act of 2009, also known as the CARD Act, credit card issuers in the U.S. have had to follow a more uniform set of rules. The act's stated goal was to "establish fair and transparent practices related to the extension of credit," and it laid out a number of provisions covering both the underwriting process and pricing.



For example, credit card issuers once had a relatively free hand in raising the interest rates they'd initially established when a cardholder opened their account, often resorting to such tactics as "hair-trigger repricing" that allowed them to impose a higher, penalty APR on the account balance if the cardholder was even a day late with their monthly payment. In fact, cardholders could even be subject to a penalty interest rate if they were late on an entirely different credit account, a situation known as universal default.



The Card Act largely reined that in. "Prior to enactment of the CARD Act," the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau has noted, "the ability of issuers to reprice existing accounts and balances allowed issuers to 'correct' pricing if their initial assessment of risk proved incorrect. At the same time, because issuers were free to reprice it was not necessary to set interest rates based upon the issuers' upfront assessment of risk."



For example, under the CARD Act, issuers generally can't change the interest rate on a card during the first year that the account is open, except in certain limited circumstances, such as a rise in the index that a variable rate card is coupled to or the end of a low- or no-interest promotional period. They must generally provide 45 days notice if they intend to change the interest rate on future transactions and can only raise the rate on existing balances if the cardholder has missed two consecutive monthly payments, and again they must provide 45 days notice. In theory, at least, the 45-day period gives the cardholder some time to shop around for a card with better terms.



As a result of these changes, consumers can count on a card issuer's upfront pricing to provide a more accurate picture of how much the card will cost them, at least for a longer period of time than before. And credit card issuers have to be more conscientious in their underwriting practices, since current laws make it more difficult to attempt a do-over if they find they misjudged an applicant's credit risk.




Can a Credit Card Issuer Change Your Credit Limit?
Yes, credit card issuers have a lot of flexibility in raising or lowering the credit limit on a customer's card. If they decide to lower it, they are generally required to provide the cardholder with a notice of adverse action. According to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, "This notice should either provide specific reasons for the action taken or allow you to request a statement of specific reasons." The credit card issuer might also decide to raise your credit limit after a period of time if you've proven to be a good customer. This can happen automatically, as issuers periodically review their existing accounts.You can also request a higher credit limit on your own, sometimes simply by filling out an online form. You're most likely to be approved by the issuer if you've consistently paid your bills on time and your income or credit score has risen since you first applied for the card.




Are Credit Card Application Fees Regulated by Law?
Yes, according to the Federal Reserve Board, "application fees cannot total more than 25% of the initial credit limit. For example, if your initial credit limit is $500, the fees for the first year cannot be more than $125." This limit also applies to annual credit card fees.




Where Can You See Your Credit Card Agreement?
If you've lost track of the credit card agreement you received, you can get another copy by contacting your card issuer, which is required by law to provide you with one on request.


   The Bottom Line  

Upfront pricing tells you the interest rate and fees you'll have to pay to use a particular credit card. Those terms can change over time, but the law requires that the card issuer give you adequate advance notice to avoid unpleasant surprises.
What Is an Upgrade?  

An upgrade refers to the positive change in an analyst's outlook of a particular security's valuation based primarily on that security's improving fundamentals.





Key Takeaways

An upgrade refers to the positive change in an analyst's outlook of a particular security's valuation based primarily on that security's improving fundamentals.An upgrade to a specific security is usually triggered by qualitative and quantitative information that contributes to an increase in the financial valuation of that security.The biggest benefit of an upgrade is that it lowers a company's cost of capital, for both debt and equity.


   Understanding an Upgrade  

An upgrade to a specific security assigns it a higher ranking and is usually triggered by qualitative and quantitative information that contributes to an increase in the financial valuation of that security. In the context of portfolio management, the term "upgrade" also refers to a strategy whereby the risk profile and quality of the portfolio are improved by including blue chips in it while eliminating speculative stocks.



Upgrades to investment ratings for stocks and fixed-income securities are issued by equity and bond analysts at their respective brokerage houses. Upgrades to the credit rating of corporate issuers of debt securities are issued by rating agencies, such as Standard & Poor's.



For example, a rating agency may upgrade the credit rating of an issuer from AA+ to AAA. Such a move would have a positive effect on all outstanding bonds and other fixed-income instruments of the issuer.


   Example of an Equity Upgrade  

An example of an equity upgrade would be an analyst raising the investment rating for a particular stock (or sector) to "buy" from "hold." An upgrade of this nature would sometimes be accompanied by an upward revision in the analyst's target price for the stock.



For equity and debt securities, an upgrade generally leads to positive press. Behind the scenes, the biggest benefit to an upgrade is a lower cost of capital, for both debt and equity. A lower cost of capital translates into a lower discount rate, which leads to a higher valuation and firm valuation.



Similar to how an individual might be able to borrow at a cheaper interest rate after a credit score "upgrade," businesses can access the capital markets more often and at cheaper rates after a positive upgrade event.



Beyond an outright upgrade event, credit rating agencies and equity valuation shops both publish watchlist or similar lists indicating securities or companies prime for an upgrade (or downgrade). Investors and creditors alike keep a close eye on potential directional changes to a security or business prospect.
What Is Uphold?  

The term Uphold refers to a cloud-based financial service platform. The service enables individuals to securely move, convert, hold, and transact in various assets, including fiat currencies, cryptocurrencies, equities, and precious metals. Users can fund their accounts from credit or debit cards, bank accounts, or cryptocurrency networks. They can also easily move funds from one form of value to another. Uphold is meant to reduce the transaction costs and fees associated with currency exchange.





Key Takeaways

Uphold is a cloud-based financial service platform.The company allows individuals to securely move, convert, hold and transact across various asset classes.Although it is commonly associated with Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, Uphold is also used to trade traditional assets such as fiat currencies, gold, and certain equities.Among Uphold’s stated priorities are the reduction of transaction fees and the maintenance of high standards of transparency.Uphold requires personal details like your name, phone number, and date of birth to set up an account and additional information if you want to make trades.


   How Uphold Works  

Uphold is "a digital money platform offering financial services to a global market." It was founded in 2014 by Halsey Minor and officially launched the following year. Originally named Bitreserve, the platform was rebranded as Uphold. The company says it's not a bank. Rather, it credits itself as being "the world’s first and only real-time transparent and fully verifiable reserve."



Uphold offers 40 equities, 27 fiat currencies, four types of precious metals, and more than 130 cryptocurrencies. Users can send funds to other people and trade over multiple assets from one screen. They can also move funds from one form of value to another in one easy step. For example, users can go from DASH to XRP in one step. On some other platforms, this trade would involve two separate transactions and two separate fees.



The stated goal is to reduce the transaction costs involved in exchanging money, particularly for cryptocurrencies, such as bitcoin. In the earliest years of cryptocurrencies, those wishing to hold and trade in the currency often faced a steep learning curve. Unlike traditional currencies whose infrastructure developed slowly over centuries, cryptocurrency enthusiasts and entrepreneurs needed to develop their own infrastructure from scratch.



The company has similar initiatives to reduce transaction fees. It claims that it is less expensive on average than other household-name cryptocurrency platforms Indeed, the company has moved to commission-free pricing. The price that users see before they trade is the price they pay when they trade.






Third-party developers are able to develop additional software offerings based on the Uphold platform. This is made possible through Uphold Connect, the company’s application programming interface (API).


   Uphold Exchange Fees  

Many cryptocurrency traders share a desire to increase the transparency of these financial platforms. Uphold was inspired in part by the lack of financial transparency revealed by the 2007-2008 financial crisis. One practical example of this commitment is that Uphold publishes its reserve status in real-time, showing the individual asset and liability balances for its tier 1, tier 2, and tier 3 reserves. The company is audited quarterly to verify solvency.



For cryptocurrencies, Uphold offers an all-inclusive, guaranteed price that includes a small spread of typically 50 to 100 bps (0.5% to 1.0%). Depending on your individual trading behavior and volumes, the spread can be as low as 40 bps (0.4%). The company also offers free debit and credit card deposits, and zero withdrawal fees with the exception of standard network fees on cryptocurrency networks.



In March 2018, Uphold added the cryptocurrency Ripple (XRP) to its platform, offering Uphold members zero transaction fees on the first five million XRP purchased. This move represented a bold entry into the XRP marketplace, as Coinbase—one of the world’s largest digital currency exchanges—did not support XRP at that time.






Uphold operates on a fully reserved basis. This means its obligations are fully backed by the assets it holds in reserve. By contrast, the standard practice among modern banks is the so-called fractional reserve model, in which banks often retain only a small percentage of the assets given to them by depositors. Those assets that are not retained by the bank are instead lent out to customers or invested in order to obtain a higher return.


   Requirements for Uphold  

When users sign up for Uphold, they are asked to provide the following personal information:



Legal nameDate of birthPhone number

   Advantages and Disadvantages of Uphold  

Just like any other platform, individuals must consider the benefits and drawbacks of using Uphold. We've listed some of the most common ones below.


  Advantages  

Uphold users can make trades, exchanges, and transfers across multiple asset classes. And the service allows users to convert from one asset class to another. This includes traditional currencies, precious metals, cryptocurrencies, and equities.



The company is very transparent about its fee structure. This means there are no surprises about how much Uphold charges for using the platform and how much it charges per transaction. As noted above, Uphold's all-inclusive price comes with a small spread between 0.5% to 1.0% but it can be as low as 0.4%.


  Disadvantages  

Although Uphold offers its users a variety of asset classes, there are limitations to the number in each category. As of July 2022, Uphold allows users to trade four different precious metals and 40 different equities, including major names like Tesla, Apple, Cisco, Proctor & Gamble, and Home Depot.



Unlike other digital platforms, users won't find any advanced features on Uphold. This includes things like charts, research, and other tools that many savvy traders are used to using as part of their daily activities.





Pros

Buy and sell across multiple asset classes
Transparent fee structure



Cons

Limited options in asset classes
Lack of trading tools





   Uphold vs. Coinbase  

Coinbase is another well-known financial platform. Unlike Uphold, Coinbase only allows users to buy, sell, trade, and hold cryptocurrencies—not different asset classes. It was founded in 2012 as a way to trade Bitcoin and now supports multiple digital currencies, including Ethereum and Dogecoin.



Users can choose between Coinbase and Coinbase Pro. The former provides a user-friendly experience for those who are just starting out while the latter offers more advanced features as well as a higher number of trades and trade types like limit and stop orders.



Uphold is very transparent about its fee structure. Coinbase users, on the other hand, can't access a fee schedule on the company's website for the simple service. And there are significant differences between the two platforms. While trading using a bank account is free for Uphold users, Coinbase charges 1.49%. Trading fees on Coinbase are based on the size of the trade so trades of $10 or less incur a $0.99 fee while those between $50 to $200 incur a $2.99 fee. Coinbase Pro does offer a fee schedule on its website.




Where Is Uphold Located?
Uphold is a digital financial platform that allows individuals to trade and transfer various assets, including currencies, precious metals, and cryptocurrencies. The company is based in New York.




Is Uphold a Wallet or an Exchange?
Uphold is a multi-asset exchange—not just a digital wallet. As such, it is a platform that allows users to exchange and transfer fiat currencies, precious metals, cryptocurrencies, and certain stocks.




Is Uphold Safe?
Uphold is a safe trading platform to use. The company has industry standard checks and balances in place, including Know Your Client (KYC) verification. It also uses two-factor authentication. Other security measures include third-party due diligence, a bug bounty program, staff background checks, and routine auditing and system testing.




Does Uphold Report to the IRS?
Uphold adheres to regulatory and reporting requirements, which means that the company does report all taxable transactions to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). Users are asked for their Social Security numbers (SSNs). The company makes the relevant 1099 forms available to its clients on its app.


   The Bottom Line  

Individual traders who want to make trades and exchanges across multiple asset classes may want to consider Uphold. The company gives its users access to more than two dozen traditional currencies, 40 equities, precious metals, and more than 130 different cryptocurrencies. And the list continues to grow. Among the other benefits of using this platform include full transparency about its fee structure and the ease with which you can conduct your trades. And if you want to make sure that your money is safe, Uphold promises to stay on top.
What Is the Upper Class?  

The term upper class refers to a group of individuals who occupy the highest place and status in society. These people are considered the wealthiest, lying above the working and middle class in the social hierarchy. Individuals who make up the upper class have higher levels of disposable income and exert more control over the use of natural resources. While the upper class makes up a small percentage of the overall population, it controls a disproportionately large amount of the overall wealth.





Key Takeaways

   Understanding Upper Class  

The term upper class is a socioeconomic term used to describe those who reside on the highest levels of the social ladder above the middle and working or lower classes. They generally have the highest status in society and hold a great deal of wealth. Because of this, they also carry a considerable amount of power—politically, economically, and financially.






Members of the upper class carry a considerable amount of power—politically, economically, and financially.



This class was historically dominated by land-owning nobility and aristocrats. People who fell into these groups didn't have to work for a living. Instead, they inherited their money or lived off their investments. Because this group was primarily composed of large, wealthy families, those who didn't belong—including anyone who managed to amass a considerable amount of wealth—were barred from calling themselves members of the upper class.



The definition of the term has changed over time to include a wider range of people. Today, celebrities, politicians, investors, and other wealthy individuals fall into this group. In the United States, those who lived—and continue to live—in leadership roles in society are often considered part of the upper class. These are people whose status has been passed down through generations.



According to a 2018 study by Pew Research Center, 19% of American adults were part of upper-class households. These families earned a median income of $187,872 in 2016, compared to 52% who made up the middle class and 29% who made up the lower class. The wealth held by these individuals has led to a disparate gap in income and power over those in other classes.



While those in the upper class exert significant control over economic and political developments, most production activities and consumption are done by the working and middle classes. The working and middle classes handle most of the economic production and consumption because they are much larger in number than the small upper class and require a more significant percentage of the resources.


   The Upper Class vs. Other Classes  

As mentioned above, income and power generally separate the upper class from the other classes. The middle-class generally describes households with people who fall between the upper and working or lower class. The parameters of the middle-class are fairly fluid. Its application to income, education, and social status varies based on location and other factors. Many people who make up the middle-class work as professionals and civil servants, and own property.



The working or lower class refers to those who make up the lowest level of society. These individuals often work in low-paying, blue-collar jobs that require physical labor and limited skill. Working or lower class individuals earn much less than the upper and middle class and hold very little power in society.



In a frontier or emerging economy, there are often only two classes—the working class, or poor, and the upper class, or elite. As an economy develops and better jobs and infrastructure create more wealth, a middle class emerges. The newly emerged middle class starts to have more disposable income, which further advances the economy.



Eventually, a divide within the middle class emerges and separates the average middle class from those who have significantly more disposable income but aren't yet considered rich. These are the upper-middle-class people. The upper-middle-class usually evolves out of people from the middle-class tier who are particularly resourceful or who achieve higher levels of education than the rest of the middle class. Examples of these people in today's society are doctors and lawyers. Although they are not Bill Gates, they do make more money than teachers.
What Is Upper Management?  

Upper management includes individuals and teams that are responsible for making the primary decisions within a company.





Key Takeaways

Upper management includes individuals and teams that are responsible for making the primary decisions within a company.Shareholders hold a company's upper management responsible for keeping a company profitable and growing.C-level management positions include the most important upper managers including CEO and CFO, among others.


   Understanding Upper Management  

Personnel considered to be part of a company's upper management are at the top of the corporate ladder and carry a degree of responsibility greater than lower-level personnel. Upper management members are imbued with powers given by the company's shareholders or board of directors. Examples of upper management personnel include CEOs, CFOs, and COOs.



Shareholders hold a company's upper management responsible for keeping a company profitable and growing. Shareholders do this by exercising their voting power to install boards of directors that will fire underperforming or otherwise disapproved managers. Because upper management personnel members are often not seen by most employees, they are not expected to engage in day-to-day operations.



The duties, responsibilities, and careers of upper management are often tied directly to the performance and success of a company. Whereas employees typically are measured against daily goals, such as the flow of the sales at their retail location or the number of customers they served, upper management may face a wholly different degree of criteria.



The overall sales across a division or regional market may be used to gauge the job performance of the executive in upper management who oversees said division.



For instance, a scientist or other researcher working for a drug company can be expected to take a direct, hands-on role in the development of new drug candidates. They will conduct the tests and reformulations to advance the potential product towards submission to regulators. A middle manager might lead their team working on the project, but an executive from upper management will have the prevailing authority on the direction the team takes and bear responsibility for how their efforts affect the company as a whole. If the drug development is a success and furthers the company’s strategic plans, the executive who heads the division may be assigned similar projects in the future.



If a company performs below its targeted goals, loses traction compared to its rivals, or its market valuation declines, members of upper management may face the most immediate scrutiny from shareholders. Persistent poor performance of the company could prompt a shakeup of the upper management. This may be focused on one or more individuals such as the CEO or could be a sweeping removal of the executive leadership. The removal of upper management may be done to salvage a company’s business and operations and introduce a new direction to follow. A new upper management team might be brought in to correct the course of the company and prepare it to pursue a new direction, which may include a sale of the business.


   C-Suite Roles  

C-suite, or C-level, is widely-used vernacular describing a cluster of a corporation's most important senior executives. C-suite gets its name from the titles of top senior staffers, which tend to start with the letter C, for "chief", as in chief executive officer (CEO), chief financial officer (CFO), chief operating officer (COO), and chief information officer (CIO). The main C-suite executives are:



Chief Executive Officer (CEO): Invariably the highest-level corporate executive, the CEO traditionally serves as the face of the company, and frequently consults other C-suite members for advice on major decisions. CEOs can come from any career background, as long as they have cultivated substantial leadership and decision-making skills along their career paths.
Chief Financial Officer (CFO): In the financial industry, the CFO position represents the top of the corporate ladder for financial analysts and accountants striving for upward mobility. Portfolio management, accounting, investment research, and financial analysis are prime skills that CFOs must have learned over the years. CFOs have global mindsets and work closely with CEOs to source new business opportunities while weighing the financial risks and benefits of each potential venture.
Chief Information Officer (CIO): A leader in information technology, the CIO usually gets his or her start as a business analyst, then works towards C-level glory, while developing technical skills in disciplines such as programming, coding, project management, MS Office, and mapping. CIOs are usually skilled at applying these functional skills to risk management, business strategy, and finance activities. In many companies, CIOs are referred to as the Chief Technology Officers.
Chief Operating Officer (COO): The Human Resources (HR) C-level of executive, the COO ensures a company's operations run smoothly in areas such as recruitment, training, payroll, legal, and administrative services. The COO is usually second in command to the CEO.
Chief Marketing Officer (CMO): CMOs typically work their way up to the C-suite from sales and/or marketing roles. These execs are skilled at managing social innovation and product development initiatives across both brick-and-mortar establishments and electronic platforms - the latter of which is highly essential in today's digital era.



Other C-Suite officers include the Chief Compliance Officer (CCO), Chief Human Resources Manager (CHRM), Chief Security Officer (CSO), Chief Green Officer (CGO), Chief Analytics Officer (CAO), Chief Medical Officer (CMO), and Chief Data Officer (CDO).



The number of C-level positions varies, depending on variables such as a company's size, mission, and sector. While larger companies may require both a CHRM and a COO, smaller operations may only need a COO to oversee human resources activities.
What Is an UPREIT?  

UPREIT means umbrella partnership real estate investment trust. An UPREIT is a unique REIT structure that allows property owners to exchange their property for share ownership in the UPREIT. However, UPREITs are generally subject to Internal Revenue Code (IRC) Section 721 exchanges.





Key Takeaways

An UPREIT is a unique REIT structure that allows property owners to exchange their property for share ownership in the UPREIT.Property-for-share exchanges in an UPREIT are generally allowed under Section 721 of the Title 26 Internal Revenue Code.UPREIT property contributors can defer taxes on the sale of property in exchange for UPREIT units though capital gains taxes on UPREIT units are subject to standard REIT taxation.


   Understanding UPREITs  

Real estate investment trusts (REITs) were introduced by Dwight D. Eisenhower as a type of alternative real estate mutual fund. REITs are created as a type of real estate portfolio that includes real estate properties and real estate financing capital. REITs are an entity that allows investors to make investment contributions for equity units or shares of the business. 



As REITs have evolved in the market, some alternative structures have been developed to provide for different types of investors. The UPREIT is one such structure, primarily known for its allowance of property contributions in exchange for share ownership. The DownREIT and some other alternatives have also been created as offshoots.



In their formation, REITs can choose to take on any type of business structure. Publicly traded REITs will be structured as corporations. Private REITs will generally choose to be structured as a trust or association though they may also choose other statuses. Like most non-corporations, private entities also have the option to be taxed as a corporation.



What is primarily important for any REIT is that they meet the requirements of IRC Title 26, Sections 856-859. When meeting these requirements, a REIT can pass through all of its income to its shareholders. As such, the pass-through income is considered a deduction and the REIT pays very little in taxes. The main requirement is that greater than 90% of the business pertains to real estate assets.


   Special Considerations   

Instead of selling property, an owner can contribute it to an UPREIT in exchange for units. The share units generally have the same value as the contributed property. Since the property sold to the REIT is covered under IRC Section 721, the transaction does not create a taxable event.



In property-to-share conversion, UPREITs may dictate special provisions. Often, the exchange provides the seller with special units that allow the property seller to choose how they would like to vest in the REIT. Property sellers may be allowed to immediately convert units to REIT shares. Other options may also be available such as holding shares for a minimum of one year and then receiving cash.



Once an investor sells their property to an UPREIT, the UPREIT owns the property and all administration involved with it. UPREIT management can be somewhat more complex than basic REITs because of the Section 721 exchange option and all of the provisions that come with it for the new unitholder. UPREIT managers are responsible for managing their REIT portfolio for the purpose of generating returns. 



Shares of the UPREIT can fluctuate based on the activities of management, valuation of the real estate properties, financing deals, and any other transactions that occur. This can create volatility for shareholders. UPREIT shareholders will typically have flexible liquidity which allows them to easily convert their shares to cash whenever they choose.


   Benefits of UPREITs   

UPREITs can be a viable option for any property owner seeking to sell their property. As such, it can appeal to both individual property owners and commercial property owners. Any property owner who chooses to make a Section 721 exchange into an UPREIT can receive the value of the property in the form of UPREIT units. 



Section 721 exchanges into an UPREIT do not create a taxable event. However, unitholders are taxed based on general REIT taxation standards. Some property owners may choose to use this type of investment for estate planning because it can possibly bypass taxes altogether.


   Requirements for UPREITs  

An UPREIT is an REIT under all standard accounting and tax guidelines. UPREITs were created to allow for the contribution of property into the REIT in exchange for ownership shares. This structuring is therefore guided by the standards of IRC Section 721 which discusses tax shields for property to share exchanges. In general, any REIT which allows for Section 721 exchanges within the REIT can be considered an UPREIT.



Most REITs will focus on a specific segment of the real estate market, though the guiding standards only dictate that real estate property and associated financing must make up greater than 90% of the business. UPREITs will typically follow the same investing strategy, focusing on a targeted real estate niche.



Section 721 provides guiding standards for the release of shareholder units in exchange for property. Section 721 can be an alternative to IRC Section 1031 exchanges. Section 1031 exchanges allow a property owner to sell their property and invest the proceeds in a like-kind exchange to avoid taxes. 



Section 1031 exchanges are not allowed in UPREITs however because they require like-kind exchanges and do not allow a property to share ownership exchanges. Therefore, the Section 721 exchange into an UPREIT can be attractive. Both 721 and 1031 exchanges allow the property owner to defer taxes.


   UPREIT vs. DownREIT  

UPREITs, DownREITs, and all other special REIT entities are simply REITs at their core with special provisions that allow them some added flexibility. The DownREIT allows a property investor to enter into a joint venture with a REIT. In a DownREIT, the unit exchange is based primarily on the value of the property in the joint venture which can create better returns for the joint venture unitholder.
What Is Upside?  

Upside refers to the potential increase in value, measured in monetary or percentage terms, of an investment. Analysts commonly use either technical analysis or fundamental analysis techniques to predict the future price of an investment, particularly stock prices. A higher upside means that the stock has more value than is currently reflected in the stock price.





Key Takeaways

The upside is the potential for an investment to increase in value, as measured in terms of money or percentage.To make predictions about what direction a stock might take, analysts use fundamental analysis, which looks at how a company is structured and managed, or technical analysis, which looks at historic stock prices and other patterns.The upside is essentially the draw for an investor to invest, and the potential for upside is tied to how much risk the investor is willing to take on.


   Understanding Upside  

Upside refers to the predicted appreciation in the value of an investment and is the opposite of the downside. Arguably, the concept of upside is the motivating factor for an individual to invest. The magnitude of the upside move will depend primarily on the risk associated with that investment. The market axiom of high risk/high reward holds true when it comes to deciding whether to commit to or pass on an investment.



Typically, investors with a high tolerance for risk will choose investments with huge upside, while those that are risk-averse will opt for investments that have limited upside but will be more apt to preserve their initial investment value.



Fundamental analysis evaluates the upside price of a stock by considering the ability of the investment firm to generate sales and earnings and to make effective decisions about company assets. Companies that manage their costs well and increase their profit margins have a higher upside. Businesses can increase sales by moving into new markets or by adding a product line. Money managers that use fundamental analysis also consider how effectively a business uses assets to generate sales and profits.



Technical analysis is a method that considers the historic patterns in the price of a stock and in the trading volume of a security. Technical analysts believe that price movements are trends, and these managers use charts to determine the upside in a stock’s price. A breakout, for example, occurs when a stock price trades above a recent price trend. If a stock has been trading between $20 and $25 per share, for example, a price move to $28 is a breakout, which is an indication that the stock price has an upside above $28.






The high risk/high reward concept corresponds with the idea of upside: the higher the risk, the more the upside of an investment.


   Why Upside Matters  

Upside not only refers to an investment’s potential gains in value but is also a concept used to judge the success of a portfolio manager's performance when compared to a benchmark. For many mutual funds, the investment objective is to outperform a specific benchmark, such as the Standard & Poor's 500 indexes. The upside capture ratio indicates how much upside the mutual fund captures when compared to the benchmark.



Upside also plays a part in short selling. Short selling refers to the sale of stock that an investor does not own. In short selling, the seller must deliver borrowed securities to the buyer by the settlement date. Eventually, the short seller must buy the shares to cover the short position, and the seller’s goal is to buy back shares at a lower price. Short-sellers look for stocks that have reached their upside potential, which means the stock's potential to decline increases.
What Is the Upside/Downside Gap Three Methods?  

The Gap Three Methods is a three-bar Japanese candlestick pattern that indicates a continuation of the current trend. It is a variant of the Upside Tasuki Gap pattern, but the third candle completely closes the gap between the first two candles.





Key Takeaways

The Upside/Downside Gap Three Methods is a three-bar candlestick pattern. The Upside Gap Three Methods pattern suggests a bullish continuation of the trend.The Downside Gap Three Methods pattern suggests a bearish continuation of the trend.


   Breaking Down the Upside/Downside Gap Three Methods  

The Upside Gap Three methods is a bullish continuation pattern with the following characteristics:



The market is in an uptrend.
The first bar is a white candle with a long real body.
The second bar is a white candle with a long real body where the shadows over both candles don’t overlap.
The third bar is a black candle that has an open within the real body of the first candle and a close within the real body of the second candle.

The Downside Gap Three Methods is a bearish continuation pattern with the following characteristics:



The market is in a downtrend.
The first bar is a black candle with a long real body.
The second bar is a black candle with a long real body where the shadows over both candles don’t overlap.
The third bar is a white candle that has an open within the real body of the second candle and a close within the real body of the first candle.

The Upside/Downside Gap Three Methods is a rare but reasonably reliable pattern. When identified, traders should apply other forms of technical analysis to seek confirmation, such as price action and technical indicators.


   Upside Gap Three Methods Trader Psychology  

Suppose the market is engaged in a current uptrend. The rally continues on the first candle in a healthy session with the close well above the open, generating a wide range real body. This increases the bull's confidence, while putting bears on the defensive. Their caution is justified because the second candle opens with a gap up and healthy buying pressure that lifts the security to a new high. Profit-taking causes the third candle to close the gap between the first and second candles. The bulls assume the uptrend will resume now that the gap has filled.


   Downside Gap Three Methods Trader Psychology  

Now suppose the market is engaged in a current downtrend. The decline continues on the first candle in a weak session with the close well below the open, generating a wide range real body. This increases the bear's confidence, while putting bulls on the defensive. Their caution is justified because the second candle opens with a down gap and active selling pressure that drops the security to a new low. Short covering causes the third candle to close the gap between the first and second candles. The bears assume the downtrend will resume now that the gap has filled.


   Practical Example of Trading a Gap Three Methods Pattern  

Paul has spotted an Upside Gap Three Methods pattern on the chart of Cellectis S.A. and wants to use the formation to enter a long position in the direction of the trend and set his risk parameters. He could execute a trade at the closing price of the third candle at $16.39 and place a stop-loss order below the first candle’s low at $15.75. David may decide to take a more conservative approach and enter a buy stop order slightly above the second candle’s high at $16.95, waiting for confirmation that the uptrend has resumed. He could then use the low of the third candle at $16.27 as a stop-loss point.

What Is the Upside/Downside Ratio?  

The upside/downside ratio is a market breadth indicator that shows the relationship between the volumes of advancing and declining issues on an exchange. Investors typically use this indicator to determine the momentum of the market at any given time.



The upside/downside ratio is a variation on the advance-decline ratio (ADR),  which compares the number, and not the trading volume, of stocks that closed higher against the number of stocks that closed lower than their previous day's closing prices. 





Key Takeaways

The upside/downside ratio is the volume traded in advancing vs. declining issues on a given trading day.On a standalone basis, the upside/downside ratio may reveal whether the market is overbought or oversold. Looking at the trend of the upside/downside ratio can reveal whether the market is in a bullish or bearish trend.

   Understanding the Upside/Downside Ratio  

For technical analysis strategies, recognizing directional change is essential to success. The upside/downside ratio is an effective way to help traders quickly get a feel for potential trends or the reversal of existing trends.



The upside/downside ratio is often smoothed using a simple moving average to filter out smaller, less significant movements. The indicator generates values greater than 1 when the volume on advancing issues is greater than declining issues. It generates values less than 1 when the volume on the declining issues is greater than advancing issues.






The upside/downside ratio, also known as the up/down volume ratio, is available as a technical indicator on many trading platforms.


   Trading With the Upside/Downside Ratio  
  Contrarian Strategies  

The upside/downside ratio is often used to gauge overbought and oversold conditions in the market. Low values can indicate that the market is reaching oversold levels, while high values can indicate that the market is becoming overbought.



As an example, if the indicator has a value of less than 1, traders could look for buy entry points in securities that are approaching significant support levels, such as stocks nearing their long-term trendlines.



Momentum traders, who trade in the direction of the prevailing trend, often use the upside/downside ratio to confirm the broader market has support from institutional investors. Traders may decide to use the indicator as a trade entry filter. For instance, they may only buy a stock when the indicator is above 1.5, or take a short position when it is below 0.5.






Traders should use other technical indicators in conjunction with the upside/downside ratio when building a trading strategy.


   Special Considerations  

Other technical indicators, such as the relative strength index (RSI) and stochastic oscillator, could be used with the upside/downside ratio to ensure the market is not in an extreme overbought or oversold condition and due for a price correction.



For example, if the indicator has a value less than 0.5 and the RSI is below 30, it may be prudent to avoid entering a short position until a short-term retracement occurs.
What Is an Upside Gap Two Crows?  

The upside gap two crows pattern is a three-day candlestick chart formation that signals an upward price move may be running out of momentum and could reverse lower. Since the pattern involves three specific candles in a certain order, the pattern is not very common.





Key Takeaways

The upside gap two crows is a three-candle pattern that signals a slowing of momentum in an uptrend, which could forewarn of a reversal lower. The pattern occurs in an uptrend, starting with a large up candle, a gap higher into a down candle, and then a larger down candle that engulfs the prior.A reversal lower is not assured. The price could move sideways or rally after the pattern.Some traders await "confirmation" before acting. This means waiting for the price to drop below the low of the third candle before selling or shorting.


   What Does the Upside Gap Two Crows Tell You?  

The upside gap two crows is a bearish reversal signal in technical analysis. The pattern has formed when the following requirements are met.



Candle 1: A bullish candle that continues the uptrend, represented by a long white (or green) candlestick that indicates a closing price well above the open price.
Candle 2: A bearish candle despite the security gapping higher at the open. Therefore, this candle gaps up from the prior candle, and is black with a close below the open.
Candle 3: A second bearish candle. The candle opens higher than the Candle 2 open, and closes below the Candle 2 close but above the Candle 1 close. This is visually represented by a bigger down candle that "engulfs" Candle 2.



There are several important hallmarks of this pattern. First, the pattern must form during a clear uptrend. Second, the first candle must be a large bullish candlestick (white or green) that continues an uptrend. This candle must be be followed by a bearish candlestick (black or red) that gaps up and has a small real body. Lastly, the third candle must be another bearish candlestick that engulfs the second candlestick; it opens above the prior candle and closes below it. However, the third candle must still close above the first day’s close.



The upside gap two crows signals that the security may be rolling over as its upward move ends and a downtrend begins. The rationale for this interpretation is that despite two strong opens (on Candle 2 and 3), the bulls have been unable to maintain upward momentum, suggesting that sentiment is turning from bullish to bearish.



The pattern is only three bars, therefore looking at context and for confirmation is useful in trading the pattern. In a strong uptrend the pattern may just be a pause before the price continues higher. Waiting for confirmation entails waiting for the price to continue dropping before the pattern is acted on. For example, a current long trade is exited only if the price continues to drop below the low of the third candle. A trader could also short or sell near the close of the third candle (no confirmation) placing a stop loss above the high of the third candle if going short.


   Example of How to Use the Upside Gap Two Crows Pattern  

The daily chart of Apple Inc. (APPL) shows an upside gap two crows pattern. The price is rising over the last three weeks and has a strong green candle followed by a gap higher and down candle, followed by a third down candle that engulfs the prior red candle.












​TradingView



A trader could use the pattern to signal an exit for long positions, exiting near the close of the third candle, or going short at that time. Alternatively the trader could wait for confirmation, exiting once the price drops below the low of the third candle in the pattern. The price gapped down after the pattern, so the following open would have provided the next exit (or short entry).



Just prior to the upside gap two crows pattern, there is a chart formation that looks very similar. It is not valid because the second candle closes inside the price area of the first candle (green), and the third candle doesn't open above the second.


   The Difference Between the Upside Gap Two Crows and the Three Black Crows Pattern  

The upside gap two crows pattern signals a possible reversal of an uptrend. Three black crows signal the same thing, but in a different way. Three black crows are three long bearish candles that occur following an uptrend. They signal that the uptrend has lost momentum and the bears have taken over, pushing the price lower.


   Limitations of the Upside Gap Two Crows Candlestick Pattern  

This candlestick pattern doesn't indicate how far the price could fall after the formation of the pattern, if in fact the price does fall. This means other forms of technical analysis or price action analysis are required in order find an exit point for short positions or indicate how far the price may decline.



The pattern doesn't always result in a reversal lower. The price could move sideways following the pattern or continue higher.

What Is an Upside Tasuki Gap?  

An Upside Tasuki Gap is a three-bar candlestick formation that is commonly used to signal the continuation of the current trend.



The first bar is a large white/green candlestick within a defined uptrend.
The second bar is another white/green candlestick with an opening price that has gapped above the close of the previous bar.
The third bar is a black/red candlestick that partially closes the gap between the first two bars.





Key Takeaways

The Upside Tasuki Gap is a three-bar candlestick formation that signals the continuation of the current uptrend.The Upside Tasuki Gap’s third candle partially closes the gap between the first two bars.Traders often use other gap patterns in conjunction with the Upside Tasuki gap to confirm bullish price action.

   Understanding the Upside Tasuki Gap  

The Upside Tasuki Gap demonstrates an uptrend’s strength through the gap open of the pattern’s second candle, as well as its escalating price. The pattern’s third candle indicates a pause in the trend as the bears attempt to move the price lower but cannot close the gap between the first and second candle. The bear’s inability to close the gap suggests the uptrend will likely continue.



Traders may also refer to the pattern as a Bullish Tasuki Gap or the Upward Gap Tasuki. Its adverse counterpart, which occurs in a bearish market, is known as a Downward Tasuki Gap. Both patterns are predicted to have originated from Japanese technical analysis.



The Upside Tasuki Gap is one of many gap patterns that can form throughout a bullish trend. Supporting uptrend gap patterns are also usually used in conjunction with the Upside Tasuki Gap to add confirmation to a bullish trading strategy.



Gaps are significant price changes that typically occur from one trading day to the next. Typical gap patterns form over two to three days of trading. It is not uncommon to see the price of an asset close a price gap previously created. Sometimes traders push the price higher too quickly, which can result in a slight pullback. The black/red candlestick that forms the Upside Tasuki Gap acts as a period of minor consolidation before the bulls continue to send the price higher.


   Upside Tasuki Gap Within an Uptrend  

Upside Tasuki Gaps can occur at any time during a bullish trending pattern. Bullish patterns typically follow a cycle that begins with a breakaway gap confirming a reversal and then several runaway gaps followed by an exhaustion gap. As the price of a security trends higher, it often forms an ascending channel. Traders construct the pattern by drawing two upward sloping lines at the peak and trough levels of price action. An Upside Tasuki Gap can occur within an ascending channel that also includes one or several of the gaps mentioned above.


   Practical Example of Trading the Tasuki Gap  

David spots an Upside Tasuki Gap on the iShares 10+ Year Investment Grade Corporate Bond ETF chart and wants to use the pattern to enter a trade and set risk parameters. He could enter on the close of the third red candle at $62.97 and place his stop-loss order beneath the low of the first candlestick at $62.08. Alternatively, David could place a buy stop order slightly above the pattern’s second candlestick high at $63.39 to confirm the uptrend has resumed and set his stop under the third candlestick’s low at $62.93.

What Is an Upstairs Market?  

The term upstairs market refers to a network that exists between large firms and institutional investors. This network involves large trades or block orders. Trades in these transactions are not submitted through a stock exchange, which means they are not visible to other market participants. These orders are carried out directly between buyers and sellers, with professional brokers acting as intermediaries. The size of the order made in the upstairs market accounts for a big portion of the market's trading volume.





Key Takeaways

The upstairs market is a network involving large firms and institutional investors.This market involves large blocks or high volumes of trade, which are made off the trading floor.Intermediaries are often involved in the upstairs market, which helps prevent insider trading.The upstairs market is the opposite of the downstairs market or stock exchanges.Regulators monitor the effects of trading in the upstairs market on retail investors.


   Understanding Upstairs Markets  

Upstairs markets involve networks of trading desks that conduct large volumes of trades. These trades are often called upstairs trades.﻿﻿ Because of the sheer volume involved, these trades are normally done by institutional investors, such as mutual funds, banks, pension funds, insurance companies, and brokerage companies.



As noted above, these trades take place off the trading floor and are normally done electronically or over the phone.﻿﻿ The way these upstairs trades are conducted means there are no large swings or disruptions to securities prices in the market.﻿﻿



Routing trades through professional intermediaries (i.e. away from the eyes of retail investors) can help prevent activities like front-running or trading that takes place by a broker who has inside information that will affect the price of a stock. Front-running may negatively impact the price or execution of a trade. 


   Special Considerations  

These markets are sometimes described as dark pools, hence the phrase “dark pools of liquidity”. Dark pools are financial exchanges, networks, or forums where the trading activity takes place, and are organized privately between the parties involved. Dark pools, like upstairs markets, allow investors to make large trades without having to disclose the details publicly. Although they may seem shady, dark pools—and upstairs trades—they are completely legal.﻿﻿



This doesn't mean that regulators aren't paying attention. As of 2014, trades executed in the upstairs market represented 15% of all trading activity in the United States, and there's a very good likelihood that that figure continues to grow.﻿﻿



Some authorities continue to question whether the practice undermines the transparency and accessibility of financial markets for retail investors. leading to stricter rules which help cut down on dark pool trading. For instance:



Canada introduced regulations in October 2012 that placed stricter limits on the conditions under which upstairs market transactions can take place
Australian regulators introduced similar restrictions in May 2013, which caused the volume of upstairs-market transactions to decline significantly in both countries﻿﻿



Regulators in the United States are also questioning whether this method of trading hurts retail investors and undermines trading activity, and have taken some steps to make the market fair for all participants. For instance, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) introduced an initiative that requires the weekly publication of trades that occur on an alternative trading system (ATS). It was approved by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in 2014.﻿﻿






Alternative trading systems allow trading activity to take place off exchanges and do not enforce rules about the conduct of participants, which is why regulators keep an eye on them.


   Upstairs Market vs. Downstairs Market  

If there's an upstairs market, then there's bound to be a downstairs market, right? The answer is yes. Since the upstairs market is a (private) network involving institutional investors, brokerage firms, and intermediaries, it's safe to assume that the downstairs markets are stock exchanges.



Downstairs markets, or stock exchanges, create liquidity in the market with trades that are executed by small investors, market makers, and traders who are actually on the floor. Unlike the upstairs market, which involves large trading volumes, trades that are conducted in the downstairs market are usually smaller.﻿﻿ Trade details are also available, including prices and the amount of stock traded.


   Advantages of an Upstairs Market  

If a hedge fund wishes to unload its position in a security and submits a large sell order to the stock exchange accordingly, that sell order may be interpreted by other market participants as a bearish signal on that particular security. This, in turn, may lead other investors to bid down the price of the security, causing the hedge fund to obtain a less favorable sale price.



The upstairs market can also be beneficial for institutional investors because of the reduced transaction fees. By carrying out a large block order with just one or a small number of institutional counterparties, the firms involved could pay substantially lower overall commissions or other fees as compared to trading with a much larger number of smaller counterparts. 



In some cases, such as when executing program trades that require several transactions to be executed simultaneously, using professional intermediaries in the upstairs market may in fact be the only way to effectively carry out the strategy.
What Is an Upstart?  

An upstart is a person who has risen in social rank and/or economic status, but who has yet to be widely accepted by other individuals in the newly found social and economic class.



"Upstart" is also the name of an online money lending platform founded in 2012 that provides personal loans using non-traditional credit variables, including education and employment status instead of standard credit ratings. An upstart should also not be confused with a startup, which is a newly formed business venture.





Key Takeaways

An upstart refers to a person who has had a sudden rise to a new class or status but lacks the social skills and grace that would be appropriate to the new position.Because there is an initial disconnect between the upstart and the social group that is joined, they may be rejected for apparent arrogance or misreading of certain norms of etiquette.If the upstart involves a newly promoted employee who cannot fit in with others at the upper levels of a firm, it may ultimately lead to their dismissal.


   Understanding Upstarts  

An upstart is a person who has jumped up in social rank or economic class suddenly. For example, an individual could go from the proverbial rags to riches following an inheritance or following a lucky investment in the stock market. The upstart, who has quickly risen in economic status, has yet to learn the social skills necessary to be accepted by other people in their new class. Instead of being humbled by this and asking for instruction or attempting to learn, the upstart becomes arrogant and presumptuous, which turns off associates in the new social class. If the upstart is consistently rejected, they may become increasingly stubborn and opinionated as they are spurned.



As in the case of a person who has suddenly become wealthy, the upstart may respond by acting superior to others. Especially if the new position requires the upstart to manage or lead people, this change can be disastrous if the upstart does not have the skills needed to do well in the role, while still having an inflated attitude about being a leader.


   Upstarts as Employees  

While an upstart can make for a bad manager, they can make for an even worse employee. As an upstart gains money and position, they are less inclined to self-correct and work as a team player, and more inclined to view their own work more positively than they view others. This can cause a great deal of disharmony and bad feelings in the workplace, as the upstart’s manager and co-workers begin to resent the upstart.



If the upstart is unable to correct and restore healthy working relationships, then they will likely fail in the job, even if they have the technical skills to succeed.
What Is Upstream?  

Upstream is a term for the operations stages in the oil and gas industry that involve exploration and production. Oil and gas companies can generally be divided into three segments: upstream, midstream, and downstream. Upstream firms deal primarily with the exploration and initial production stages of the oil and gas industry.



Many large oil companies are called "integrated" because they combine upstream activities with midstream and downstream operations, which take place after the production phase through to the point of sale.





Key Takeaways

Upstream refers to points in production that originate early on in the processes.Also called exploration and production (E&P), upstream is farthest from the end-user consumer in the oil & gas supply chain.Upstream activities include exploration, drilling, and extraction.Upstream is followed by midstream (transportation of crude oil) and downstream (refining and distribution) phases.Today many large oil companies are integrated, in that they maintain upstream, midstream, and downstream units.


   Understanding Upstream  

The upstream sector of the oil and gas industry includes all the steps involved from the preliminary exploration through the extraction of the resource. Upstream companies can be involved in all the steps of this phase of the life cycle of the oil and gas industry, or they may only be involved in part of the upstream sector.



Another name for the upstream oil sector, which is actually more representative of what occurs in this stage of development of an oil asset and/or natural gas asset, is the exploration and production (E&P) sector. The E&P segment is the earliest portion of the oil and gas production process. Companies within this segment are primarily focused on locating and extracting commodities from the earth.



The exploration stage involves the search for hydrocarbons, which are the primary components of petroleum and natural gas. Land surveys are performed to help identify the areas that are the most promising. The goal is to locate specific minerals underground in order to estimate the amount of oil and gas reserves before drilling. Geologists study rock formations and layers of sediment within the soil to identify if oil or natural gas is present.



The process can involve seismology, which uses substantial vibrations as a result of machinery or explosives to create seismic waves. How the seismic waves interact with a reservoir containing oil and gas helps to pinpoint the reservoir's location. Once it has been determined that there appear to be reserves beneath the ground, the test drilling process can begin.






Upstream companies measure oil production in barrels. One barrel, usually abbreviated as bbl, is equal to 42 U.S. gallons. Companies often describe production in terms of bbl per day or bbl per quarter.


   The Oil Exploration Process  

Oil and gas exploration is an important part of the upstream sector. Petroleum exploration requires very sophisticated techniques, and the technology available for petroleum exploration is rapidly advancing.



Normally, exploration starts in an area that has a high potential to hold a resource, usually due to the local geology and known nearby petroleum deposits. In a high-potential area, further exploration is completed to delineate a resource. The geophysical and geochemical analysis is done using techniques including induced polarization (IP) surveys, drilling and assaying, electrical currents, and so on.



In the exploration phase, the goal is to locate and estimate the potential of a resource. If an area shows potential to host a resource, exploratory wells are drilled to test the resource. In the oil and gas sector, test drilling is an important component of the exploration phase. In the event that the exploratory well is successful, the next step is to construct wells and extract the resource. Upstream companies also operate the wells that bring the crude oil or natural gas to the surface.






Rig count and utilization rates are economic indicators of the amount of activity happening in the United States at any given time.


   Midstream and Downstream  

Once the resource has been extracted, the upstream part of the business is over. Midstream companies gather the raw resource and transport the resource via pipeline, railway, or tanker truck to refineries. Refineries are the downstream phase of the oil and gas industry. They process the raw crude oil into their end petroleum products. They also sell and distribute natural gas and the products that are derived from crude oil.


  Midstream  

Midstream is a term used to describe one of the three major stages of oil and gas industry operations. Midstream activities include the processing, storing, transporting, and marketing of oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids. Midstream companies focus on the storage and transportation of oil and natural gas through pipelines. Midstream companies deliver the reserves to companies involved in the final stage of production called downstream.


  Downstream  

Companies in the downstream sector are those that provide the closest link to everyday users.  Downstream operations are the processes involved in converting oil and gas into the finished product. These include refining crude oil into gasoline, natural gas liquids, diesel, and a variety of other energy sources. The closer an oil and gas company is to the process of providing consumers with petroleum products, the further downstream the company is said to be.


   Examples of Upstream Companies  

Upstream oil and gas production and operations identify deposits, drill wells, and recover raw materials from underground and are involved in exploration and extraction. Many of those employed in the upstream part of the industry include geologists, geophysicists, service rig operators, engineering firms, scientists, and seismic and drilling contractors.



China National Offshore Oil Corporation and Schlumberger (SLB) are examples of large companies that focus on upstream services.



Today, most of the global oil giants have both upstream and downstream activities, and are known as integrated oil companies. Many of the largest upstream operators today are therefore major diversified oil and gas firms, such as Exxon-Mobil (XOM) and Chevron (CVX)




What Does Upstream Mean in the Oil and Gas Industry?
Upstream refers to the initial phases of oil and gas production, involving exploration, drilling, and extraction of crude oil and natural gas.




What Is the Difference Between Upstream and Downstream?
While upstream entails the initial phases of oil and gas production, downstream encompasses the final phases including refining and distribution of finished products like gasoline to consumers. In general, the farther a part of the process is from the end-user consumer, the more upstream it is.




What Are the Three Sectors of the Oil and Gas Industry?
In addition to upstream and downstream, the midstream sector is involved with the transportation of oil and gas extracted from the earth via pipelines, ships, trucks, or trains to the refineries.




What Are Examples of Upstream Companies?
The upstream sector involves companies that search for deposits of oil or gas (exploration) and then its extraction through drilling or other methods. Upstream also includes related services companies such as those dealing in rig operations, feasibility studies, machinery rental, and extraction of chemical supply.




Is a Refinery Upstream or Downstream?
A refinery is considered to be downstream.
What Is the Upstream Capital Costs Index (UCCI)?  

The Upstream Capital Costs Index (UCCI) is a proprietary metric index that tracks the composite capital cost of materials, facilities, equipment, and personnel for oil and natural gas producing projects. Cambridge Energy Research Associates (CERA), formerly owned by IHS Markit, merged with S&P Global in February 2022, which owns and manages the index.





Key Takeaways

The Upstream Capital Costs Index (UCCI) tracks the composite capital cost of materials, facilities, equipment, and personnel for oil and natural gas producing projects.Cambridge Energy Research Associates (CERA), formerly IHS Markit, now under S&P Global, owns and manages the UCCI.The index works as a benchmarking tool for analysts, traders, and others interested in the oil and gas industry.


   Understanding the Upstream Capital Costs Index (UCCI)  

S&P Global's Upstream Capital Costs Index (UCCI) offers a concise benchmarking tool for analysts, traders, and others interested in the oil and gas industry. Use of the index is helpful in tracking and forecasting the performance of the underlying oil and gas properties. 



The UCCI is only one of a family of indexes published by S&P Global, a global data, analytics, technology, and advisory firm. The company’s indexes include: 



Upstream Operating Costs Index (UOCI), which tracks the changing costs for oil and gas field operationsDownstream Capital Costs Index (DCCI), which tracks capital expenses for the construction of petroleum projectsNorth American Cost Index (NACI), which investigates the cost of producing oil and natural gas in North AmericaUpstream Innovation Index (UII), which tracks the cost of efficiency and design changes on a portfolio of projects


   Components of the UCCI  

The 28 projects included in the UCCI represent a diversified portfolio of liquified natural gas (LNG), pipeline, onshore, and offshore projects in a range of geographic locations. The index looks at the changes to operating and capital costs over specific time frames.



Generally, oil and gas production separates into the upstream, midstream, and downstream stages. The upstream segment of operations involves exploration and production (E&P) of oil and natural gas. Many large integrated oil companies combine upstream activities with midstream and downstream operations.



The composite cost of capital is a company's cost to finance its business and projects. The determination of this amount is known as the weighted average cost of capital (WACC). The calculation involves multiplying the cost of each of the individual capital components by its proportional weight and then summing the results. A high composite cost of capital indicates that a company has high borrowing costs.


   History of the UCCI  

Cambridge Energy Research Associates (CERA), established in 1983 in Cambridge, Massachusetts, focuses on energy research and consulting for the energy industry. The company has the distinction of being a leading authority on energy markets and related trends and statistics.



CERA serves as an advisory source for government departments and private companies. IHS Energy, a prominent source of information related to the oil and gas industry, acquired CERA in 2004. In 2009, the joint organization adopted the new blended name of IHS CERA, Inc. IHS CERA merged with S&P Global in February 2022.




What Does "Upstream" Mean in the Oil and Gas Industry?
In extractive industries, "upstream" refers to the earliest stages of operation, such as exploration, drilling, and mining. "Upstream costs" refer to the costs of drilling and pumping mineral resources before shipping them to the next stage of the production process.




What Does "Downstream" Mean?
In extractive industries, "downstream" refers to the last stages of operation, just before products are sold to consumers. In petrochemical industries, this can include refining and transportation to the final destination.




What Does "Midstream" Mean in the Oil and Gas Industry?
In extractive industries, "midstream" refers to intermediate operations between extracting and delivering final products to consumers. This includes piping and transportation operations between extraction points and refineries. It also includes processing plants that remove sulfur from raw natural gas and produce natural gas liquids.


   The Bottom Line  

The Upstream Capital Costs Index (UCCI) measures the capital costs for businesses that extract oil and natural gas. It is part of a larger family of indexes published by S&P Global to evaluate the costs for companies in those industries.
What Is an Upstream Guarantee?  

An upstream guarantee, also known as a subsidiary guarantee, is a financial guarantee in which the subsidiary guarantees its parent company's debt.



An upstream guarantee can be contrasted with a downstream guarantee, which is a pledge placed on a loan on behalf of the borrowing party by the borrowing party's parent company or stockholder.





Key Takeaways

An upstream guarantee is when a parent company's debt or obligation is backed by one or more of its subsidiaries.Such a guarantee may be required by a lender when the parent company's primary asset base is its ownership in the subsidiary itself.Upstream guarantees are also utilized in leveraged buyouts when the parent company owns insufficient assets to back the buyout syndicate's debt-financed purchase.


   How Upstream Guarantees Work  

Upstream guarantees enable a parent company to obtain debt financing on better financing terms, by expanding the available collateral. They often occur in leveraged buy-outs, when the parent company does not have enough assets to pledge as collateral.



A payment guaranty obligates the guarantor to pay the debt should the borrower default, regardless of whether the lender makes a demand on the borrower. Alternatively, a collection guaranty only obligates the guarantor if the lender cannot collect the amount owed after bringing a lawsuit and exhausting its remedies against the borrower. Guaranties can be absolute, limited or conditional.



Typically, a lender will insist on an upstream guaranty when it lends to a parent whose only asset is stock ownership of a subsidiary. In this case, the subsidiary owns substantially all the assets upon which the lender bases its credit decision.



The problem with upstream guarantees is that lenders are exposed to the risk of being sued for fraudulent conveyance when the guarantor is insolvent or without adequate capital at the time it executed the guarantee. If the issue of fraudulent conveyance is successfully proved in a bankruptcy court, the lender would become an unsecured creditor, clearly a bad outcome for the lender.



Since the subsidiary guaranteeing the debt payments owns no stock in the parent company borrowing the funds, the former does not directly receive any benefits from the loan proceeds and, hence, does not receive a reasonably equivalent value for the guarantee provided.


   Upstream vs. Downstream Guarantees  

An upstream guarantee, like a downstream guarantee in which the parent company guarantees the subsidiary company’s debt, does not have to be recorded as a liability on the balance sheet. However, it is disclosed as a contingent liability, including any provisions that might enable the guarantor to recover funds paid out in a guarantee.



A downstream guarantee can be undertaken in order to help a subsidiary company obtain debt financing that it otherwise would be unable to obtain, or to obtain funds at interest rates that would be lower than it could obtain without the guarantee from its parent company.



In many instances, a lender may be willing to provide ﬁnancing to a corporate borrower only if an afﬁliate agrees to guarantee the loan. This is because, once backed by the financial strength of the holding company, the subsidiary company's risk of defaulting on its debt is considerably less. The guarantee is similar to one individual cosigning for another on a loan.
What Is an Uptick?  

Uptick describes an increase in the price of a financial instrument since the preceding transaction. An uptick occurs when a security’s price rises in relation to the last tick or trade. An uptick is sometimes also referred to as a plus tick.





Key Takeaways

An uptick is a transaction for a financial instrument executed at a higher price than the previous trade.Since 2001, the minimum tick size for stocks trading above $1 is 1 cent.The uptick rule, originally in place from 1938 to 2007, dictated that a short sale could only be made on an uptick.In 2010, a new alternative rule was introduced, ordering short-sellers to execute trades only on an uptick if the security has already fallen 10% in a day.A downtick is when the price of a security moves down by at least 1 cent from its previous trade.


   How an Uptick Works  

Since 2001, the minimum tick size for stocks trading above $1 is 1 cent. That means that a stock that goes from $9 to at least $9.01 would be considered to be on an uptick. Conversely, if it goes from $9 to $8.99, it would be on a downtick.



A stock can only experience an uptick if enough investors are willing to step in and buy it. Consider a stock that is trading at $9/$9.01. If the prevailing sentiment for the stock is bearish, sellers will have little hesitation in “hitting the bid” at $9, rather than holding out for a higher price. 



Likewise, potential buyers will be content to wait for a lower price, given the bearish sentiment, and may lower their bid for the stock to, say, $8.95. If the stock's sellers significantly outnumber buyers, this lower bid will likely be snapped up by them.






On the CME exchanges, tick sizes are set by the exchange and vary by contract instrument.



In this manner, the stock may trade down to $8.80, for example, without an uptick. At this point, however, the selling pressure may have eased up because the remaining sellers are willing to wait, while buyers who think the stock is cheap may increase their bid to $8.81. If a transaction occurs at $8.81, it would be considered an uptick, since the previous transaction was at $8.80.


   Types of Upticks  

There are several terms that contain the word uptick. They include zero upticks, which refers to a transaction executed at the same price as the trade immediately preceding it, but at a price higher than the transaction before that; uptick volume, meaning the number of shares traded while a stock price is rising; and the uptick rule.


   Special Considerations  

The significance of an uptick in financial markets is largely related to the uptick rule. This directive, originally in place from 1938 to 2007, dictated that a short sale could only be made on an uptick. It was introduced to prevent short sellers from piling too much pressure on a falling stock price.





Important

The repeal of the U.S. uptick rule in July 2007 has been highlighted by many market experts as a contributing factor in the surge in volatility and the unprecedented bear market of 2008-09.



In the absence of an uptick rule, short-sellers can hammer the stock down relentlessly, since they are not required to wait for an uptick to sell it short. Such concerted selling may attract more bears and scare buyers away, creating an imbalance that could lead to a precipitous decline in a faltering stock.


   Alternative Uptick Rule  

In February 2010, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) introduced an “alternative uptick rule," designed to promote market stability and preserve investor confidence during periods of volatility.



The new rule states that short-selling a stock that has already declined by at least 10% in one day would only be permitted on an uptick. It is hoped that this will give investors enough time to exit long positions before bearish sentiment potentially spirals out of control, leading them to lose a fortune.



Most securities are covered by the rule. In the event it is activated, the alternative uptick rule would apply to short sale orders for the remainder of the day, as well as the following day.


   Example of an Uptick  

Stock ABC is currently priced at $15.50. Sentiment on the stock is positive, as the company has come out with a new product that is supposed to outperform all competitors. Investors are bullish on the stock and start purchasing it. The stock goes from $15.50 to $15.60 in one transaction, which is an uptick.




What Is Uptick Volume?
Uptick volume refers to the number of shares that are traded when a stock is on an uptick. Uptick volume is used by technical traders, who use it to determine a stock's net volume; the difference between its uptick volume and downtick volume. Investors and traders look for uptick volume, which is a shift in volume upwards, to determine a new trend of a stock moving up.




What Is the Difference Between Uptick and Downtick?
The difference between uptick and downtick is that an uptick is an increase in a stock's price from its previous transaction. The increase has to be by at least 1 cent. A downtick is a decrease in a stock's price from its previous transaction. The decrease has to be at least by 1 cent.




What Is the Downtick-Uptick Rule?
The downtick-uptick rule, also known as Rule 80A, was a rule that the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) had established to maintain orderly markets in a market downturn. The rule was abolished in 2007. The rule stated that whenever the NYSE Composite Index gained or lost more than 2% from the previous day that all sell trades on S&P 500 stocks during an upturn in the market be labeled as "sell-plus" and that all buy trades during a downturn in the market be labeled as "buy-plus." These trades were flagged before execution in order to slow trading on S&P 500 companies because it halted the use of program trades that usually trade in large volumes.




What Does an Uptick in Bond Yields Mean?
An uptick in bond yields means the returns that an investor will receive from investing in the bond will be higher. When the yield of a bond goes up, its price goes down.


   The Bottom Line  

An uptick is an increase in a stock's price by at least 1 cent from its previous trade. Traders and investors look to upticks and downticks to determine what price a stock may be moving and what might be the best time to buy or sell a security.
What Is the Uptick Rule?  

The Uptick Rule (also known as the "plus tick rule") is a rule established by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) that requires short sales to be conducted at a higher price than the previous trade.



Investors engage in short sales when they expect a securities price to fall. The tactic involves selling high and buying low. While short selling can improve market liquidity and pricing efficiency, it can also be used improperly to drive down the price of a security or to accelerate a market decline.





Key Takeaways

The SEC's Uptick Rule requires short sales to be conducted at a higher price than the previous trade.There are limited exemptions to the rule.A revised rule implemented in 2010 lets investors exit long positions before short selling is triggered. 


   Understanding the Uptick Rule  

The Uptick Rule prevents sellers from accelerating the downward momentum of a securities price already in sharp decline. By entering a short-sale order with a price above the current bid, a short seller ensures that an order is filled on an uptick.



The original rule was introduced by the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as Rule 10a-1 and implemented in 1938. The SEC eliminated the original rule in 2007, but approved an alternative rule in 2010. The rule requires trading centers to establish and enforce procedures that prevent the execution or display of a prohibited short sale.


  The Alternative Uptick Rule  

The 2010 alternative uptick rule (Rule 201) allows investors to exit long positions before short selling occurs. The rule is triggered when a stock price falls at least 10% in one day. At that point, short selling is permitted if the price is above the current best bid.﻿﻿ This aims to preserve investor confidence and promote market stability during periods of stress and volatility.



The rule's "duration of price test restriction" applies the rule for the remainder of the trading day and the following day. It generally applies to all equity securities listed on a national securities exchange, whether traded via the exchange or over the counter.






The Uptick Rule is designed to preserve investor confidence and stabilize the market during periods of stress and volatility, such as a market "panic" that sends prices plummeting.


   Exemptions to the Rule  

For futures, there are limited exemptions to the uptick rule. These instruments can be shorted on a downtick because they are highly liquid and have enough buyers willing to enter into a long position, ensuring that the price will rarely be driven to unjustifiably low levels.



To qualify for the exemption, the futures contract must be deemed to be "owned by the seller." This means that according to the SEC, that the person "holds a security futures contract to purchase it and has received notice that the position will be physically settled and is irrevocably bound to receive the underlying security.”
What Is Uptick Volume?  

The term uptick volume refers to the volume of shares traded while a stock price rises. It is one of many indicators used by investors to make buy and sell decisions.



Uptick volume is commonly used by traders who engage in technical analysis—the theory of using charts to see movements and patterns in stock prices and volumes over time. It is used to determine a stock's net volume—the measurement of its momentum—by subtracting the uptick volume from the downtick volume.





Key Takeaways

Uptick volume is the volume of shares traded while a stock price is on the rise. Traders who engage in technical analysis commonly use uptick volume in their trading strategies.Investors look for uptick volume as evidence that a stock is in the early stages of a significant move upwards.Stock prices typically find bands of resistance when both the upward and downward momentum is thwarted, making no clear trend or movement evident.Trading volume can show how the volatility of the market. 


   Understanding Uptick Volume  

Trading volume is an excellent indicator of how much volatility there is in the market. Uptick volume is used in trading strategies by investors who are focused primarily on chart trends instead of those who follow company fundamentals. These investors look for the initial signs of significant momentum shifts upward—the uptick volume—as well as downward shifts, which are called downtick volume.



Uptick volume measures the volume of shares traded while the stock price rises. Downtick measures momentum heading downwards in a stock price, correlated with volume.



Investors look for uptick volume as evidence that a stock is in the early stages of a significant move upwards. Stock prices typically find bands of resistance when both the upward and downward momentum is thwarted, making no clear trend or movement evident. Breaking upward from this resistance zone is referred to as uptick volume.



Technical analysts and investors look at the uptick/downtick indicator when determining whether to buy, sell, or short a particular stock. Investors can look at large blocks of stock traded through publicly available data and determine whether the stock is ticking up or down. This trading technique is a subset of the overall investor interest in money flows. Money flow calculates the average high, low, and closing price of a stock multiplied by the daily volume. Investors use that daily data to compare it to previous data in seeing whether the money flow trend is positive or negative.






Investors can use a stock's net value—the difference between the uptick and downtick volumes—to determine whether there's a bullish or bearish trend in the market.


   Uptick Volume vs. Downtick Volume vs. Net Volume  

As mentioned above, uptick volume indicates whether a stock will trend upward. By contrast, downtick volume outlines when a stock price will reverse and drop. Just like uptick volume, downtick volume is used by analysts and investors to understand market movement while predicting where it will go in the future.



Essentially, the term downtick volume refers to the total number of shares traded at a price that is lower than the price it traded at immediately before. This metric is often used to help make predictions about whether and when the market will reverse its course.



When used together, uptick and downtick volumes calculate a stock's net volume—the resulting difference between the two. The net volume is the technical indicator that helps investors determine whether there's a bullish or bearish trend. If the difference between the uptick and downtick volumes is positive, the net volume is bullish. By contrast, a negative result means a bearish course.


   Special Considerations  

As noted earlier, uptick volume is a subset of technical analysis. This is the theory that investors employ when using charts to see movements and patterns in stock prices and volumes over time. Technical analysis is less concerned with the actual fundamentals of a particular stock and more with the movements indicating buy and sell opportunities.



On the other hand, fundamental stock analysis is, of course, very important for anyone who wants to buy and hold a solid company for many years. Fundamental analysis looks at a company’s vital health statistics such as cash flow, product pipeline, and management track record. Fundamental analysis can be of less interest to day traders and others getting in and out of stocks quickly through their reliance on technical analysis to make money.



Other trading indicators such as the Accumulation Area and the Joseph Effect help determine the stock price and volume momentum. Seasoned investors typically use several models simultaneously to help avoid the pitfalls of false signals that often present themselves in a single model due to other activities occurring outside of that particular model.

What Is an Uptrend?  

An uptrend describes the price movement of a financial asset when the overall direction is upward. In an uptrend, each successive peak and trough is higher than the ones found earlier in the trend. The uptrend is therefore composed of higher swing lows and higher swing highs. As long as the price is making these higher swing lows and higher swing highs, the uptrend is considered intact.



Some market participants only choose to trade during uptrends. These "long" trend traders utilize various strategies to take advantage of the tendency for the price to make higher highs and higher lows.



Uptrends may be contrasted with downtrends.





Key Takeaways

Uptrends are characterized by higher peaks and troughs over time and imply bullish sentiment among investors.A change in trend is fueled by a change in the supply of stocks investors want to buy compared with the supply of available shares in the market.Uptrends are often coincidental with positive changes in the factors that surround the security, whether macroeconomic or specifically associated with a company's business model.


   Understanding an Uptrend  

An upward trend provides investors with an opportunity to profit from rising asset prices. Selling an asset once it has failed to create a higher peak and trough is one of the most effective ways to avoid large losses that can result from a change in trend. Some technical traders utilize trendlines to identify an uptrend and spot possible trend reversals. The trendline is drawn along the rising swing lows, helping to show where future swing lows may form.



Moving averages are also utilized by some technical traders to analyze uptrends. When the price is above the moving average the trend is considered up. Conversely, when the price drops below the moving average it means the price is now trading below the average price over a given period and may therefore no longer be in an uptrend.



While these tools may be helpful in visually seeing the uptrend, ultimately the price should be making higher swing highs and higher swing lows to confirm that an uptrend is present. When an asset fails to produce higher swing highs and lows, it means that a downtrend could be underway, the asset is ranging, or the price action is choppy and the trend direction is hard to determine. In such cases, uptrend traders may opt to step aside until an uptrend is clearly visible.


   Trading Uptrends  

There are many techniques for analyzing and trading an uptrend. Looking only at price action is one way. Using tools such as trendlines and technical indicators another.



Two common price action trading strategies—which can be confirmed or invalidated with additional input from technical tools and indicators—are to buy when the price pulls back during an uptrend, or to buy when the price is attempting to make a new swing high. Even as the price rises, it will oscillate up and down. The moves lower are called pullbacks. If a trader or investor believes the price will continue higher after the pullback, they can buy during the pullback and profit from the ensuing price rise.



Some trend traders view buying during a pullback as too risky or time-consuming since there is uncertainty as to whether the price will rise again, and when. These traders may prefer to wait for the price to be definitively rising again. This means they may end up buying near the prior swing high, or when the asset pushes into new high territory.



Both strategies require specific entry criteria to enter a trade. The trader buying during pullbacks may look to buy only if the price is near anticipated support, such as a rising trendline, moving average, or Fibonacci retracement level. They may also wait for selling on the pullback to slow and for the price to start turning up before buying.



Traders that buy near prior highs, because they want to see that the price is moving higher again, may decide to only enter once the price moves above a short-term resistance level. This could be a consolidation or chart pattern high. Alternatively, they may wait for the price to move to new highs on a big volume jump, or for a technical indicator to flash a buy signal.



Risk is controlled with a stop loss. This is typically placed below a recent swing low since the trader is expecting the price to move higher.



Ways to exit a profitable trade are plentiful. These could include when the price makes a lower swing low, a technical indicator turns bearish, a trendline or moving average is broken, or a trailing stop loss is hit.



Those interested in learning more about uptrends and other financial topics may want to consider enrolling in one of the best technical analysis courses currently available.


   Example of Analyzing and Trading an Uptrend  

The following Meta (formerly Facebook) Inc. chart shows numerous examples of potential trades using support or penetration of resistance on increasing volume. A moving average has been added to aid in finding possible support areas.



Several longs have been highlighted with arrows that show a break of resistance on increased volume. The price consolidated while in an overall uptrend and then broke higher. Waiting for the volume increase was important; otherwise, it is possible that trades would have been entered too early, or not at ideal times.

The small green arrows that are not linked to volume increases are a few of the potential trades that occurred during pullbacks or near support. In these cases, trades are marked where the price fell briefly below the moving average, but then started to climb again.



There are many strategies that can be associated with uptrends. These are general entry strategies for demonstration purposes only.



While the price was in a downtrend, trades were avoided.
What Is the Urban Development Act of 1970?  

The Urban Development Act of 1970 is legislation enforced through the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) that introduced the Federal Experimental Housing Allowance Program and Community Development Corporation.



This act was passed to do the following:



Establish a national growth policy in the U.S.Encourage and support sensible growth and development in states, metropolitan regions, counties, cities, and towns highlighting new community and inner-city growthAmend certain laws regarding housing and urban development





Key Takeaways

Also known as the Housing and Urban Development Act of 1970, the Urban Development Act expanded federal assistance to housing subsidy programs for low-income tenants.The act created the Community Development Corporation, which is a non-profit focused on revitalizing poor communities through direct investment and business development.It also ran the Federal Experimental Housing Allowance Program, finding that housing subsidies may not have the positive effect that was initially thought.


   Understanding Urban Development Act of 1970  

The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development was established in 1937 through the U.S. Housing Act of 1937. The Department of Housing and Urban Development Act of 1965 established HUD as a Cabinet-level agency within the U.S. government. The Urban Development Act of 1970 authorized the government to provide greater outlays for housing subsidy programs and rent supplement programs for low and moderate-income households.



Funding for projects related to the act comes from a variety of sources including state, local, and federal government, donations from individuals and corporations, as well as loans through traditional and non-traditional financial institutions.



The act created the Community Development Corporation, a national network of nonprofit, community-based organizations focused on revitalizing their local communities, typically low-income, under-served neighborhoods that have deteriorated and where investment is scant. First and foremost, these organizations help develop affordable housing, but they are also involved in economic development, sanitation, street beautification, and neighborhood planning projects.


   The Federal Experimental Housing Allowance Program  

The Act also ran the Federal Experimental Housing Allowance Program, which began in 1973 and ended in 1979, involving more than 25,000 families in 12 metropolitan areas with some $170 million in subsidies to individual families. The idea was to see how best to improve housing conditions for low-income people by giving them vouchers to pay for market-rate housing rather than build new public housing.



The Urban Institute concluded in the late 1970s that housing allowances “do not provide significant momentum towards most of the stated goals of HUD policy." Later policies had HUD providing subsidies directly to landlords through the Section 8 program, and building additional large public housing projects, an activity that has largely ended.



Federal spending on housing is mostly geared toward wealthier people. A 2017 study by Apartment List found the popular tax break called the mortgage interest deduction (MID), cost the federal government $71 billion in 2015, more than double the $29 billion spent on Section 8 funding for low-income renters. In addition, over half of high-income households claim MID, while just 11% of low-income households receive subsidies of any kind for housing.






Mortgage lending discrimination is illegal. If you think you've been discriminated against based on race, religion, sex, marital status, use of public assistance, national origin, disability, or age, there are steps you can take. One such step is to file a report to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau or with the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD).
What Is the U.S. Agency for International Development?  

The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) is an independent federal agency that provides civilian aid to foreign countries. By providing development and humanitarian assistance, the agency aims to further American interests abroad while improving lives in the developing world.





Key Takeaways

President John F. Kennedy created USAID in 1961 to administer the federal government's foreign assistance programs.﻿﻿Though independent, USAID is subject to the guidance of the President, the Secretary of State, and the National Security Council.﻿﻿USAID implements more than $20 billion in combined annual appropriations, most of which come from the U.S. State Department.Sub-Saharan Africa receives 39% of USAID distributions, with most funding going toward health and humanitarian efforts.﻿﻿


   Understanding the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID)  

In 1961, President John F. Kennedy signed the Foreign Assistance Act into law and created USAID by executive order. The agency is tasked with administering the federal government's civilian foreign aid programs, which include disaster relief, technical assistance, poverty alleviation, and economic development.



While USAID is independent, it is subject to the guidance of the President, the Secretary of State, and the National Security Council. The agency's administrator and deputy administrator are appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate.



USAID is responsible for implementing more than $20 billion in combined annual appropriations, most of which come from the U.S. State Department. The agency provides assistance to more than 120 countries. The top 10 recipients, in order of funding, are: Jordan, Afghanistan, Ethiopia, Yemen, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Nigeria, Syria, South Sudan, Kenya, and Iraq. Sub-Saharan Africa receives 39% of USAID distributions, with the majority of funding going toward health and humanitarian efforts.


   History of USAID  

U.S. civilian assistance to foreign nations began in the 19th century with informal "technical missions," in which experts—often with government assistance—traveled to Asia and Latin America to spread knowledge of industrial techniques, economic policy, sanitation, and other fields. In 1919, Congress formed the American Relief Administration to provide humanitarian assistance to post-war Europe.



Following World War II, the Marshall Plan—launched in a speech delivered by Secretary of State George Marshall on June 5, 1947—is considered by many historians to have been the most effective U.S. foreign aid program ever. This plan saw the U.S. spend roughly $13.3 billion (or $143 billion in 2017 dollars (in real terms if we consider inflation) to rebuild war-ravaged European economies.



The Cold War led to competition between the Soviet Union and the U.S. to win the favor of "third-world" countries (that is, outside the first-world West or second-world communist bloc). While much of this effort was focused on military aid, civilian assistance also played a part.



President Harry S. Truman built upon the Marshall Plan by making international aid a key part of U.S. foreign policy. The goal was to to create markets for the U.S. by reducing poverty and increasing production in developing countries. It was in this context that President Kennedy ordered the State Department to create an independent agency to coordinate civilian foreign aid.

What Does the HHS Do?
The HHS is responsible for promoting and enhancing the health of the citizens of the United States of America. It has over 100 programs that focus on health, science, care, social services, prevention, and wellness, all aimed to ensure the well-being of the American people.




Who Is the Current HHS Secretary?
The current HHS Secretary is Xavier Becerra. He is the 25th secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services as well as the first Latino to hold the office.
What Is the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD)?  

The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) is a U.S. government agency created in 1965 as part of then-President Lyndon Johnson’s Great Society agenda to expand America’s welfare state. Its primary mission is improving affordable homeownership opportunities to support the housing market and homeownership in inner-city areas.



HUD’s programs are geared toward increasing safe and affordable rental options, reducing chronic homelessness, fighting housing discrimination by ensuring equal opportunity in the rental and purchase markets, and supporting vulnerable populations.





Key Takeaways

The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) is a U.S. government agency that supports community development and homeownership.HUD enforces the Fair Housing Act and offers housing assistance through the Community Development Block Grant program and the Housing Choice Voucher program.The Fair Housing Act prohibits discrimination in housing based on sex, race, color, national origin, religion, family status, and disability.


   Understanding HUD  

HUD enforces the Fair Housing Act and oversees the Community Development Block Grant program and the Housing Choice Voucher program. It also supervises other programs to assist low-income and disadvantaged Americans with their housing needs and it works with various government agencies and private organizations, including community nonprofits and faith-based groups, to reach its goals.






Following Hurricane Katrina, HUD became involved in disaster recovery in the Gulf Coast region.



The Fair Housing Act prohibits discrimination in housing based on sex, race, color, national origin, religion, family status, and disability. HUD investigates any cases concerning the refusal to rent or sell a property, denying someone a dwelling, falsely stating that properties are unavailable, and imposing different terms or conditions based on any of the aforementioned discriminating conditions.



HUD is led by the HUD secretary, a member of the president’s cabinet who is nominated by the president and confirmed by the Senate. The position is currently held by Marcia Fudge, who took office on March 10, 2021.


   Types of HUD Assistance Programs  

HUD offers various assistance programs for those in need of housing financial assistance.


  Housing  

The Office of Housing is the largest office within HUD and includes the Federal Housing Administration. As stated on the HUD website, the duties of the office include:



Operating FHA and providing over mortgage insurance on mortgages for single-family homes, multifamily properties, and healthcare facilities
Operating HUD's Manufactured Housing program
Managing HUD's Project-Based Rental Assistance and other rental assistance programs, which provide support for low and very low-income households
Supporting the Housing for the Elderly and Housing for Persons with Disabilities programs, which provide affordable housing for vulnerable populations
Encouraging recapitalization of the nation's aging affordable housing stock through programs such as the Rental Assistance Demonstration
Facilitating housing counseling assistance through HUD's Office of Housing Counseling


  Grants  

The Community Development Block Grant program allocates federal grant money to communities to develop neighborhoods that have decent, affordable housing. These grants typically aid low- and middle-income residents so they can find suitable living environments near employers, supermarkets, or public transportation. States, cities, towns, communities, and organizations apply for these block grants or for loan guarantees to aid in development projects.


  Vouchers  

The Housing Choice Voucher program, also called Section 8, allows low-income, disabled, or elderly citizens to choose a place to live regardless of whether the property exists as subsidized housing. The property must meet certain requirements and applicants need to meet government standards to qualify.



Local public housing authorities determine a moderately priced housing option based on local real estate prices before deciding the benefits that families or individuals can receive. Families then seek out a housing unit for the number of people who will live in the house, duplex, or apartment.






A family who is issued a housing voucher must find housing where the owner agrees to rent under the voucher program—and the rental unit must meet standards of health and safety that are determined by the public housing agency (PHA).



The vouchers are administered by local public housing agencies (PHAs) that are funded by HUD. The PHA pays the subsidy directly to the landlord on behalf of the tenant, and the tenant pays the difference between the actual rent charged by the landlord and the amount subsidized by the program. HUD states that to be eligible for the voucher program, the tenant’s income may not exceed 50% of the median income for the area.



Families can move from one housing unit to another because of income changes, job status, or the addition of family members. The voucher program attempts to allow for mobility without losing housing benefits. Beneficiaries with vouchers sign leases with property owners that have this program. With subsidized housing, residents sign leases with property managers who oversee federally owned projects.


  The Office of Public and Indian Housing  

The Office of Public and Indian Housing (PIH) exists to ensure access to safe, decent, and affordable housing. The PIH also works to create opportunities to help residents become self-sufficient and economically independent.



HUD established its office of Public Housing to help provide safe and decent rental housing for eligible low-income families as well as the elderly and people with disabilities. This includes access to single-family homes as well as housing in multi-unit properties. An estimated 1.2 million households live in public housing units that are managed by entities overseen by HUD.


  The Office of Community Planning and Development  

The Office of Community Planning and Development (CPD) works to develop viable communities by promoting integrated approaches in providing decent housing, suitable living environments, and expanding economic opportunities for low and moderate-income individuals and households. The Office achieves this goal by developing partnerships among the government and private sector organizations, including those that operate on a for-profit and non-profit basis.


  The Office of Policy Development and Research  

The Office of Policy Development and Research supports HUD's efforts to create cohesive and economically viable communities by maintaining up-to-date information on:



Housing needsMarket conditionsExisting housing programs



The office is also tasked with conducting research on priority housing and community development issues. The data generated is then used to help inform HUD policy decisions.





Tip

HUD User is an online informational resource for academics, researchers, policymakers, and the American public.


  The Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity  

The Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity (FHEO) exists to "eliminate housing discrimination, promote economic opportunity, and achieve diverse, inclusive communities by leading the nation in the enforcement, administration, development, and public understanding of federal fair housing policies and laws."



As stated on their website, some of the laws that FHEO implements and enforces include:



The Fair Housing ActTitle VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964Section 109 of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973Titles II and III of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990The Architectural Barriers Act of 1968The Age Discrimination Act of 1975Title IX of the Education Amendments Act of 1972



FHEO is also responsible for investigating fair housing complaints, conducting compliance reviews, ensuring civil rights in HUD programs, and managing fair housing grants.


  Ginnie Mae  

Ginnie Mae makes affordable housing a reality for low- and moderate-income households by helping to funnel capital into the housing market. The Ginnie Mae guaranty program allows mortgage lenders to get a better price for loans in the secondary mortgage market. Lenders can use the proceeds to fund new loans, which enables the mortgage market to maintain liquidity.



Ginnie Mae doesn't buy or sell loans or issue mortgage-backed securities. But it does guarantee investors the timely payment of interest and principal on mortgage-backed securities that are backed by federally insured or guaranteed loans.





Note

Ginnie Mae has never been the recipient of a government bailout.


  Other programs  

HUD oversees a number of other programs and offices, including:



Office of Economic DevelopmentOffice of Hearings and AppealsHealthy Homes and Lead Hazard ControlPublic AffairsOffice of the Inspector General



Each of these programs and offices play a different role in ensuring fair and equal access to housing.




What Does the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development Do?
The Department of Housing and Urban Development is responsible for administering programs that provide housing and community development assistance, while also ensuring access to fair and equal housing for all.  




Are Fannie Mae and HUD the Same Thing?
Fannie Mae is a government-sponsored enterprise that is a leading source of conventional mortgage financing in the U.S. This entity is separate from HUD and performs a different function within the mortgage market.




Does HUD Make Loans?
HUD does not offer home loans directly. Instead, the Department of Housing and Urban Development works with a network of approved partner lenders to help homebuyers get the financing they need to purchase homes.




How Do You Qualify for a HUD Loan?
Qualification for a mortgage loan offered through a HUD program is based on many of the same requirements associated with non-HUD loans. That includes meeting minimum credit score and income guidelines, having a debt-to-income ratio within acceptable limits, and meeting the down payment requirements.


   Bottom Line  

The Department of Housing and Urban Development serves an important role in ensuring that homebuyers are able to secure mortgage loans. FHA loans, for example, can make it easier to buy a home with a smaller down payment and/or a lower credit score. These types of mortgage options help to make homeownership more accessible overall.
What Is the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs?  

The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs was the name given to the previous Veterans Administration when it was elevated to a Cabinet-level executive department in 1988. This move, which took effect in 1989, gave the department a new name that allowed it to still be referred to by its longtime initials, the VA.



The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs has three administrations: the Veterans Health Administration (VHA), the Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA), and the National Cemetery Administration (NCA). It provides medical care, benefits, and a variety of essential services to veterans of the U.S. armed forces and their families.





Key Takeaways

The U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs comprises three administrations: the Veterans Health Administration (VHA), the Veterans Benefits Administration (VBA), and the National Cemetery Administration (NCA).Also known as the VA, the Department of Veterans Affairs provides near-comprehensive healthcare services, as well as disability compensation, vocational rehabilitation, education assistance, home loans, and life insurance.It also provides burial and memorial benefits to eligible veterans and family members.


   Understanding the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs  

The Department of Veterans Affairs provides near-comprehensive healthcare services to eligible military veterans at medical centers and outpatient clinics. It also offers several non-healthcare benefits including disability compensation, vocational rehabilitation, education assistance, home loans, and life insurance. In addition, the department provides burial and memorial benefits to eligible veterans and family members at national cemeteries.



Like many other organizations, the Department of Veterans Affairs follows a mission statement, which is "to care for him who shall have borne the battle, and for his widow, and his orphan." The values that the department follows match its mission. It has five values, which go by the acronym "I CARE": integrity, commitment, advocacy, respect, and excellence. These values are intended to provide a baseline for the standards of behavior expected of all the department's employees.



Below, details about its three administrations: the VHA, the VBA, and the NCA.


   Veterans Health Administration  

The VHA evolved from the first federal soldier's facility established for veterans of the Union Army after the Civil War. It was later joined by a system of veterans hospitals, clinics, and nursing homes.



The VHA is the largest integrated healthcare system in the United States. It includes 1,293 healthcare facilities, 171 VA medical centers, and 1,112 outpatient sites. It serves more than 9 million veterans enrolled in the VA healthcare program. VHA medical centers provide a wide variety of medical services to eligible veterans ranging from surgery to rehabilitative care.






To receive healthcare benefits, the VA requires that you be a military veteran or former member of the National Guard or Reserve who served on active duty and was not dishonorably discharged. Specific eligibility depends on when you served and for how long.


   Veterans Benefits Administration  

The VBA provides a variety of benefits and services that deliver financial assistance and other forms of help to service members, their dependents, and survivors. The list includes disability compensation, education and training, life insurance, vocational rehabilitation, and job placement assistance.



The VBA also overseas the VA home loan program. VA loans are backed by the government and offer up to 100% financing on the value of a home, among other benefits.


   National Cemetery Administration  

The NCA runs 155 national cemeteries across the country and Puerto Rico, providing benefits for all eligible service members and family members. Burial and memorial benefits include opening and closing of the grave, perpetual care, a burial flag, a headstone/marker, and a presidential memorial certificate.





$245 billion

The amount of the 2021 annual budget for the Department of Veterans Affairs.


   History of the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs  

The beginning of the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs dates back to 1636 when the Pilgrims of Plymouth Colony voted that the colony would support soldiers disabled by its war with the Native American tribe called the Pequot. During the Revolutionary War, the Continental Congress of 1776 enacted pensions for disabled soldiers. In the 19th century, support was extended to the widows and dependents of veterans.



Veterans' benefits expanded during World War I, with the first consolidation of World War I veterans' programs occurring in 1921 when Congress created the Veterans Bureau. In 1930, President Herbert Hoover elevated the Bureau to a federal administration. In 1988, President Ronald Reagan further promoted the VA to Cabinet level. The change took effect in 1989, and the VA adopted the new title of the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs.



The current head of the VA is Denis Richard McDonough. He was nominated by the Biden administration and sworn in as the secretary of Veterans Affairs in February 2021.
What Is the U.S. Dollar Index (USDX)?  

The U.S. dollar index (USDX) is a measure of the value of the U.S. dollar relative to a basket of foreign currencies. The USDX was established by the U.S. Federal Reserve in 1973 after the dissolution of the Bretton Woods Agreement. It is now maintained by ICE Data Indices, a subsidiary of the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE).



The six currencies included in the USDX are often referred to as America's most significant trading partners, but the index has only been updated once: in 1999 when the euro replaced the German mark, French franc, Italian lira, Dutch guilder, and Belgian franc. Consequently, the index does not accurately reflect present-day U.S. trade.





Key Takeaways

The U.S. Dollar Index is used to measure the value of the dollar against a basket of six foreign currencies.These are: the Euro, Swiss franc, Japanese yen, Canadian dollar, British pound, and Swedish krona.The index was established shortly after the Bretton Woods Agreement dissolved in 1973 with a base of 100, and values since then are relative to this base.The value of the index is a fair indication of the dollar’s value in global markets.


   Understanding the U.S. Dollar Index (USDX)  

The index is currently calculated by factoring in the exchange rates of six foreign currencies, which include the euro (EUR), Japanese yen (JPY), Canadian dollar (CAD), British pound (GBP), Swedish krona (SEK), and Swiss franc (CHF).



The euro is, by far, the largest component of the index, making up 57.6% of the basket. The weights of the rest of the currencies in the index are JPY (13.6%), GBP (11.9%), CAD (9.1%), SEK (4.2%), and CHF (3.6%).



The index started in 1973 with a base of 100, and values since then are relative to this base. It was established shortly after the Bretton Woods Agreement was dissolved. As part of the agreement, participating countries settled their balances in U.S. dollars (which was used as the reserve currency), while the USD was fully convertible to gold at a rate of $35/ounce. 



An overvaluation of the USD led to concerns over the exchange rates and their link to the way in which gold was priced. President Richard Nixon decided to temporarily suspend the gold standard, at which point other countries were able to choose any exchange agreement other than the price of gold. In 1973, many foreign governments chose to let their currency rates float, putting an end to the agreement.


   History of the U.S. Dollar Index (USDX)  

The U.S. Dollar Index has risen and fallen sharply throughout its history. It reached an all-time high in 1984 at nearly 165. Its all-time low was nearly 70 in 2007. Over the last several years, the U.S. dollar index has been relatively rangebound between 90 and 110.



The index is affected by macroeconomic factors, including inflation/deflation in the dollar and foreign currencies included in the comparable basket, as well as recessions and economic growth in those countries.



The contents of the basket of currencies have only been changed once since the index started when the euro replaced many European currencies previously in the index in 1999, such as Germany's predecessor currency, the Deutschemark.



In the coming years, it is likely currencies will be replaced as the index strives to represent major U.S. trading partners. It is likely in the future that currencies such as the Chinese yuan (CNY) and Mexican peso (MXN) will supplant other currencies in the index due to China and Mexico being major trading partners with the U.S.






The USDX uses a fixed weighting scheme based on exchange rates in 1973 that heavily weights the euro. As a result, expect to see big moves in the fund in response to euro movements. 


   Interpreting the USDX  

An index value of 120 suggests that the U.S. dollar has appreciated 20% versus the basket of currencies over the time period in question. Simply put, if the USDX goes up, that means the U.S. dollar is gaining strength or value when compared to the other currencies.



Similarly, if the index is currently 80, falling 20 from its initial value, that implies that it has depreciated 20%. The appreciation and depreciation results are a factor of the time period in question.






   How to Trade the USDX  

The U.S. dollar index allows traders to monitor the value of the USD compared to a basket of select currencies in a single transaction. It also allows them to hedge their bets against any risks with respect to the dollar. It is possible to incorporate futures or options strategies on the USDX.



These financial products currently trade on the New York Board of Trade. Investors can use the index to hedge general currency moves or speculate. The index is also available indirectly as part of exchange-traded funds (ETFs) or mutual funds.



For instance, the Invesco DB U.S. Dollar Index Bullish Fund (UUP) is an ETF that tracks the changes in value of the US dollar via USDX future contracts. The Wisdom Tree Bloomberg U.S. Dollar Bullish Fund (USDU) is an actively-managed ETF that goes long the U.S. dollar against a basket of developed and emerging market currencies.



Invesco DB also offers its U.S. Dollar Index Bearish Fund (UDN), which shorts the dollar, gaining in value when the dollar weakens.




What Does the Dollar Index Tell You?
The dollar index tracks the relative value of the U.S. dollar against a basket of important world currencies. If the index is rising, it means that the dollar is strengthening against the basket - and vice-versa.




What Currencies Are in the USDX Basket?
The USDX tracks the dollar's (USD) relative strength against a basket of foreign currencies. The weightings have been fixed since 1973 (and later adjusted in 2002 when the euro replaced many European currencies):Euro (EUR) - 57.6% weightJapanese yen (JPY) - 13.6%Pound sterling (GBP) - 11.9%Canadian dollar (CAD) - 9.1%Swedish krona (SEK) - 4.2%Swiss franc (CHF) - 3.6%




How Do You Calculate the USDX Index Price?
The USDX is based on a basket of six currencies with different weightings (see above). The index calculation is simply the weighted average of the U.S. dollar exchange rates against these currencies, normalized by an indexing factor (which is ~50.1435).USDX = 50.14348112 × EURUSD^-0.576 × USDJPY^0.136 × GBPUSD^-0.119 × USDCAD^0.091 × USDSEK^0.042 × USDCHF^0.036


   The Bottom Line  

The U.S. Dollar Index (USDX) is a relative measure of the U.S. dollars (USD) strength against a basket of six influential currencies, including the Euro, Pound, Yen, Canadian Dollar, Swedish Korner, and Swiss Franc. The index was created in 1973, but remains useful to this day. The USDX can be used as a proxy for the health of the U.S. economy and traders can use it to speculate on the dollar's change in value or as a hedge against currency exposure elsewhere.
What Is the U.S. House Financial Services Committee?  

The U.S. House Financial Services Committee is the congressional committee responsible for monitoring and writing legislation for the financial services and housing-related industries in the United States. All committee members are elected members of the U.S. House of Representatives.



Members of the committee oversee the government’s financial aid to industry and commerce, international finance, the insurance industry, securities and exchanges, urban development, and more.﻿﻿



There are 60 congressional members on the committee, the majority of whom are republicans. The current chairwoman of the committee is Maxine Waters, a Democrat congresswoman from California. Patrick McHenry, a Republican from North Carolina, is the ranking member of the committee.﻿﻿


   Understanding the U.S. House Financial Services Committee  

The House Financial Services Committee also has oversight over several important federal departments, such as the Department of the Treasury and the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, the Federal Reserve and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. It also has oversight over government-sponsored entities (GSEs) such as Fannie Mae (Federal National Mortgage Association) and Freddie Mac (Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation).﻿﻿



The U.S. government created the committee in 1865 to take over responsibilities previously held by the Ways and Means Committee. At that time, it was known as the Committee on Banking and Currency. It was renamed the House Financial Services Committee in 1968.﻿﻿


   The Committee’s Work Today  

In 2018, the committee has several issues at the center of its focus. One is replacing the Dodd-Frank Act. This act, signed into law by Barack Obama, brought sweeping new regulation and oversight to the banking industry in the wake of the financial crisis of 2008. Statements issued by the committee call for the replacement of the bill in order to lift regulations and make it easier for Americans to procure home mortgages, start small businesses and access bank services such as free checking.



Another issue that the committee is focused on is bringing more oversight and transparency to the Federal Reserve, the central bank of the United States. The committee has finalized and introduced a bill to this effect, though it has not yet been passed into law.



The committee also aims to crack down on waste of tax dollars, abuse of power and fraud within all federal programs under its jurisdiction. Toward this end, it has created an accessible way for citizens to confidentially report on any of these things directly to the committee.



As recently as May 2018, the committee has also held hearings focused on fighting money laundering, examining the current state of homelessness in America and studying the impact that driverless cars may have on the auto insurance industry in the U.S.
What Is the USMCA?  

The United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, also known as the USMCA, is a trade deal between the three nations which was signed on Nov. 30, 2018. The USMCA replaced the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), which had been in effect since January of 1994. Under the terms of NAFTA, tariffs on many goods passing between North America's three major economic powers were gradually phased out. By 2008, tariffs on various agricultural and textiles products, automobiles, and other goods were reduced or eliminated.





Key Takeaways

The United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) is a free trade agreement between those three countries.The USMCA replaced the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).The USMCA took effect on July 1, 2020.If not renewed, the USMCA will expire in 2036, 16 years after it took effect.


   USMCA History  

The USMCA was negotiated under the Trump Administration, but the idea of a replacement for NAFTA dates back to before President Trump's presidential term. Over the years, NAFTA has frequently been blamed for the export of U.S. manufacturing to Mexico and the accompanying loss of jobs and suppression of wages among U.S. workers. In 2008, then-presidential candidate Obama had pledged to renegotiate NAFTA in the interests of American workers but later declined to do so during his administration.



As a candidate in the 2016 election, President Trump campaigned on renegotiating NAFTA to try and get more favorable terms for the U.S. The USMCA began to officially take shape when the Trump administration sent the required 90-day notice to Congress that he would begin talks to renegotiate NAFTA. The talks officially began on August 16, 2017, and ended on September 30, 2018.



First, the Mexican Senate ratified the deal on June 19, 2019, and approved amendments to it on December 12, 2019. Then, on December 19, 2019, the U.S. House of Representatives passed legislation to approve the USMCA. The legislation passed the Senate in January 16, 2020, and on January 29, President Trump signed it into law. Finally, the Canadian Parliament ratified the treaty on March 13, 2020.



Several difficulties emerged before and shortly after the treaty went into effect on July 1, 2020. First, on May 31, 2019, President Trump said starting June 10, the U.S. would impose a 5% tariff on all Mexican imports. He threatened this increase in tariffs unless the Mexican government took sterner measures to lower the number of Central American asylum seekers entering the U.S. from Mexico. A deal was reached to avoid the tariffs on June 8, 2020.



On August 6, 2020, President Trump announced he would reinstate tariffs on Canadian aluminum, which had originally been put in place in 2018. The Canadian government responded, saying it was planning to place equal tariffs on U.S. aluminum products. On October 27, the same day the Canadian government was expected to unveil its retaliatory trade measures, President Trump suspended the tariffs, retroactively through September 1. However, the office of the U.S. Trade Representative said that the U.S. might reinstate the tariffs if aluminum imports from Canada "exceed 105 percent of the expected volume in any month".


   Important Provisions of the USMCA  

Per the Office of the United States Trade Representative, the USMCA is a "mutually beneficial win for North American workers, farmers, ranchers, and businesses." NAFTA aimed to create a free trade zone between the U.S., Canada, and Mexico, and the USMCA utilizes NAFTA as a basis for a new agreement. While the USMCA has a broad impact on trade of all kinds between the three named nations, some of the agreement's most important provisions include the following:


  Dairy and Agriculture  

The USMCA will increase U.S. farmers' access to the Canadian dairy market by raising the amount of U.S. goods that can be exported to Canada tariff-free. This will allow the U.S. tariff-free access to up to 3.6% of the Canadian dairy market. The amount of tariff-free exports allowed for some poultry products will also be expanded.


  Automobiles  

One of the most significant portions of the USMCA stipulates new trade regulations for automobiles and automotive parts. Under NAFTA, cars and trucks with at least 62.5% of their components manufactured in one of the three participating countries could be sold free of tariffs. The USMCA increases that minimum requirement to 75%. At the same time, the USMCA stipulates minimum wages for workers in the automotive manufacturing process: 40-45% of the work done on eligible vehicles must be accomplished by workers earning at least $16 (USD) per hour.


  Intellectual Property  

The USMCA increases intellectual property protections. Among other changes to trade policy, the new agreement extends the copyright period to 70 years beyond the life of the creator, an increase of 20 years in some cases. The USMCA also addresses new products that weren't around when NAFTA was written in the early 1990s. The USMCA prohibits tariffs on digital music, e-books, and other similar digital products. The agreement also establishes copyright safe harbor for internet companies, meaning they can't be held liable for copyright infringements of their users if they make good faith efforts to stop infringement.


  Sunset Provision  

Unlike NAFTA, the USMCA is set to expire after 16 years unless it is renewed. All three nations are required to come together for a joint review every 6 years. The agreement is not automatically terminated if one party refuses to renew it at one of these joint reviews. Instead, the nations are required to meet every year for the following 10 years to resolve the issues blocking renewal. The agreement expires if no agreement is reached in those 10 years.


  Labor  

The USMCA sets up an independent investigatory panel that can investigate factories accused of violating workers' rights, and stop shipments from factories found to be in violation of labor laws. In addition, Mexico says it will enact a wide array of labor reforms to make it easier for workers to unionize, and stop violence and other abuses of workers. These provisions are meant to achieve two goals: to improving working conditions for Mexico's workers and create a more even playing field between U.S. and Mexican factories because Mexican wages are likely to rise.
What Are U.S. Savings Bonds?  

A U.S. savings bond is a government bond offered to its citizens to help fund federal spending, and which provides savers with a guaranteed, although modest, return. These bonds are issued with zero coupon at a discount with an implied fixed rate of interest over a fixed period of time.



For instance, Series EE savings bonds are sold at 50% of their face value, and mature to their full value after 20 years.





Key Takeaways


U.S. savings bonds are a form of government debt issued to American citizens to help fund federal expenditures.
Savings bonds are sold at a discount and mature to their full face value, and do not pay regular coupon interest.
Series EE bonds are sold at half of face value and mature in 20 years. Series I bonds are adjusted for inflation.



   Understanding U.S. Savings Bonds  

A U.S. savings bond is a common type of government bond, which is a bond issued by a governmental body to raise funds from the public to fund its capital projects and other operations necessary to manage the economy. When the government sells bonds, it is in effect taking a loan from the public, which it promises to pay back at some predetermined date in the future. As compensation for providing it with capital, the government makes interest payments to its bondholders. 



Many people find these bonds attractive because they are not subject to state or local income taxes. These bonds cannot easily be transferred and are non-negotiable.


   History of the U.S. Savings Bond  

In 1935, during the Great Depression, President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed legislation that allowed the U.S. Department of the Treasury to issue federally backed savings bonds, Series A. In 1941, the Series E bond was first issued to help finance World War II and were called Defensive Bonds. After the attack on Pearl Harbor, they were called War Savings Bonds, and the money invested in them went directly toward the war effort.



After the war ended, Americans were encouraged to purchase savings bonds, which provided a way for individuals and families to earn returns on their investments while enjoying the absolute guarantee of the United States government. 


   Features of U.S. Savings Bonds  

Non-Marketable: The U.S. savings bond was designed to be non-marketable, meaning that an investor can only purchase the bond directly from the U.S. government and cannot sell it to any other investor. The bond, in effect, cannot be transferred, as it represents a contract between the investor and the U.S. government. This direct relationship ensures that the U.S. savings bond does not fluctuate in value. Therefore, an investor would receive their original investment if they redeemed the bond. Furthermore, any lost or damaged savings bond certificate can be reissued or replaced, since the bond is registered with the government.
Purchase: An investor can buy the bonds in penny increments with a minimum investment value of $25 and a maximum value of $10,000. A bond investor cannot buy more than $10,000 face value of U.S. savings bonds in a calendar year. U.S. savings bonds can only be purchased and redeemed electronically through the TreasuryDirect website administered by the government. The investor must open a TreasuryDirect account and provide a Social Security Number (SSN), checking or savings account, and email address.
Interest payment: U.S. savings bonds are zero-coupon bonds that do not pay interest until they are redeemed or until the maturity date. The interest compounds semi-annually and accrues every year for 30 years. After a bond has been held for 30 years, it will no longer generate interest payments to the investor. An investor who purchases the bond at the end of the month will still receive the interest accrued for the entire month. Any interest paid at redemption or maturity date is issued electronically to the bondholder’s designated bank account.
Early redemption: The time it takes for a bond to mature varies, but it is often between 15 and 30 years. A bondholder must wait at least 12 months after the initial purchase before redeeming the savings bond, at which point they will receive the face value plus interest. Furthermore, investors who redeem the bonds within the first five years of purchase will forfeit the last three months’ interest as a penalty. However, redeeming a bond after holding it for five years does not incur any penalty.
Tax consequences: The interest earned from savings bonds is exempt from state and local income taxes. However, federal taxes apply, but only in the year in which the bond matures, is redeemed, or after 30 years, when the bond stops earning interest. If the investor uses the proceeds from the bond redemption to pay tuition for higher education, they may be exempt from higher taxes.


   Types of U.S. Savings Bonds  

There are presently two types of U.S. savings bonds that can be purchased electronically are the Series EE and Series I bonds.



Series EE U.S. Savings Bond: The Series EE savings bond replaced the Series E bond in 1980. These bonds are sold at face value and are worth their full value upon redemption. These bonds offer a fixed rate of interest, which is paid at maturity or redemption.
Series I U.S. Savings Bond: The Series I savings bond was introduced in 1998. Like the Series EE bond, the Series I is sold at face value. These bonds offer a rate of interest adjusted for inflation, making the interest rate somewhat variable. If inflation increases, the interest rate on the savings bond will be adjusted upward. During periods of deflation, the bonds are guaranteed never to drop below 0.00%.
Series HH bonds are no longer available for purchase. The U.S. government discontinued these bonds as of Aug. 31, 2004. Bonds that didn't mature continued to receive interest payments. The Series HH bond were 20-year, non-marketable savings bond issued by the U.S. government.


   Other Considerations  

In order to purchase or redeem a U.S. savings bond, an investor must be a U.S. citizen, official U.S. resident, or U.S. government employee (regardless of citizenship status).



U.S. savings bonds are among the safest types of investments, as they are endorsed by the federal government and are, therefore, risk-free. Although these bonds do not earn much interest compared to the stock market, they do offer a less volatile source of income. They offer a way to save for future expenditures, as they cannot be cashed until at least 12 months after purchase, and the longer you wait to cash the bond, the more interest it accrues.
How Are Savings Bonds Taxed?  

According to Treasury Direct, interest from EE U.S. savings bonds is taxed at the federal level but not at the state or local levels for income. Bonds typically earn interest, which is the amount that a bond can be redeemed for above its face value. The face value is the bond's original purchase price. The interest on savings bonds is also subject to federal gift, estate, and excise taxes. On the state level, the tax on the interest applies for estates or inheritances.﻿﻿

   Understanding How Savings Bonds Are Taxed  

The ownership of the bond governs who is responsible for paying tax on the interest. If one person purchases the bond and is the sole owner for the life of the bond, that person owes the taxes on the interest. If a child is the sole owner, a parent may report the interest on the bond and pay the taxes on the parent's tax return.﻿﻿



However, there are ownership situations whereby the tax responsibility can vary. The taxes on interest for U.S. savings bonds are outlined under the section, tax considerations, on the Treasury Direct website.﻿﻿



Below are some of the ownership scenarios that can impact who pays the taxes on the interest for a savings bond. Please note that the tax rates can change depending on the policies of the U.S. Treasury and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). Please consult a tax professional for your specific tax situation.


  Another Owner Added by Purchaser  

If one person purchases the bond and adds another person to the bond as co-owner whereby that person remains co-owner for the life of the bond, the purchaser is responsible for the taxes.﻿﻿



If one person purchases the bond and lists another person as the sole owner of the bond, the person listed as the owner is responsible for the interest.﻿﻿


  Proportional Ownership  

If two people split the purchase price of the bond, each person is responsible for the proportion of the taxes that represents the proportion of the ownership stake in the bond. For instance, if Jim and Bill purchase a $1,000 bond with Jim paying $400 and Bill paying $600, Jim is responsible for 40% of the taxes, and Bill is responsible for 60% of the taxes.﻿﻿


  Exception to the Proportional Ownership Rule  

The exception to the proportional rule is for spouses who live in community property states and who are each responsible for half of the taxes if they file their taxes separately. Taxes may also be split if there is a succession of ownership. When a bond changes hands, the owners are each responsible only for the taxes on the portion of the interest that accrued during each period of ownership.﻿﻿



So, if Jill owned a bond from 2003 to 2007 before relinquishing it to Amy, who has owned it since, Jill must pay the taxes on the interest accrued between 2003 and 2007, and Amy must pay the taxes on interest earned after 2007.


   Reporting the Interest for Taxes  

Owners can wait to pay the taxes when they cash in the bond, when the bond matures, or when they relinquish the bond to another owner. Alternatively, they may pay the taxes yearly as interest accrues. Most owners choose to defer the taxes until they redeem the bond.



A bond that has reached maturity and stopped earning interest is automatically considered redeemed, and the interest amount is reported to the Internal Revenue Service. The income is interest income and is reported on a 1099-INT, and the owner includes it on the yearly tax return.



If an owner decides to report the interest income yearly, the income from that bond and all other savings bonds for the same owner must continue to be reported yearly. The interest still accrues, in this case, and is not received. Once the bond reaches maturity, the owner must let the IRS know that the interest has been paid yearly.



Investopedia does not provide tax, investment, or financial services and advice. The information is presented without consideration of the investment objectives, risk tolerance, or financial circumstances of any specific investor and might not be suitable for all investors. Investing involves risk, including the possible loss of principal. Investors should consider engaging a qualified financial professional to determine a suitable investment strategy.
What Is the U.S. Treasury?  

The U.S. Treasury, created in 1789, is the government department responsible for issuing all Treasury bonds, notes, and bills. Among the government departments operating under the U.S. Treasury umbrella are the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), the U.S. Mint, the Bureau of the Fiscal Service, and the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau.



Key functions of the U.S. Treasury include printing bills, postage, and Federal Reserve notes, minting coins, collecting taxes, enforcing tax laws, managing all government accounts and debt issues, and overseeing U.S. banks in cooperation with the Federal Reserve. The secretary of the Treasury is responsible for international monetary and financial policy, including foreign exchange intervention.





Key Takeaways

The U.S. Treasury is a government department in charge of managing all federal finances.It is responsible for collecting taxes, paying bills, managing currency, government accounts, and public debt.The Department of the Treasury enforces finance and tax laws, as well as issues treasury bonds, considered to be the safest and most liquid securities worldwide.Janet Yellen, former chair of the Federal Reserve, is the current Treasury secretary. She is the first woman to hold either position.


   Understanding the U.S. Treasury  

The U.S. Treasury is the Cabinet-level department responsible for promoting economic growth and security. It was established by the First Congress of the United States, which convened in New York on March 4, 1789, following the ratification of the Constitution. The secretary of the Treasury is nominated by the president and must be confirmed by the U.S. Senate.


   Establishment  

The U.S. Constitution was ratified in 1788, replacing the Articles of Confederation, under which the U.S. had functioned during and immediately following the American Revolution. The Constitution provided for a much stronger federal government, and the establishment of a centralized Treasury Department was an important part of that.



Alexander Hamilton was the first secretary of the Treasury and served until 1795. Among his major accomplishments while he was secretary of the Treasury were the federal government's assumption of the states' debts related to the American Revolution, provisions for the payment of war bonds, and the institution of a system for the collection of federal taxes.


   Internal Revenue Service  

In 1861, President Abraham Lincoln implemented an income tax to pay for the Civil War and in 1862, he created the position of commissioner of internal revenue. That tax was repealed in 1872, but the office lived on. The income tax as it exists now began with the 1913 ratification of the 16th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, and the IRS assumed responsibility for collection and enforcement.


   Treasury Bills and Bonds  

Borrowing by the Treasury is done through the issuance of shorter-term notes, called bills, and longer-term bonds. The bonds have a maturity of as long as 30 years. Treasury bonds are backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government, and as such are popular investments by governments, companies, and individuals worldwide.



The Federal Reserve Bank buys and sells the bills and bonds to control the country's money supply and manage interest rates.


   Who Runs the Treasury Department?  

The Treasury Department is headed by the secretary of the Treasury who is nominated by the president and confirmed by the Senate. Janet Yellen is the Treasury Secretary in the Biden–Harris administration. Yellen was previously the chair of the Federal Reserve from 2014–2018. She is the first woman to hold either position.



Yellen's top deputy at the Treasury Department is Adewale "Wally" Adeyemo. He is a veteran of the Obama administration and an expert on macroeconomic policy and consumer protection with national security experience.
What is Usance  

In international trade, usance is the allowable period of time, permitted by custom, between the date of the bill and its payment. The usance of a bill varies between countries, often ranging from two weeks to two months. It is also the interest charged on borrowed funds. Usance is derived from the action of usury, as well as the use of goods for economic purposes.


   BREAKING DOWN Usance  

Usance applies to many items purchased on credit. For example, a company that purchases materials from a supplier will receive the goods today. The bill will be delivered today, but the company might have up to 30 days to pay it. The 30 days represents the usance for the sale.



When a person lends money, they will charge a usance in exchange for the service. In this case, usance relates to the profits made from the lending of principal.



Usance is the process of using goods to fulfill economic needs. This involves refining materials into finished goods or the consumption of goods to satisfy needs.

What Does USD Stand for?  

The USD is the currency abbreviation for the U.S. dollar ($), the official currency of the United States of America and the world's primary reserve currency over the past several decades. It is managed by the Federal Reserve, America's central bank.



In foreign exchange (forex) markets, the USD is the most common pairing in exchange with other currencies; for instance, EUR/USD, USD/JPY, and GBP/USD. The U.S. dollar is also the official currency for a small number of other nations such as The Marshall Islands, Panama and Ecuador, and is unofficially accepted in local exchange in several other countries around the world.





Key Takeaways

USD is the three-letter abbreviation for the U.S. dollar.The USD is the legal tender currency of the United States, and also serves as a global reserve currency in international trade and financial markets.The USD was once based on the gold standard but has been a free-floating fiat currency since 1971.USD is the most traded currency in the international foreign exchange market, with the EUR/USD the most active currency pair.USD accounts for approximately almost 90% of all foreign exchange transactions,


   Understanding the USD  

The USD is the currency of the United States and is denoted by the symbol '$'. One dollar can be divided into one hundred cents. Dollar banknotes are currently issued in denominations of $1, $2, $5, $10, $20, $50, and $100. Each feature the portrait of a president on the front (with the exception of the $100 bill, which depicts Benjamin Franklin)—and the $20 bill may soon feature abolitionist Harriet Tubman on its front.



Notably, $500 and $1,000 banknotes used to circulate in limited amounts but ceased in 1969. Coins are minted in denominations of $0.01 (cent), $0.05 (nickel), $0.10 (dime), $0.25 (quarter), $0.50 (half dollar), and $1.00. Banknotes and coins are produced by the Treasury Department and shipped directly to Federal Reserve banks and branches for distribution and circulation.



The USD is the most traded currency in the international foreign exchange market, which facilitates global currency exchange and is the largest financial market in the world, with a daily average volume for May 2022 of nearly $1.2 trillion. As such, the USD is considered a benchmark currency and is readily accepted in transactions worldwide.





88%

The USD accounts for approximately 88% of all foreign exchange transactions according to the Bank for International Settlements' (BIS) 2019 triennial report.


   A Brief History of the USD  

The USD has been the official currency of the United States since the passage of the National Currency Act of 1785. Before that, the United States used a patchwork system of unreliable continental currency, British pounds, and various foreign currencies. At first, the dollar was denominated only in coins, with paper currency introduced in 1861, and its value was keyed to the relative prices of gold, silver, and copper.



Various acts of Congress modified the USD's design, value, and underlying commodities until the currency's oversight was formalized with the Federal Reserve Act of 1913. After this reform, the dollar was technically a Federal Reserve note, redeemable on demand for an equivalent value of precious metals at any of the Federal Reserve banks or the U.S. Mint.



U.S. dollars ceased to be redeemable with the de facto abandonment of the gold standard in 1933, when President Franklin D. Roosevelt prohibited the private ownership of gold. In 1944, the Bretton Woods Agreement effectively forced all of the major currencies of the world to convert from a precious metal-based value system to one of the fixed exchange rates, with governments allowed to sell gold to the United States for $35 an ounce, payable only in U.S. dollars. The gold standard was formally abandoned in 1971, when the Bretton Woods exchange rates were abandoned.



Today, the USD is a free-floating currency on global forex markets. In the post-Bretton Woods world, the U.S. dollar acts as the reserve currency of most countries. Instead of stockpiling gold and silver, the central banks of the world keep a steady reserve of dollars as a hedge against inflation.






Dollar bills sometimes go by the slang "greenbacks" in reference to the green-colored ink that is characteristic of their reverse side.


   Measuring the USD Value  

The value of the USD is broadly measured by the U.S. Dollar Index (USDX), which is comprised of a basket of currencies affiliated with the major trading partners of the United States. These include the euro (57.6% of the Index), the Japanese yen (13.6%), the British pound (11.9%), the Canadian dollar (9.1%), the Swedish krona (4.2%), and the Swiss franc (3.6%). The index goes up when the dollar gains strength against other currencies and falls when it weakens.



Within the United States, the amount of dollars in existence is measured by one of the several money-supply (money stock) metrics put out by the Fed. The monetary base, or M0, is the aggregate total amount of dollars in circulation in the form of cash (banknote and coin). As the monetary base increases, the fractional reserve banking system expands the money supply via the money multiplier effect.


   Advantages of the USD  

Several factors work to make the USD attractive as a reserve currency and in exchange, but the dollar's long-standing price stability might be the most important. Unlike some other major currencies, the USD to date has never been devalued to handle the country's debt or seen bouts of hyperinflation.



Moreover, no U.S. dollar has ever been dishonored or refused as legal tender, which vastly increases confidence in the soundness of the currency. As a result, the USD is used to denominate financial, debt, and commodity transactions all over the world.



Because of its strength and stability, many foreign governments and central banks hold onto U.S. dollar reserves to help keep their own economy and local currency stable. This may be in the form of actual USD currency holdings, or (more commonly) as U.S. Treasury bonds.


   Example of USD: Petrodollars  

A good example of the USD in terms of international trade and as a reserve currency is in the global market for crude oil. Much of the world's oil and gas is produced overseas, in the Middle East, Russia, Norway, South America, and elsewhere. The global oil market, however, is priced in dollars per barrel. USD paid for oil to non-U.S. exporters are known as "petrodollars", which becomes a primary source of revenue for these nations.



Because those nations do not use USD as their primary currency, they develop reserves of dollars that must be recycled or spent in order to convert them into local currency. Forex markets are a primary channel for this, as well as the purchase of U.S. Treasuries to hold in reserves.


   USD FAQs  
  How Much USD Is in Circulation?  

According to the Federal Reserve, as of July 2022, there is just over $2 trillion worth of USD currency in circulation. This number swells to more than $21.6 trillion if you look at the M2 measure of the money supply, which includes non-cash items like money market instruments, deposits, and other credit money.


  How Many U.S. Dollars Does It Take to Buy 1 Euro?  

As of July 2022, the EUR/USD exchange rate is 1.02, which means that one euro (EUR) is equal to USD $1.02. Alternatively, you can say that one dollar is equal to Є0.99. The EUR/USD currency pair is often the most actively traded in forex markets.


  What Is USDCoin?  

USDCoin (USDC) is a stablecoin that is pegged to the value of $1 USD—the price as of July 30, 2022 is $0.95. A stablecoin is a class of cryptocurrency that derives its value from some external reference. USDCoin is not issued or managed by the U.S. government or Federal Reserve as is not considered legal tender in exchange.
What Is USDA Streamlined Refinancing?  

USDA streamlined refinancing refers to a simplified mortgage-refinancing option offered through the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). USDA streamlined refinancing is intended for homeowners who purchased their homes using a USDA-issued home loan and provides an option for borrowers to refinance for more affordable loan terms.





Key Takeaways

The USDA streamlined refinancing option provides current USDA loan borrowers with low or no equity the opportunity to refinance for more affordable payment terms. USDA loans are designed to provide homebuyers with lenient eligibility requirements that help low- to moderate-income families purchase a home in mostly rural areas.The streamlined process offers many borrowers refinancing with no new appraisal or home inspection.


   Understanding USDA Streamlined Refinancing  

The USDA loan is a mortgage option available to some rural and suburban homebuyers. The USDA offers home loans directly and guarantees loans issued by qualified lenders. Qualification standards for these home loans are lenient compared to those of other mortgages. USDA loans are designed to help low- to moderate-income borrowers purchase homes in mostly rural areas. A Section 502 loan, which is a loan available to low-income individuals and households in rural areas, is one example of this type of loan.



The USDA has two programs to refinance direct and guaranteed loans—streamlined-assist and standard streamlined.



USDA refinancing is similar to other federal streamlined refinancing options, such as the Federal Housing Administration's (FHA) streamline refinancing, Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) streamline refinancing, and Home Affordable Refinancing Program (HARP) from government-sponsored enterprises Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.






A streamlined refinanced loan even allows you to wrap your closing costs and escrow charges into the new loan amount. That helps homeowners receive a zero out-of-pocket refinance for which no cash is needed upfront.


   Eligibility Requirements for USDA Streamlined Refinancing  

The eligibility requirements for the most popular USDA refinancing program, known as streamlined-assist, are straightforward. To be eligible, the home to be refinanced must be the borrower's primary residence, the home must have its mortgage from a USDA direct home loan or a USDA guaranteed home loan, the borrower must have made 12 consecutive on-time payments before the refinancing application, and the refinancing must result in the borrower's payment decreasing by at least $50 per month.



Unlike a typical loan application, there are no credit report, home appraisal, or property inspection requirements. Current income is not a qualifying factor either. The borrower must only document that their income falls within current USDA limits.



Another refinancing program includes the USDA standard streamline program. Similar to the streamlined-assist program, no appraisal is required, and homeowners that are underwater on their mortgage are eligible, which follows generally the same rules as the streamlined-assist loan.



However, homeowners have to provide proof of current income and meet certain debt-to-income requirements. Benefits of this particular option include no requirement to drop the payment by at least $50, and existing borrowers listed on the note can be removed as long as one of the original borrowers remains on the loan. The latter can be beneficial in the case of divorce.


   USDA Streamlined Refinancing Rates  

To refinance a guaranteed loan, check out the USDA's list of approved lenders. They offer USDA loans, but the USDA does not recommend specific lenders. You'll need to shop around to make sure you're getting the best terms and a lower interest rate.



The interest rate for direct loans as of Oct. 1, 2021, is 2.5%, but your effective rate can be as low as 1% after subsidies.




What Loan Refinancing Options Does the USDA Offer?
The USDA offers direct loans and guarantees loans issued by private lenders to low- and moderate-income borrowers in rural areas. It oversees two programs to refinance these loans—streamlined-assist and standard streamlined.




What Are the Requirements to Refinance a USDA Loan?
Under either program, the home to be refinanced must be a primary residence and have a mortgage from a USDA direct or guaranteed home loan, among other requirements. Neither requires a home appraisal or inspection. However, qualifying for a standard refinance is harder. For example, in contrast to streamlined-assist refinancing, standard streamlined refinancing takes into account debt-to-income (DTI) ratios.




What Are the Benefits of USDA Streamlined Refinancing?
Streamlined refinancing offers a hassle-free way to refinance a USDA mortgage. The main benefit is lower loan payments.
What Is Use and Occupancy (U&O)?  

The term use and occupancy (U&O) refers to a real estate agreement between two parties that allows one party to use and/or occupy a property before ownership is transferred from one side to the other. A U&O provides some security if and when complications arise due to financing problems or when there are delays in the closing process. Some governments require U&Os whenever properties are sold to secure the rights of all parties involved.






Use & Occupancy permits require a fee to be paid upon transfer of real property, which is used to pay for a home inspection. 


   How Use and Occupancy (U&O) Works  

Real estate transactions usually go smoothly—for the most part. But in some cases, the parties involved may experience various problems. For instance, the buyer in a transaction may have problems securing or finalizing mortgage financing, or there may be a delay in the closing if there is a problem for the seller clearing title to the property. So when one party requires the use of the property before the transfer of ownership is complete, they may do so by drawing up a use and occupancy agreement.



As noted above, there are certain jurisdictions that require a formal agreement before a buyer or seller is able to occupy a property. These are legally binding contracts that set limits on the length of time that the party can stay on the property before any action can be taken. For instance, an agreement may allow a seller to remain in the home for a month until the closing process is complete before ownership is transferred to the buyer.



U&O regulations usually require the seller of a property to pay a fee of around $100 and allow a government official to inspect the property. The inspection ensures that the property complies with local housing codes and ordinances and that all the necessary permits have been filed. The inspection—also referred to as a resale inspection—must be completed within a limited timeframe. A U&O certificate or occupancy permit is then issued and may only be valid for a limited time such as 90 days.



In areas that don't have a U&O requirement, buyers and sellers can make their own determinations about the condition in which they are willing to buy and sell real estate, allowing the transaction to proceed quickly and smoothly. 





Key Takeaways

Use and occupancy is a real estate agreement that allows one party to use and/or occupy a property before ownership is transferred from the other party.U&O permits ensure that everything is up to local code, ordinance, and all related permits have been filed.U&O inspections must be completed within a certain timeframe and are only valid for a specified amount of time.Buyers and sellers specify the terms of the agreement in areas In areas with no U&O requirements.


   Special Considerations  

The buyer may purchase a private home inspection and may ask the seller to make repairs as a condition of closing the deal. The seller is free to agree to make the repairs, to negotiate for the buyer to perform a portion of the repairs, or to walk away from the transaction. When the local government is involved, the seller is forced to spend time and money to fix anything the government deems necessary without regard to the prospective buyer's requirements.






Sellers must complete any repairs outlined by their local government in jurisdictions that require U&O agreements, whereas sellers where with properties in areas that have no U&O requirements may refuse to pay for any upgrades.


   Advantages and Disadvantages of Use and Occupancy Agreements   

U&O agreements between buyers and sellers of property can be used to cover unexpected changes to the move-in date and use of real estate. A U&O agreement could have terms that grant the buyer of a property early access to move furniture and belongings to the premises. The buyer would still have to wait until the official occupancy date before they could take full possession of the property. This may be necessary if the buyer has already closed on the sale of their prior property and must move.



The seller of a property might also run into issues closing the transaction and moving on to their new property. They could be left between the two properties without a place they could full occupy as an owner. A use and occupancy agreement could allow the new owner who purchased the property the right to give permission to the seller to remain on the premises for some additional time while the issues are resolved.



The terms of a U&O agreement will likely set strict time limits on how long the buyer or seller might use or temporarily take up occupancy on the property. The agreement could also set guidelines that would allow the current owner to remove a temporary occupant if necessary.
What Is a Use Tax?  

The term use tax refers to a conditional sales tax. The use tax is charged on any goods purchased without paying a sales tax when one would normally be applied in their home state. One of the most common instances of the use tax is when someone buys goods from another state where no sales tax is levied and the consumer intends to use, store, or distribute the goods where a sales tax would normally apply. The rate is generally the same as the local sales tax rate. It's up to consumers to calculate and pay use taxes, which makes it difficult to enforce.





Key Takeaways

The use tax is imposed on goods that are used, distributed, or store in an area where sales tax is normally imposed but are purchased where no sales tax is collected.The use tax is generally the same rate as the local/state sales tax. Consumers are responsible for calculating and remitting the use tax to the government.The purpose of the use tax is to protect in-state retailers against competition from out-of-state sellers that don't have to collect sales taxes.The use tax is difficult to enforce because the onus lies on consumers to report and pay it.


   Understanding Use Taxes  

The use tax is a type of sales tax charged on certain goods. Unlike a sales tax, the use tax is only applied in certain circumstances rather than on all goods and services. The use tax is charged by a consumer's home municipality or state in any number of cases. Some of the most common ones include:



Whenever a consumer purchases items outside their home jurisdiction and the seller doesn't charge a sales tax. The use tax is charged if the customer intends to use or store the goods in an area where a sales tax is imposed.When goods are purchased out-of-state and the seller doesn't charge a sales tax.Professionals who purchase goods for their trade in a jurisdiction where there is no sales tax but will be used in an area where there is one.



The use tax rate is the same as the resident's local sales tax rate, which includes both state and local sales taxes. It is up to consumers to calculate and pay use taxes on any applicable purchases they make. A resident who does not pay use tax may be subject to interest and penalties.



For example, California residents must pay sales tax on things like furniture, gifts, toys, clothing, vehicles, mobile homes, and aircraft. If a Californian purchases clothing from a California retailer, the retailer will collect sales tax from the buyer at the point of sale and remit it to the tax authorities. No additional tax will be due. They would pay tax if they bring any of these goods back to California if they were purchased in Arizona, where no sales tax is charged.


   Use Tax vs. Sales Tax  

A use tax is ultimately the same as a sales tax. A sales tax is imposed by the government on the sale of goods and services. It is added to the purchase price at the point of sale, which means the seller collects it and remits it directly to the government.



Sales tax rates vary by jurisdiction. Some states charge a higher sales tax than others, while some don't charge any at all. Certain states don't impose a sales tax on certain items, such as food, clothing, and books. Others have a blanket tax on everything.



The use tax is usually the same rate as the local/state sales tax. The difference lies in how it's accounted for and who calculates it. The use tax is self-assessed and remitted by the end consumer, so if you make a purchase and are liable for your state's use tax, it's up to you to figure out how much you owe and pay it.



The use tax is generally more difficult to enforce than the sales tax and, in practice, is only applied to large purchases of tangible goods.

The number of states that impose a use tax. It is the same as the number of states with a sales tax.


   Use Tax and Nexus  

A nexus is generally defined as a physical presence, such as a sales office or warehouse. But this presence is not limited to these examples. In fact, you can have a nexus just by having an employee or an affiliate in a state or even a partner website that directs traffic to your webpage in exchange for a share of profits. So how does this relate to a use tax?



Retailers are usually not required to collect sales tax on purchases made by consumers in states where the retailer does not have a physical presence. As such, the onus falls on the consumer to calculate and remit the tax to his or her state government. Whether a business owes sales taxes to a particular government depends on the way that government defines nexus.



Tensions arising from the e-commerce industry's failure to pay sales taxes prompted some states to enact laws to ensure businesses pay their fair share. For example, New York passed Amazon laws requiring internet retailers such as Amazon to pay sales taxes despite their lack of physical presence in the state.


   Purpose of Use Tax  

The purpose of the use tax is supposed to protect in-state retailers against unfair competition from out-of-state sellers that aren't required to collect tax. It also ensures that all of a state's residents help fund state and local programs and services, regardless of where they shop. Similar laws apply in most states, not just California.



As noted above, it is often difficult to enforce. That's because it's up to consumers to report and pay the use tax. This means governments end up losing a chunk of revenue to goods purchased in areas where no sales tax is collected, which is why some states require online vendors to collect taxes whenever their customers make purchases.


   Example of Use Tax  

Let's say that a Californian bought clothing from an online retailer in Oregon. Under Oregon law, the retailer does not collect sales tax on the goods but the retail buyer must still pay a use tax on that clothing purchase to the California tax authority called the Board of Equalization.



On the other hand, if the Californian purchased groceries in Oregon and did not pay any sales tax on the purchase, generally no use tax would be due because the state of California does not tax the majority of groceries.




What Does the Use Tax Mean?
The use tax is a type of sales tax. It is imposed on goods purchased and brought back home from outside a consumer's jurisdiction when no sales tax is charged there. The rate is generally the same




What's the Difference Between the Use Tax and the Sales Tax?
A sales and use tax are ultimately the same thing. They are both applied to goods and services. The difference lies in how they're calculated and who pays them. While a sales tax is applied at the time a purchase is made and is collected and remitted to the government by the seller, a use tax is calculated and paid by the consumer or end user. The rate, however, is generally the same as the local/state sales tax.




How Much Is the Use Tax in California?
The use tax rate in California is  7.25%, which is the same as the sales tax applied across the state.


   The Bottom Line  

Taxation comes in many forms. But many people aren't aware of the use tax, which almost all states impose on consumers. The use tax is a form of sales tax that you must pay for goods and services you intend to use in a state where you'd normally pay sales tax and purchase anywhere else where they aren't required to collect sales tax. The government does this to ensure that local sellers aren't at a disadvantage. But it can be hard to enforce because many consumers don't report or pay their use taxes. Failure to pay use taxes can result in fines or penalties. You can consult your state's tax department to find out more about how to pay any use taxes you may owe.
What Is Useful Life?  

The useful life of an asset is an accounting estimate of the number of years it is likely to remain in service for the purpose of cost-effective revenue generation. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) employs useful life estimates to determine the amount of time during which an asset can be depreciated. There are a variety of factors that can affect useful life estimates, including usage patterns, the age of the asset at the time of purchase and technological advances.


   Understanding Useful Life  

Useful life refers to the estimated duration of utility placed on a variety of business assets, including buildings, machinery, equipment, vehicles, electronics, and furniture. Useful life estimations terminate at the point when assets are expected to become obsolete, require major repairs, or cease to deliver economical results. The estimation of the useful life of each asset, which is measured in years, can serve as a reference for depreciation schedules used to write off expenses related to the purchase of capital goods.


   Useful Life and Straight Line Depreciation  

The depreciation of assets using the straight-line model divides the cost of an asset by the number of years in its estimated life calculation to determine a yearly depreciation value. The value is depreciated in equal amounts over the course of the estimated useful life. For example, the depreciation of an asset purchased for $1 million with an estimated useful life of 10 years is $100,000 per year.


   Useful Life and Accelerated Depreciation  

Businesses may also elect to take higher depreciation levels at the beginning of the useful life period, with declining depreciation values over the duration of the time span using an accelerated model. The yearly write-offs in the reducing balance depreciation model decline by a set percentage rate to zero. Using the sum of the years method, depreciation declines by a set dollar amount each year throughout the useful life period.


   Useful Life Adjustments  

The duration of utility in a useful life estimate can be changed under a variety of conditions, including the early obsolescence of an asset due to technological advances in similar applications. To change a useful life estimate in this circumstance, the company must provide a clear explanation to the IRS, backed by documentation comparing the old and new technologies. For example, if a company's original useful life estimate is 10 years, but new technology is likely to render it obsolete after eight years, the company may be able to accelerate depreciation based on a shorter schedule. In this situation, a company that is depreciating assets based on a 10-year schedule may be able to increase yearly depreciation values based on a newly abbreviated eight-year useful life estimate.
What Is a User Fee?  

A user fee is a sum of money paid as a necessary condition to gain access to a particular service or facility. Examples of user fees could include highway tolls or parking garages.



People pay user fees for the use of many government-affiliated services and facilities as well. At the federal level, for example, there is a fee to go up to the top of the Statue of Liberty and to drive into the country’s many national parks. Also, certain services offered by the Library of Congress in Washington, D.C. require the public to pay a fee.


   How User Fees Work  

In levying or authorizing user fees from a government standpoint, the U.S. Congress determines whether the revenue should go into the Treasury or should be available to the agency providing the goods or services. Government services and facilities that are supported by user fees instead of by taxes may closely resemble private businesses because it is not apparent whether a true demand exists for those services and facilities.



In that sense, the line between user fees and taxes can blur in certain circumstances. Sometimes, a tax will be incorrectly labeled as a user fee for political reasons (i.e., user fees that are often deemed more palatable and able to be passed on to voters, than taxes). For example, if a politician wants to keep a promise to not raise taxes but still take certain steps to try to increase government revenue streams, the politician may push for an increase in certain kinds of taxes that can be labeled as fees.



In contrast to user fees, taxes must be paid and do not necessarily go toward a specific service or facility that an individual actually uses or benefits from. For example, the money governments spend to treat smoking-related illnesses, in this case via the sale of cigarettes, could be considered both a tax and a fee. Income taxes can be an alternative to funding facilities and services with user fees. Everyone pays income taxes, including those who may not necessarily use or benefit from a specific facility or service.





Key Takeaways

User fees describe the cost necessary to gain access to a product, service, or facility.Governments may utilize user fees in lieu of, or in addition to, levying taxes to generate revenue.The money collected from user fees is generally intended to be reinvested back into the upkeep and expansion of that service, product, or facility.


   User Fees and Economic Development  

Within international development circles, user fees refer to a system fee for fundamental health care, education and other essential services implemented by a developing country to make up for the costs of these services. For one, the International Monetary Fund often recommends that nations start charging fees for these services in order to reduce budget deficits.



For poorer nations, however, such user fees can have a counteractive effect, adding a burdensome expense on an already impoverished population.
What are 'Usual, Customary and Reasonable (UCR) Fees'?  

Usual, customary and reasonable (UCR) fees are out-of-pocket fees that a health insurance policyholder must pay for services. UCR fees are based on the services provided to policyholders, as well as the area of the country where the services are being provided.


   Understanding Usual, Customary and Reasonable Fees  

A fee is considered usual, customary and reasonable if:



It is a fee usually charged for a doctor for a service, andIt falls within a price range that other doctors in the area charge, andIt is for a service deemed necessary under the current conditions.



UCR fees are monitored by the insurance company, which determines whether they make sense when compared to what doctors in the area are charging. If a doctor charges more than what the insurance company determines to be usual, customary and reasonable, the policyholder may be responsible for the difference between the amount charged for the service and the amount covered by the insurance company.



The amount of usual, customary and reasonable fees that are charged for services depends on a variety of factors, and the conditions under which a UCR fee is charged are outlined in the policy. Many medical insurance policies, for example, break providers into “network” and “out of network” groupings. Using an in-network provider may result in no UCR fees being charged, but using an out-of-network doctor may result in the policyholder is responsible for some or even all of the service costs.



Many policyholders only think about the cost of medical services after the service is provided, and can be caught off guard when their insurance doesn’t cover all expenses. In order to mitigate the possibility of a big bill, policyholders should check whether a doctor is in the insurer’s network, talk to the doctor about the cost of any service before the service is provided, and ask the insurer how much of the fee will be covered.


   Usual, Customary and Reasonable Fees and Medicare  

Medicare UCR charges are not regulated by state or federal agencies, but Medicare does publish its UCR fee schedule. This is commonly referred to as "Medicare Allowable" charges. Providers who participate with Medicare agree to accept the Medicare allowable charge as full payment. Patients are still responsible for their co-insurance and deductible.



 Medicare providers may choose not to bill the patient for amounts above the Medicare allowable fee schedule. It is important to verify that a provider "Accepts Medicare Assignment" or is a "Medicare Provider" to avoid unexpected and potentially large out-of-pocket expenses.
What Is a Usufruct?  

A usufruct is a legal right accorded to a person or party that confers the temporary right to use and derive income or benefit from someone else's property. It is a limited real right that can be found in many mixed and civil law jurisdictions. A usufructuary is the person holding the property by usufruct.



A usufruct combines the two property rights of usus and fructus. Usus refers to the right to use something directly without damaging or altering it, and fructus refers to the right to enjoy the fruits of the property being used—that is, to profit from the real property by leasing it, selling crops produced by it, charging admission to it, or similar.



Usufruct is usually conferred for a limited time period. It can be granted to the usufructuary, or person holding usufruct, as a way to look after property until the death of a property owner and the estate can be settled if the property owner is in ill health. While the usufructuary has the right to use the property, they cannot damage or destroy it or dispose of the property. A usufructuary does not have full ownership of the property, because they do not enjoy the third property right, abusus, which refers to the right to consume, destroy, or transfer ownership of the property to someone else.


   How a Usufruct Works  

In usufruct, a person or group has the right to use the property of another. They do not own it but have a contractually sanctioned interest in it. There are two types of usufruct: perfect and imperfect. In perfect usufruct, the usufructuary can use the property, and can profit from it, but cannot change it in a substantial way. For example, if the owner of a business becomes incapacitated and gives usufruct to a relative to run the business for him or her, the usufructuary can run the business, but can’t sell it or tear down the building and rebuild it. In an imperfect usufruct system, the usufructuary does have some power to alter the property, such as when a landowner grants usufruct to a piece of land for agricultural use. The usufructuary may have the right to produce crops from the land and to make improvements to the land that would aid in that endeavor. However, the usufructuary does not own these improvements; when the usufruct ends, they belong to the original owner or to his or her estate.



Usufruct is only recognized in a few jurisdictions in North America, such as Louisiana. As an example, if a party has a usufruct in a real estate property, they have the full right to use it or rent it out and collect the rental income without sharing it with the actual owner, as long as the usufruct is in effect.


   Usufruct Example  

For example, Bert has been granted usufruct over Helen's property. Helen's property is a bed-and-breakfast with a large yard that needs tending. Helen is in ill health and can no longer tend to the property and run the business. Bert, as the usufructuary, has the right to use the property and run the business on Helen's behalf for the time the usufruct is in effect. The usufruct may be in effect until Helen's death when the estate will be settled and the property will be passed on per act of law or the directions in the estate.
What Is Usury?  

Usury is the act of lending money at an interest rate that is considered unreasonably high or that is higher than the rate permitted by law. Usury first became common in England under King Henry VIII and originally pertained to charging any amount of interest on loaned funds. Over time it evolved to mean charging excess interest, but in some religions and parts of the world charging any interest is considered illegal.





Key Takeaways

Usury is the act of lending money at an interest rate that is considered unreasonably high or that is higher than the rate permitted by law.It first became common in England under King Henry VIII.Judaism, Christianity, and Islam especially take a very strong stance against usury.Today, usury laws help protect investors from predatory lenders.States set their own usury laws and as a result, each state has different usury interest rate caps.


   Understanding Usury  

Charging interest on loans is not a new concept, but in 16th-century England, limitations were put on the amount of interest that one could legally charge on a loan. However, throughout history, certain religions have abstained from usury altogether as charging interest went against their core principles.



Given that early lending was done between individuals and small groups, in contrast with the modern banking system used today, setting firm social standards for lending terms was deemed essential.






High interest rates on credit cards are one of the driving reasons behind the high consumer debt levels in the U.S.



Specifically, Judaism, Christianity, and Islam (the three Abrahamic faiths) take a very strong stance against usury. Several passages in the Old Testament condemn the practice of usury, especially when lending to less wealthy individuals without access to more secure means of financing. In the Jewish community, this created the rule of lending money at interest only to outsiders.



The Old Testament’s condemnation of usury also led to the Christian tradition against money lending. Some Christians believe that those who lend should not expect anything in return. The Protestant Reformation in the 16th century brought about a distinction between usury (charging high-interest rates) and the more acceptable lending of money at low-interest rates. Islam, on the other hand, has historically not made this distinction, but charging interest is not allowed in the religion.


   Usury Laws and Predatory Lending  

Today, usury laws help protect investors from predatory lenders.



Predatory lending is broadly defined by the FDIC as “imposing unfair and abusive loan terms on borrowers." Predatory lending often targets groups with less access to and understanding of more traditional forms of financing. Predatory lenders can charge unreasonably high-interest rates and require significant collateral in the likely event a borrower defaults.



Predatory lending is also affiliated with payday loans, also termed payday advances or small-dollar loans, among other names. Payday loans are small-sum, short-term unsecured loans, which can appear to carry substantial risk to the lender. To prevent usury, some jurisdictions limit the annual percentage rate (APR) that a payday lender can charge, while others outlaw the practice entirely.



Usury laws are determined by the state and vary from state to state. The rate that is allowed by state usury laws depends on the size of the loan, the type of individual/entity making the loan, and the type of loan. Usury laws don't apply to all loans but only to certain ones as deemed by the state.



The types of loans subject to usury laws include ones where there is no written agreement from a non-bank institute, loans with a written agreement from a non-bank institute, private student loans, payday loans, and any other types of contracts with non-bank institutes.



Credit cards have very high interest rates but credit cards do not fall under usury laws as determined by a U.S. Supreme Court ruling ( Marquette National Bank of Minneapolis vs. First of Omaha Service Corp.) in 1978.


  Penalties for Usury  

As usury laws are determined individually by states, the penalties for violating usury laws vary. The penalty may include the lender having to return all interest to the borrower, most often with additional fees added on. The fees usually amount to more than the interest the creditor would have received. Violators may also be subject to jail time.


   Example of Usury  

John is unemployed and has no health insurance. He injures himself while fixing his roof, resulting in medical bills costing him $10,000. John is able to cover $2,000 from his savings but does not have the remainder in cash to cover his medical bills. He asks family members and friends to borrow money, but none have available cash.



Hard-pressed, John borrows money from a friend of a friend he doesn't know very well. The creditor loans him the $8,000 and charges him an interest rate of 18% a month. The state in which John lives has a usury law in place that limits the interest rate to 9%. In this case, the creditor is charging john usury and is in violation of state law.




Is Usury a Crime?
Usury is most often a crime but can also be a violation. The federal government, along with each state, has its own usury laws, stating the maximum interest rate that can be charged on certain types of loans. If a creditor charges a rate higher than this, they would be breaking the law and held accountable for violation of the usury law.




What Is the Current Usury Rate?
Each state specifies its own usury rate and how it is calculated. For example, the current usury rate in North Dakota is the "maximum rate of interest which may be charged for loans of money by non-regulated lenders and is equal to 5.5% higher than the current cost of money as reflected by the average rate of interest payable on U.S. Treasury Bills maturing within six months; but in any event, the maximum allowable interest rate ceiling may not be less than 7%."




When Did Usury Become Illegal?
Usury has a long history. It has primarily become illegal to prevent individuals from predatory loan practices; situations in which people need to borrow money but are charged a high interest rate, often resulting in difficulty paying back the loan with interest and/or financial ruin. Usury is also not permitted in many religions, which has had an impact on its legality in society.




Do Usury Laws Apply to Private Loans?
Yes, usury laws do apply to private loans. Most loans made outside of a banking institution are subject to usury laws to prevent unfair lending practices.
What Are Usury Laws?  

Usury laws are regulations governing the amount of interest that can be charged on a loan. Usury laws specifically target the practice of charging excessively high rates on loans by setting caps on the maximum amount of interest that can be levied. These laws are designed to protect consumers.



In the United States, individual states are responsible for setting their own usury laws.﻿﻿ Though this type of financial activity could fall under the Constitution's commerce clause, Congress has not traditionally focused on usury. The government does consider the collection of usury through violent means a federal offense.﻿﻿





Key Takeaways

Usury laws set a limit on how much interest can be charged on a variety of loans, such as credit cards, personal loans, or payday loans.Usury laws are mostly regulated and enforced by the states, rather than on a federal level.Because usury laws are determined by the states, the laws vary depending on where you live; as a result, interest rates may be drastically higher from one state to the next.Some banks charge the maximum rate that is allowed in the state in which they are incorporated, as opposed to the state where you live—a practice that was legalized following a 1978 U.S. Supreme Court ruling.


   How Usury Laws Are Circumvented  

Credit card companies typically have the benefit of being able to charge interest rates that are allowed by the state where the company was incorporated rather than follow the usury laws that apply in the states where borrowers live. Nationally chartered banks similarly can apply the highest interest allowed by the state where the institution was incorporated. By incorporating in states such as Delaware or South Dakota, such lenders have historically benefited from greater leeway allowed by those states’ relaxed usury laws.



Delaware, in particular, is frequently chosen as the state of incorporation for many financial institutions because of the freedom allowed regarding the charging of interest rates. About half of the domestic credit business in the U.S. market is conducted by companies that incorporated in Delaware, though they may maintain their operational headquarters in other states.


   Special Considerations  

There is some debate on the effectiveness of usury laws after decisions by the U.S. Supreme Court and legislation gave financial institutions the capacity to circumvent the limits. The high court’s decisions in the case of Marquette National Bank v. First of Omaha Corp. allowed credit companies to charge customers who were out of state at the same interest rates the companies could charge in the states where they were incorporated.﻿﻿



Delaware’s introduction of the Financial Center Development Act, which largely eliminated limits in the state on fees and interest that can be charged on consumer lending, further amplified the desire among financial institutions to move there.﻿﻿ Banks simply had to establish subsidiaries or meet other terms for incorporation in the state to benefit from the law and thereby circumvent usury laws in other states. In response to this activity, some other states changed their usury laws to grant locally-based financial institutions the ability to charge interest rates on a par with out-of-state lenders.
What Is a Usury Rate?  

The term usury rate refers to a rate of interest that is considered to be excessive as compared to prevailing market interest rates. They are often associated with unsecured consumer loans, particularly those relating to subprime borrowers.





Key Takeaways

Usury rates are excessively high interest rates that are often illegal.They are associated with predatory lending practices, which are illegal in many states and countries.Within the United States, usury rates are defined at the state level, as there is no federal guidelines on maximum interest rates.Usury rates typically apply to consumer loans, though different rules often apply for different types of debt such as credit cards.In some cases, the line between usury rates and merely high interest rates to compensate for a high degree of lending risk can be difficult to discern.


   Understanding Usury Rates  

Historically, the term usury was used to describe all forms of lending involving the payment of interest by the borrower. In recent times, however, the term is generally used to describe only those loans which carry particularly high rates of interest. These high rates have therefore come to be known as usury rates.



In the United States, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) associates usury rates with predatory lending, which it describes as the practice of "imposing unfair or abusive loan terms on borrowers." Predatory lenders will generally target demographic groups with less access to or understanding of more affordable forms of financing.





Religious Responses to Usury

The practice of lending for interest has existed for thousands of years. Over the centuries, Christianity, Judaism, and Islam have all condemned predatory lending and have pursued various strategies to regulate the practice.


   Usury Laws by State  

Usury laws and high interest rates are directly related to state laws on the matter. Each state can set its own requirements. For example:



Washington: A lender may charge interest greater than 12% per year if the interest rate has been agreed to in writing.



North Dakota: The usury rate is equal to 5.5% higher than the current cost of money based on the interest rate on U.S. Treasury Bills maturing within six months. The maximum allowable interest rate ceiling may not be less than 7%.



Missouri: The usury rate is the greater of the market rate or 10%, with the interest rate on second mortgages deregulated.



Each state can have its own process for setting the rate. Examples of the baselines states can use to set usury rates include:



Setting rates based on short-term (6-month) U.S. Treasury Bill ratesSetting rates based on long-term (52-week) U.S. Treasury Bill ratesSetting rates based on the U.S. prime rateSetting fixed ratesSetting rates based on written agreed rates






There is no federal regulation dictating usury interest rates.


   Usury Rate Applications  

Most usury interest rates apply to consumer loans, and usury laws dictate what financial institutions can and cannot charge clients. Because usury laws are primarily dictated by states, usury rates often do not apply to credit card debt, retail installment contracts, or consumer leases.



One of the more obvious disconnects regarding usury rates are credit cards. Consider the options offered by Bank of America as of July 2022. After the introductory APR offer ends, clients will be charged interest at a variable APR rate will fluctuate between 15.49% and 25.49%.



Usury interest rates do not apply to credit card companies as courts have held that national banking associations can charge cardholders according to the law of the state in which it is chartered, not necessarily where the customer resides.



In addition, not every state has usury laws that restrict business contracts performed within the state.


   Assessing Usury Rates  

The line between a usurious interest rate and a merely high interest rate can be difficult to assess with quantified boundaries set by state. For instance, payday lenders—who provide high-interest loans to subprime borrowers—are often accused of being predatory lenders.



Their defenders, however, argue that their high-interest rates are justified by the fact that the loans they provide carry unusually high risk. Without permitting high-interest rates as compensation for this risk, those who rely on payday loans may find themselves without any financing options at all.



Several organizations such as TreasuryDirect and The Wall Street Journal provide real-time or periodic updates on interest rates in markets such as personal lines of credit (LOCs), auto loans, student loans, home mortgages, and many others. By reviewing these sources, consumers can better understand whether the rates offered by a particular lender are reasonable.



Using these means, consumers seeking credit often have resources available to determine whether rates are excessively high. Similar to any free market where consumers can choose to buy any good at any price, loans can be priced differently. It may sometimes be up to the customer seeking a loan to determine what price they are willing to pay.






Usury rates seem to have existed during Ancient Egypt. There is evidence that the Code of Hammurabi contains legal verbiage that regulates interest rates.


   Example of Usury Rate  

James is a first-time homebuyer looking for mortgage financing. Although James currently has a well-paying job, he had faced issues with personal debt in the past and as such has a very low credit rating. Due to his poor credit history, the mainstream banks are unwilling to extend him a mortgage. Therefore, James is forced to look for alternative means of financing his home purchase.



One of the options available to him is a private lender named Diane, who offers to lend him 80% of the purchase price of the home over a 25-year amortization period, with an interest rate of 40% per year. Diane argues that although the 40% interest rate is considerably higher than that offered by the banks, it is not unreasonable due to the fact that James's credit score indicates he is a high-risk borrower.



After doing more research into the prevalent interest rates in various markets, James rejects Diane's proposal. He argues that although he is considered a subprime borrower, the 40% interest rate is unreasonably high and an example of predatory lending.




What Is a Usury Interest Rate?
A usury interest rate is an interest rate deemed to be illegally high. To discourage predatory lending and promote economic activity, states may enact laws that set a ceiling on the interest rate that can be charged for certain types of debt. Interest rates above this ceiling are considered usury and are illegal.




What's The Maximum Interest Rate Allowed By Law?
The maximum interest rate will vary from state to state based on each geographical location's legislation. Some states do not have interest rate limits for some types of loans. In addition, some states currently have very lax restrictions. For example, New Mexico has presented a House bill to reduce the APR on loans up to $5,000 from 175% APR to 36% APR on loans up to $10,000.




Why Are Usury Interest Rates Illegal?
Usury rates are considered predatory loans where the lender is in a position to take advantage of the borrower. Usury law attempts to protect the consumer by allowing a lender to still obtain a profit on a loan and compensation for incurring risk. However, usury rates are in place to often encourage business transactions and minimize price gouging on loans.
What Is Utilitarianism?  

Utilitarianism is a theory of morality that advocates actions that foster happiness or pleasure and oppose actions that cause unhappiness or harm. When directed toward making social, economic, or political decisions, a utilitarian philosophy would aim for the betterment of society as a whole.



Utilitarianism would say that an action is right if it results in the happiness of the greatest number of people in a society or a group.





Key Takeaways

Utilitarianism is a theory of morality that advocates actions that foster happiness and oppose actions that cause unhappiness.Utilitarianism promotes "the greatest amount of good for the greatest number of people."When used in a sociopolitical construct, utilitarian ethics aims for the betterment of society as a whole.Utilitarianism is a reason-based approach to determining right and wrong, but it has limitations.Utilitarianism does not account for things like feelings and emotions, culture, or justice.


   Understanding Utilitarianism  

Utilitarianism is a tradition of ethical philosophy that is associated with Jeremy Bentham (1747-1832) and John Stuart Mill (1806-1873), two late 18th- and 19th-century British philosophers, economists, and political thinkers. Utilitarianism holds that an action is right if it tends to promote happiness and wrong if it tends to produce sadness, or the reverse of happiness—not just the happiness of the actor but that of everyone affected by it.



At work, you display utilitarianism when you take actions to ensure that the office is a positive environment for your co-workers to be in, and then make it so for yourself.






"The greatest good for the greatest number" is a maxim of utilitarianism.


  The 3 Generally Accepted Principles of Utilitarianism State That  

Pleasure, or happiness, is the only thing that has intrinsic value. To say that something has intrinsic value means that it is simply good in itself. Intrinsic value contrasts with instrumental value. Something has instrumental value when it is a means to some end.
Actions are right if they promote happiness, and wrong if they promote unhappiness. This principle is quite controversial since it involves that the moral quality of an action is decided by the size of its consequences. So long as an action produces maximum benefits for the greatest number of people, utilitarianism does not care whether the results are driven by immoral motives. However, this principle can be refuted since most people would agree that the moral quality of an action depends on the motive or intention behind it.
Everyone's happiness counts equally. Although this axiom may seem quite obvious, this principle of equality was radical and progressive in Bentham's time. By then, it was commonly accepted that some lives and some people's happiness were simply more important and valuable than others. Betham's principle of equality makes the government responsible for creating policies that would benefit all equally, not just the elite.


   From the Founders of Utilitarianism  

Jeremy Bentham describes his "greatest happiness principle" in Introduction to the Principles of Morals and Legislation, a 1789 publication in which he writes: "Nature has placed mankind under the governance of two sovereign masters, pain and pleasure. It is for them alone to point out what we ought to do, as well as to determine what we shall do."



John Stuart Mill had many years to absorb and reflect on Jeremy Bentham's thoughts on utilitarianism by the time he published his own work, Utilitarianism, in 1863. The key passage from this book:



The creed which accepts as the foundation of morals utility, or the greatest happiness principle, holds that actions are right in proportion as they tend to promote happiness, wrong as they tend to produce the reverse of happiness. By happiness is intended pleasure, and the absence of pain; by unhappiness, pain, and the privation of pleasure.


   Utilitarianism's Relevance in a Political Economy  

In liberal democracies throughout the centuries, the progenitors of utilitarianism spawned variants and extensions of its core principles. Some of the questions they wrestled with include: What constitutes "the greatest amount of good"? How is happiness defined? How is justice accommodated?



In today's Western democracies, policymakers are generally proponents of free markets and some base level of government interference in the private lives of citizens so as to assure safety and security. Although the appropriate amount of regulation and laws will always be a subject of debate, political and economic policies are geared primarily toward fostering as much well-being for as many people as possible, or at least they should be. Where there are disadvantaged groups who suffer income inequality or other negative consequences because of a utilitarian-based policy or action, most politicians would try to find a remedy.


   In Business and Commerce  

Utilitarianism holds that the most ethical choice is the one that will produce the greatest good for the greatest number. As such, it is the only moral framework that can justify military force or war. Moreover, utilitarianism is the most common approach to business ethics because of the way that it accounts for costs and benefits.



The theory asserts that there are two types of utilitarian ethics practiced in the business world, "rule" utilitarianism and "act" utilitarianism.



Rule utilitarianism helps the largest number of people using the fairest methods possible.Act utilitarianism makes the most ethical actions possible for the benefit of the people.


   In the Corporate Workplace  

Most companies have a formal or informal code of ethics, which is shaped by their corporate culture, values, and regional laws. Today, having a formalized code of business ethics is more important than ever. For a business to grow, it not only needs to increase its bottom line, but it also must create a reputation for being socially responsible. Companies also must endeavor to keep their promises and put ethics at least on par with profits. Consumers are looking for companies that they can trust, and employees work better when there is a solid model of ethics in place.



On an individual level, if you make morally correct decisions at work, then everyone's happiness will increase. However, if you choose to do something morally wrong—even if legal—then your happiness and that of your colleagues, will decrease.


   Utilitarian Ethics  
  "Rule" Utilitarian Ethics  

An example of rule utilitarianism in business is tiered pricing for a product or service for different types of customers. In the airline industry, for example, many planes offer first-, business-, and economy-class seats. Customers who fly in first or business class pay a much higher rate than those in economy seats, but they also get more amenities—simultaneously, people who cannot afford upper-class seats benefit from the economy rates. This practice produces the highest good for the greatest number of people.



And the airline benefits, too. The more expensive upper-class seats help to ease the financial burden that the airline created by making room for economy-class seats.


  "Act" Utilitarian Ethics  

An example of act utilitarianism could be when pharmaceutical companies release drugs that have been governmentally approved, but with known minor side effects because the drug is able to help more people than are bothered by the side effects. Act utilitarianism often demonstrates the concept that “the end justifies the means”—or it's worth it.


   Quantitative Utilitarism vs. Qualitative Utilitarism  

Quantitative utilitarianism is a branch of utilitarianism that was developed out of the work of Jeremy Bentham. Quantitative utilitarians focus on utility maximization, that is, maximizing the overall happiness of everyone, and use a hedonic approach to determine the rightness or wrongness of actions. Bentham defined as the foundation of his philosophy the principle that “it is the greatest happiness of the greatest number that is the measure of right and wrong”.



Qualitative utilitarianism is a branch of utilitarianism that arose from the work of John Stuart Mill. Qualitative utilitarians categorize pleasures and pains in a more qualitative manner, depending on the level of their consequences, and disregarding any quantifiable proof of their importance.





Quantitative vs. Qualitative

Qualitative utilitarianism argues that mental pleasures and pains are different in kind and superior in quality to purely physical ones. Quantitative utilitarianism argues that mental pleasures and pains differ from physical ones only in terms of quantity.


   The Limitations of Utilitarianism  

In the workplace, though, utilitarian ethics are difficult to achieve. These ethics also can be challenging to maintain in our business culture, where a capitalistic economy often teaches people to focus on themselves at the expense of others. Similarly, monopolistic competition teaches one business to flourish at the expense of others.



A limitation of utilitarianism is that it tends to create a black-and-white construct of morality. In utilitarian ethics, there are no shades of gray—either something is wrong or it is right.Utilitarianism also cannot predict with certainty whether the consequences of our actions will be good or bad—the results of our actions happen in the future.Utilitarianism also has trouble accounting for values like justice and individual rights. For example, say a hospital has four people whose lives depend upon receiving organ transplants: a heart, lungs, a kidney, and a liver. If a healthy person wanders into the hospital, his organs could be harvested to save four lives at the expense of his one life. This would arguably produce the greatest good for the greatest number. But few would consider it an acceptable course of action, let alone an ethical one.



So, although utilitarianism is surely a reason-based approach to determining right and wrong, it has obvious limitations.




What Are the Principles of Utilitarianism?
Utilitarianism puts forward that it is a virtue to improve one's life better by increasing the good things in the world and minimizing the bad things. This means striving for pleasure and happiness while avoiding discomfort or unhappiness.




What Is a Utilitarian?
A utilitarian is a person who holds the beliefs of utilitarianism. Today, these people might be described as cold and calculating, practical, and perhaps selfish—since they may seek their own pleasure at the expense of the social good at times.




What Is Rule Utilitarianism?
Rule utilitarians focus on the effects of actions that stem from certain rules or moral guidelines (e.g. the "golden rule", the 10 commandments, or laws against murder). If an action conforms to a moral rule then the act is moral. A rule is deemed moral if its existence increases the greater good than any other rule, or the absence of such a rule.




What Is Utilitarian Value in Consumer Behavior?
If a consumer buys something only for its practical use-value, in a calculative and rational evaluation, then it is of utilitarian value. This precludes any sort of emotional or sentimental valuing, psychological biases, or other considerations.




What Is the Role of Utilitarianism in Today’s Business Environment?
Because its ideology argues for the greatest good for the greatest number, a business acting in a utilitarian fashion should increase the welfare of others. However, in practice, utilitarianism can lead to greed and dog-eat-dog competition that can undermine the social good.


   The Bottom Line  

Utilitarianism offers a relatively simple method for deciding the morally right course of action for any particular situation. Over the years, the principle of utilitarianism has been refined and expanded in many variations. Utilitarians today describe benefits and harms in terms of the satisfaction of personal preferences or in purely economic terms of monetary benefits over monetary costs, rather than in terms of "happiness" and "pleasure".
What Is the Utilities Sector?  

Sector investing offers targeted opportunities into the stocks of companies in specific segments of the economy. The utilities sector includes companies such as electric, gas, or water utilities, or those that operate as producers or distributors of power.



As of July 2022, the sector had a market capitalization of over $1.58 trillion. Although utilities are private, for-profit companies, they are part of the public service infrastructure and are heavily regulated. Those who include utilities in their portfolios hold them as long-term investments and commonly use them to generate income through dividends.





Key Takeaways

The utilities sector includes the stock of companies such as electric, gas, and water utilities.Investors commonly buy utilities as long-term holdings.The sector is often used as an investment during economic downturns.Challenges for the sector include regulatory oversight and costly infrastructure updating and maintenance.Clean energy initiatives have some analysts forecasting strong growth for the utility industry in the 2020s.






   Understanding the Utilities Sector  

Utilities include large companies that offer multiple services such as electricity and natural gas or specialize in just one type of service, such as water. Some utilities rely on clean and renewable energy sources like wind turbines and solar panels to produce electricity.



Utilities typically offer investors stable and consistent dividends, coupled with less price volatility relative to the overall equity markets. As a result, utilities tend to perform well during recessions and economic downturns. Conversely, utility stocks tend to fall out of favor with the market during times of economic growth.



Utilities require a significant amount of expensive infrastructure and consequently carry large amounts of debt on their balance sheets. These debt loads make utilities hypersensitive to changes in the market interest rate. And because utilities are capital-intensive, they require a continuous inflow of funds to finance infrastructure upgrades and new asset purchases.



As of July 2022, higher inflation raised new challenges for utilities. During the inflation of the 1970s and 80s, utilities faced large debt, soaring fuel costs, blackouts, increased regulation, and bankruptcies. Utilities that succeed through economic challenges will likely continue to rank among the best investments for safety, generous income, and steady wealth building.






Although the sector appeals to a wide range of investors, utilities companies commonly attract income-producing investments.


   How Investors Trade Utilities  

Because utility stocks pay reliable dividends, investors often favor them over lower-dividend paying equities. After the financial crisis, the Federal Reserve cut interest rates, to stimulate the economy. As a result, investors flocked to utilities, as safer investments as utility companies are a viable defensive choice for investors during macroeconomic downturns.



If interest rates rise, investors can find higher-yielding alternatives than utilities. When a utility pays a dividend yield of 3% but increases in interest rates increase Treasury bond yields to 4%, the utility company would have to increase its dividend payout to match the rising yields.



Aside from investing in the individual stocks of utility companies, investors may also purchase regional utilities or invest in exchange-traded funds (ETFs) or sector funds containing a basket of utility stocks of companies located throughout the U.S.



The Fidelity Select Utilities Portfolio (FSUTX) includes the holdings of 29 utility companies as of March 2022 and an annual dividend yield of 1.52%. The Utilities Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLU) is one of the largest utility sector funds, with $15.5 billion in net assets, and is one of the most actively traded utility ETFs, with more than 18 million shares traded daily. The fund typically pays a dividend yield of around 3%.



The XLU's dividend yield beats the yield for the S&P 500 equity ETF, SPDR S&P 500 Trust ETF (SPY), which as of July 2022, pays around 1.56%.


   Pros and Cons of the Utilities Sector  

Utilities are stable investments that commonly provide a regular dividend to shareholders, making them a popular long-term buy-and-hold option. Dividend yields on utility stocks trend higher than those paid by other equities.



During times of economic downturns with low interest rates, utilities become attractive. They exhibit lower volatility and provide a desirable source of predictable investment returns from the dividends they pay on their shares.



Utilities, however, face intense regulatory oversight and require expensive infrastructure that needs routine updating and maintenance. To meet these infrastructure needs, utility companies often float debt products that, in turn, increase their debt loads. This debt also makes these services particularly sensitive to interest rate risk. Should rates rise, the company must offer higher yields to attract bond investors. 





Pros

Stable, long-term investments and regular dividends
Safe investments during times of economic downturns
Various investment options including bonds, ETFs, and individual company stocks



Cons

Intense regulatory oversight
Expensive infrastructure that requires continual upgrades and maintenance
Become less attractive when interest rates are high and bond yields are low





   Public Utility Companies  

The utilities sector consists of companies that provide electricity, natural gas, water, sewage, and other services to homes and businesses. Public utilities are privately owned companies that are regulated by public utility commissions that operate at a variety of jurisdictional levels, usually at the state level.



These commissions are overseen by the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners. NARUC members are responsible for assuring reliable utility service at fair and reasonable rates. In 2022, utility companies in the United States with a strong investor interest included:



NRG Energy (NRG) is an integrated power company that generates electricity and provides energy solutions and natural gas to residential, commercial, and industrial customers throughout the United States and Canada.
OGE Energy Corp (OGE) is a holding company with investments in energy and energy service providers offering physical delivery for electricity in Oklahoma and western Arkansas.
PG&E (PCG) is a holding company that, through subsidiaries, provides electricity and natural gas sales and delivery to customers primarily in California. 


   How the Utilities Sector Is Changing  

In 2020, President Joe Biden called for the country to achieve a 100% clean energy economy and net-zero greenhouse gas emissions no later than 2050, committing nearly $2 trillion in investment to achieve this goal. The energy and utility industry has an opportunity to advance its grid modernization and clean energy efforts by tapping into funds allocated in the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act which includes $65 billion earmarked for upgrading the national power infrastructure.



A 2022 industry outlook report by Deloitte identified five trends for the utilities industry which include enhanced competition, expansions in infrastructure, greater electrification of transportation, an emphasis on disaster readiness, and traditional energy players entering the renewable energy field.



According to Fidelity utility sector portfolio manager Douglas Simmons, the fundamentals of utilities in 2022 look very robust overall, driven by the ongoing shift toward renewable energy sources and away from fossil fuels.



Utilities remain wary of regulations that may force the closure of power plants, though the sector largely supported the tax credits proposed in a bill called Build Back Better, which aimed to provide more than $300 billion in direct subsidies for wind, solar, transmission, storage, carbon capture, and nuclear projects. Build Back Better failed to pass the Senate and was replaced by the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which was signed into law in August 2022. The IRA appropriates $369 billion for climate and clean energy initiatives, including tax incentives that should reduce the costs of the renewable energy transition for utilities companies.




How Quickly Are Renewable Energy Resources Growing?
Renewable energy resources are expected to grow from 12% of the US energy mix as of 2021 to 39% by 2030, according to Morgan Stanley.




What Is a Public Utility?
Public utilities are regulated by the government or state under the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners and commonly supply electricity, gas, or water to a region or area.




What Is the Largest Utility Company?
Globally, the largest utility is NextEra Energy, a provider of electricity-related services and a market capitalization of $158B as of July 2022. Its principal subsidiary, FPL, is a rate-regulated utility engaged primarily in the generation, transmission, distribution, and sale of electric energy.


   The Bottom Line  

The utilities sector is an industrial category of stocks, consisting of companies that provide basic everyday amenities, including natural gas, electricity, water, and power. Typically, investors buy utilities stocks as long-term holdings. These equities typically feature stable prices and good dividend income. The movement toward "clean" energy, along with competition-enhancing legislation and a presidential administration committed to renewable energy resources, has some financial analysts forecasting strong growth for the utilities sector in the 2020s.

These commissions are overseen by the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners. NARUC members are responsible for assuring reliable utility service at fair and reasonable rates. In 2022, utility companies in the United States with a strong investor interest included:



NRG Energy (NRG) is an integrated power company that generates electricity and provides energy solutions and natural gas to residential, commercial, and industrial customers throughout the United States and Canada.
OGE Energy Corp (OGE) is a holding company with investments in energy and energy service providers offering physical delivery for electricity in Oklahoma and western Arkansas.
PG&E (PCG) is a holding company that, through subsidiaries, provides electricity and natural gas sales and delivery to customers primarily in California. 


   How the Utilities Sector Is Changing  

In 2020, President Joe Biden called for the country to achieve a 100% clean energy economy and net-zero greenhouse gas emissions no later than 2050, committing nearly $2 trillion in investment to achieve this goal. The energy and utility industry has an opportunity to advance its grid modernization and clean energy efforts by tapping into funds allocated in the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act which includes $65 billion earmarked for upgrading the national power infrastructure.



A 2022 industry outlook report by Deloitte identified five trends for the utilities industry which include enhanced competition, expansions in infrastructure, greater electrification of transportation, an emphasis on disaster readiness, and traditional energy players entering the renewable energy field.



According to Fidelity utility sector portfolio manager Douglas Simmons, the fundamentals of utilities in 2022 look very robust overall, driven by the ongoing shift toward renewable energy sources and away from fossil fuels.



Utilities remain wary of regulations that may force the closure of power plants, though the sector largely supported the tax credits proposed in a bill called Build Back Better, which aimed to provide more than $300 billion in direct subsidies for wind, solar, transmission, storage, carbon capture, and nuclear projects. Build Back Better failed to pass the Senate and was replaced by the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which was signed into law in August 2022. The IRA appropriates $369 billion for climate and clean energy initiatives, including tax incentives that should reduce the costs of the renewable energy transition for utilities companies.




How Quickly Are Renewable Energy Resources Growing?
Renewable energy resources are expected to grow from 12% of the US energy mix as of 2021 to 39% by 2030, according to Morgan Stanley.




What Is a Public Utility?
Public utilities are regulated by the government or state under the National Association of Regulatory Utility Commissioners and commonly supply electricity, gas, or water to a region or area.




What Is the Largest Utility Company?
Globally, the largest utility is NextEra Energy, a provider of electricity-related services and a market capitalization of $158B as of July 2022. Its principal subsidiary, FPL, is a rate-regulated utility engaged primarily in the generation, transmission, distribution, and sale of electric energy.


   The Bottom Line  

The utilities sector is an industrial category of stocks, consisting of companies that provide basic everyday amenities, including natural gas, electricity, water, and power. Typically, investors buy utilities stocks as long-term holdings. These equities typically feature stable prices and good dividend income. The movement toward "clean" energy, along with competition-enhancing legislation and a presidential administration committed to renewable energy resources, has some financial analysts forecasting strong growth for the utilities sector in the 2020s.
What Is Utility?  

In economics, utility is a term used to determine the worth or value of a good or service. More specifically, utility is the total satisfaction or benefit derived from consuming a good or service. Economic theories based on rational choice usually assume that consumers will strive to maximize their utility.



The economic utility of a good or service is important to understand because it directly influences the demand, and therefore price, of that good or service. In practice, a consumer's utility is usually impossible to measure or quantify. However, some economists believe that they can indirectly estimate what is the utility of an economic good or service by employing various models.





Key Takeaways

Utility, in economics, refers to the usefulness or enjoyment a consumer can get from a service or good.Although the concept of utility is abstract, it is a useful way to explain how and why consumers make their decisions."Ordinal" utility refers to the concept of one good being more useful or desirable than another."Cardinal" utility is the idea of measuring economic value through imaginary units, known as "utils."Marginal utility is the utility gained by consuming an additional unit of a service or good.

   Understanding Utility  

The utility definition in economics is derived from the concept of usefulness. An economic good yields utility to the extent to which it's useful for satisfying a consumer’s want or need. Various schools of thought differ as to how to model economic utility and measure the usefulness of a good or service.



Utility in economics was first coined by the noted 18th-century Swiss mathematician Daniel Bernoulli. Since then, economic theory has progressed, leading to various types of economic utility.


   Ordinal Utility  

Early economists of the Spanish Scholastic tradition of the 1300s and 1400s described the economic value of goods as deriving directly from this property of usefulness and based their theories on prices and monetary exchanges.



This conception of utility was not quantified, but a qualitative property of an economic good. Later economists, particularly those of the Austrian School, developed this idea into an ordinal theory of utility, or the idea that individuals could order or rank the usefulness of various discrete units of economic goods.



Austrian economist Carl Menger, in a discovery known as the marginal revolution, used this type of framework to help him resolve the diamond-water paradox that had vexed many previous economists. Because the first available units of any economic good will be put to the most highly valued uses, and subsequent units go to lower-valued uses, this ordinal theory of utility is useful for explaining the law of diminishing marginal utility and fundamental economic laws of supply and demand.     


   Cardinal Utility  

To Bernoulli and other economists, utility is modeled as a quantifiable or cardinal property of the economic goods that a person consumes. To help with this quantitative measurement of satisfaction, economists assume a unit known as a “util” to represent the amount of psychological satisfaction a specific good or service generates for a subset of people in various situations. The concept of a measurable util makes it possible to treat economic theory and relationships using mathematical symbols and calculations.



However, it separates the theory of economic utility from actual observation and experience, since “utils” cannot actually be observed, measured, or compared between different economic goods or between individuals.



If, for example, an individual judges that a piece of pizza will yield 10 utils and that a bowl of pasta will yield 12 utils, that individual will know that eating the pasta will be more satisfying. For the producers of pizza and pasta, knowing that the average bowl of pasta will yield two additional utils will help them price pasta slightly higher than pizza.



Additionally, utils can decrease as the number of products or services consumed increases. The first slice of pizza may yield 10 utils, but as more pizza is consumed, the utils may decrease as people become full. This process will help consumers understand how to maximize their utility by allocating their money between multiple types of goods and services as well as help companies understand how to structure tiered pricing.






Economic utility can be estimated by observing a consumer's choice between similar products. However, measuring utility becomes challenging as more variables or differences are present between the choices.


   Total Utility  

If utility in economics is cardinal and measurable, the total utility (TU) is defined as the sum of the satisfaction that a person can receive from the consumption of all units of a specific product or service. Using the example above, if a person can only consume three slices of pizza and the first slice of pizza consumed yields ten utils, the second slice of pizza consumed yields eight utils, and the third slice yields two utils, the total utility of pizza would be twenty utils.


   Marginal Utility  

Marginal utility (MU) is defined as the additional (cardinal) utility gained from the consumption of one additional unit of a good or service or the additional (ordinal) use that a person has for an additional unit.



Using the same example, if the economic utility of the first slice of pizza is ten utils and the utility of the second slice is eight utils, the MU of eating the second slice is eight utils. If the utility of a third slice is two utils, the MU of eating that third slice is two utils.



In ordinal utility terms, a person might eat the first slice of pizza, share the second slice with their roommate, save the third slice for breakfast, and use the fourth slice as a doorstop.




How Do You Measure Economic Utility?
While there is no direct way to measure the utility of a certain good for an individual consumer, it is possible to estimate utility through indirect observation. For example, if a consumer is willing to spend $1 for a bottle of water but not $1.50, economists can safely state that a bottle of water has economic utility somewhere between $1 and $1.50. However, this becomes difficult in practice because of the number of variables that are present in a typical consumer's choices.




What Are the 4 Types of Economic Utility?
In behavioral economics, the four types of economic utility are form utility, time utility, place utility, and possession utility. These terms refer to the psychological importance attached to different forms of utility. For example, form utility is the result of the design of a product or service, and time utility refers to the ability of a company to provide services when the customers need them.




How Do You Invest in Utilities?
Utilities are companies that operate in the electric, water, oil, or gas sectors. These companies play a major role in industrial economies and have a total market capitalization of nearly $1.6 trillion. In addition to investing in individual companies, there are also many targeted funds that are invested in a basket of utilities-sector companies.


   The Bottom Line  

Utility can be used to measure the usefulness of goods and services to consumers. While there are limitations when more variables and differences appear in the market, various types of economic utility continue to be examined. Not only can it help companies with structuring their tiered pricing but it can also help consumers learn how to boost the utility of their purchases.
What Is a Utility Patent?  

A utility patent is a patent that covers the creation of a new or improved—and useful—product, process, or machine. A utility patent, also known as a "patent for invention," prohibits other individuals or companies from making, using, or selling the invention without authorization. When most people refer to a patent, they are most likely referring to a utility patent.


   Understanding Utility Patents  

Utility patents are very valuable assets because they give inventors exclusive commercial rights to producing and utilizing the latest technology. In turn, utility patents are difficult to obtain. For one, they are hard to write, the process may be time consuming and expensive to undertake, and their complexity may make them difficult to understand.






Utility patents cover the creation of a new or improved—and useful—product, process, or machine and give its inventor exclusive commercial rights to it for 20 years.﻿﻿



The nature of a utility patent is covered in Title 35, Part II, Chapter 10, Subsection 101 of the United States Code, which defines it as any invention for which a patent may be obtained. It reads: "Whoever invents or discovers any new and useful process, machine, manufacture, or composition of matter, or any new and useful improvement thereof, may obtain a patent therefor, subject to the conditions and requirements of this title."



Utility patents are issued by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) and last for up to 20 years. However, the patent holder may have to pay maintenance fees over that time period. Individuals who want to search whether a patent for an idea they have already exists can use the USPTO's patent search feature. Once a utility patent has been issued, inventors have the right to stop others from manufacturing, using, or selling their invention.



For many, the first step in obtaining a utility patent, aside from a unique idea, is enlisting a patent attorney or agent. They can guide an inventor through the complex utility patent filing process. The next step may be hiring a technical illustrator to draft patent drawings. When all the pieces are compiled, a filing may be made. Depending on the complexity of the invention, filing costs can range from a few thousand dollars to tens of thousands of dollars.


   Utility Patents vs. Other Patents  

A product protected by a utility patent may also obtain a design patent, which safeguards its unique visual elements and requires only drawings of a design accompanied by limited text. Design patents last for 14 to 15 years from the date of filing and can be gotten on their own.﻿﻿ To get both a utility patent and a design patent, remember that the invention must be useful and serve some practical purpose, not just decoration.



A third type of patent available is called a plant patent, and it is acquired by someone who has discovered or created a new variety of plant. It lasts 20 years from the date of filing and requires no maintenance fees.﻿﻿ ﻿﻿ Plant patents are considerably fewer than utility or design patents.


   Examples of Utility Patents  

Utility patents, the most common type issued by the USPTO, apply to a broad range of inventions, including:



Machines (e.g. something composed of moving parts, such as engines or computers)Articles of manufacture (e.g. brooms, candleholders)Processes (e.g. business processes, software)Compositions of matter (e.g. pharmaceuticals) 



According to the USPTO, more than 90% of all patents granted are utility patents.﻿﻿
What is Utility Revenue Bond?  

A utility revenue bond, also known as an essential service bond, is a type of municipal bond issued to finance a public utility that repays bondholders directly from project revenues rather than a general tax fund.





Key Takeaways

A utility revenue bond is a type of municipal bond issued to finance a public utility project that repays investors directly from project revenues.Due to the necessity of the services they provide, it is common for utility revenue bonds to feature a net revenue pledge.Investors rely on metrics such as the coverage ratio to evaluate utility revenue bonds and the projects they finance.


   Understanding Utility Revenue Bond  

A utility revenue bond is used to fund capital projects in areas considered essential to public services including hospitals, fire service, water and waste treatment facilities, and improvements to the electrical grid. These services generate revenue through customer fees, which provide cash flows that can service the debt.



Revenue bonds come with either a gross revenue or a net revenue pledge. A gross revenue pledge gives bondholder payments priority over operational or maintenance costs incurred by the project. A net revenue pledge allows for the disbursement of administrative expenses and upkeep costs before satisfying obligations to bondholders.



Utilities deliver essential services such as water and electricity. Due to the necessity of these services, it is common for utility revenue bonds to feature a net revenue pledge, as upkeep must be implemented to maintain them in good working order.



It is also common for utilities to be required to maintain a specific revenue-to-expenditure ratio. The inclusion of debt repayment is as an expense, and the ratio is often used to support customer rate increases for public utilities.


   Paying Back Utility Revenue Bonds  

Municipal bonds repay bondholders through either municipal taxation, as in a general obligation bond, or through revenue bonds. Revenue bonds derive income from the capital project. The issuer of general obligation bonds guarantees the repayment of debt via any means necessary. To collect funds, the issuer can raise taxes, issue another round of bonds, or even sell physical assets. The issuer is not constrained to a single revenue stream to satisfy obligations. Investors should be aware of this distinction and can use it as they build a diversified, fixed-income portfolio. 



Other factors come into play when credit ratings agencies or investors evaluate utility revenue bonds and the projects they finance. The coverage ratio is used to determine expected revenues to principal and interest obligations. Population size and trends can provide an idea of future revenue growth or decline for a utility project. 



Customer concentration describes the mix of consumers whose usage fees support debt repayment. If a small number of consumers use a significant portion of a public utility's service, that may lead to risk for the viability of that project's revenues.
What Is a Utilization Fee?  

A utilization fee is a periodic fee that some lenders charge borrowers whose outstanding balances exceed a certain percentage of their available credit. Utilization fees are most common on revolving lines of credit and term loans for businesses.





Key Takeaways

A utilization fee is a periodic fee that may be assessed by a lender against a borrower in addition to the interest they owe.Utilization fees are most common with revolving lines of credit and some term loans. Utilization fees are typically triggered when the borrower's outstanding balance exceeds a certain percentage of their available credit, and they are calculated based on that outstanding balance.Other common fees that may be found in loan contracts include origination fees, commitment fees, and facility fees.


   How Utilization Fees Work  

Some loans are structured in a way that makes a certain amount of money available to the borrower, but the borrower doesn't have to take it all at once in a lump sum. A line of credit is one example. A borrower might be granted a line of credit for, say, $20,000, but take only $5,000 at the outset. That leaves them another $15,000 to draw from as needed in the future. The borrower will only owe interest on the amount of debt they have outstanding at any given point.



Loans with a utilization fee impose an additional charge, typically if the borrower takes out more than a certain amount of money.



The reason is that lenders are counting on their borrowers, as a group, not to max out on their loans because of the capital demands that would put on the lender. If all of their borrowers used nearly the full amount of the credit that's available to them, lenders could be strained to come up with the money.



By charging utilization fees, a lender can create another stream of revenue to sustain its operations, while also giving borrowers an incentive to reduce or eliminate their outstanding balances in order to avoid paying these costs.





Note

Utilization fees are sometimes referred to as "usage fees." Depending on the loan contract, usage fees may be imposed not only if a borrower exceeds a certain percentage of their available credit but if they use too little of it.


   Typical Utilization Fee Terms  

If a loan or other form of credit involves utilization fees, that (and any other fees) should be spelled out in the lending agreement.



The specific terms can vary from one lender to another and according to the type of credit in question. Payment may be required annually or quarterly, with the fee based on a quarterly or even daily assessment of the borrower's outstanding balance relative to their available credit line.



Some clauses set the threshold for the outstanding balance at 33.3% of the total commitment, while others may set it at 50% before any utilization fees will be triggered. In some cases, utilization fees can be charged against the outstanding balance regardless of the percentage it represents.



Other potential charges that may be part of lending agreements include origination fees, commitment fees , and facility fees.


   Example of a Utilization Fee  

Say a business borrower has a $2 million line of credit with a utilization fee clause that sets a 50% threshold and that for three days their outstanding balance exceeded $1 million. Under many loan contracts, they would owe a utilization fee based on that period. If their outstanding balance remained below the threshold for the entire time, they would generally not owe a utilization fee at all.




What Is an Origination Fee?
An origination fee is a one-time fee charged by the lender at the outset of a loan, typically based on a percentage of the entire loan amount. Origination fees are commonly seen in installment loans, such as home mortgages, but may be found with other types of credit, as well. Origination fees are sometimes referred to as initiation fees or processing fees.




What Is a Commitment Fee?
A commitment fee is a charge that a lender may impose on a borrower in return for committing to make a line of credit available to them whenever they choose to access it. Commitment fees are typically based on the amount of credit the borrower has available but isn't using at the time. While lenders receive interest on outstanding balances, commitment fees compensate them for the rest of the money they have committed to lend but aren't otherwise profiting off of. Commitment fees can come in the form of flat fees or be based on a percentage of the unused balance.According to the Internal Revenue Service, business borrowers cannot deduct commitment fees as interest but may be able to deduct them as business expenses.




What Is a Facility Fee?
In lending jargon, a "facility" is a predetermined sum of money that a borrower can draw upon as needed. A revolving line of credit is a common example. Facility fees compensate the lender for making that money available and, unlike commitment fees, are typically changed on the total amount of the facility, not just the unused portion.




What Is a Credit Utilization Ratio?
A credit utilization ratio refers to the amount of revolving credit a borrower is using at any given time compared with the total amount of credit they have available to them. Credit utilization ratios come into play in the calculation of credit scores. In a typical FICO credit scoring formula, for example, "amounts owed" (which includes credit utilization) accounts for 30% of a person's score.Scoring formulas, as well as prospective lenders, favor individuals with lower credit utilization ratios, the idea being that someone with a high ratio may already be overextended or heading there. Generally speaking it's best for individuals to keep their credit utilization ratios below 30%.


   The Bottom Line  

Utilization fees are one of an assortment of fees that lenders can write into their loan agreements. That's one reason borrowers should read these contracts carefully and not focus solely on the interest rate that they are being charged. Even if a loan contract has a provision for utilization fees, a borrower may be able to avoid them if they keep a close eye on their outstanding balance and are careful not to exceed the threshold at which a utilization fee would be triggered.
What Is the UTXO Model?  

An unspent transaction output (UTXO) is the technical term for the amount of digital currency that remains after a cryptocurrency transaction. You can think of it as the change you receive after buying an item, but it is not a lower denomination of the currency—it is a transaction output in the database generated by the network to allow for non-exact change transactions.



The portion of the whole cryptocurrency not spent in a transaction is used as an accounting measure. Like double-entry accounting, each transaction has an input and output.



For example, imagine that 1 BTC is a bucket full of coins. Each coin represents a UTXO. If you purchase something from Bob for .5 BTC, the network will give Bob the entire bucket of coins and send back the .5 BTC you're owed in "change." You now have a UTXO worth .5 BTC that cannot be divided into smaller amounts.





Key Takeaways

A UTXO is the amount of digital currency remaining after a cryptocurrency transaction is executed.UTXOs are processed continuously and are part of the beginning and end of each transaction.When a transaction is completed, any unspent outputs are recorded into a database as inputs that can be used later for a new transaction.


   Understanding the UTXO Model  

UTXO is a protocol for distributing the bits of data that cryptocurrency is made from and can be difficult to understand initially. A cryptocurrency network or developer sees UTXO in a much different way than a day-to-day cryptocurrency user does.


  What the Network Sees  

A cryptocurrency transaction is a transfer of information within a database. Cryptocurrency is divided into small chunks, which are stored throughout the entire database and called unspent transaction outputs. Nearly all transactions create UTXO because most are not in increments of whole numbers.



This means spending does not take place using a single data byte. Instead, multiple fractions of cryptocurrency are retrieved to fulfill a spending request.






UTXOs are not cryptocurrency denominations, like satoshi for Bitcoin (BTC) or gwei for ether (ETH); however, UTXOs can be measured in these denominations.



When you initiate a transaction through your wallet, UTXOs with your information are located, unlocked, and the new owner's information is associated with the UTXO you transferred to them. They are locked once again, and that user can use them in transactions via the same process.



As transactions continue, the database becomes populated with records of ownership changes. The outputs are fractions of cryptocurrency you sent to someone that aren't spent. They are recorded into the database as inputs in fractions of cryptocurrency.


  What a User Sees  

When you decide to spend your Bitcoin, you only see the amount you've spent deducted and the amount leftover in your wallet. For you, it's similar to using a $1 bill on a $.50 item—you're given change, you put it in your pocket and go about your day.


   Goals of the UTXO Model  

The UTXO model is used in many cryptocurrencies because it allows users to track ownership of all portions of that cryptocurrency. Because cryptocurrencies were created with anonymity in mind, UTXOs are associated with the public addresses visible to the entire network.



Users cannot be identified from their ownership—unless they advertise their address—but the model allows for transparency through the addresses.






A transaction encodes the transfer of value from the fund source (your input) to the destination (the output, or the recipient).


  Downfalls of the UTXO Model  

The profusion of small coins within a cryptocurrency's network makes certain transactions uneconomic. This is because it may cost more to transact than the actual cost of the product being purchased with cryptocurrency. For example, it doesn't make sense to buy a $2 cup of coffee if the transaction fee on bitcoin’s network is greater than the price of the coffee.




Is Bitcoin a UTXO?
Unspent transaction outputs are part of the distributed database technology behind Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin uses UTXOs, but it is not a UTXO.




Is Ethereum a UTXO?
Ethereum is a cryptocurrency, so it is not a UTXO. Additionally, Ethereum uses an account-based approach with account balances, so there are no UTXOs in the Ethereum Virtual Machine.




What Is UTXO in Blockchain?
UTXOs are small, unspent chunks of cryptocurrency leftover from transactions in certain cryptocurrencies. They are recorded in the UTXO database and used in later transactions.
